As a result, many Western European and American couples went there seeking children for adoption. And a small but profitable illegal market in children for sale was created. **********Recently, scores of prospective American parents have found themselves having to spend weeks at a time in Bucharest trying to untangle both Romanian and American red tape in obtaining proper documents for adoption and for United States visas for the newly adopted children. This month about 50 of these Americans picketed the United States Embassy in Bucharest to protest delays in paperwork. **********A Romanian spokesman said in Bucharest today that on June 1 foreign adoptions would be suspended until the semi-governmental Committee for Adoptions established comprehensive new procedures. The head of the committee, Alexandra Zugravesvu, said the suspension would probably last until September. **********Last week the Chamber of Deputies of the National Assembly approved legislation aimed at halting illegal adoptions. Traian Chelebeu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the Senate, or upper house, was expected to approve the legislation next week. **********Since the overthrow of the dictatorship of President Nicolae Ceausescu, close to 7,000 Romanian children have been adopted. A State Department official said that as of May 6, Americans had adopted 1,443 Romanian children -- 480 of them in 1990. **********In that period, the pool of children eligible for adoption has shrunk considerably. In the Ceausescu era, abortions and birth control devices were illegal and, as a result, thousands of unwanted children were born. Since then, birth control devices have become widely available, and the number of abortions now greatly exceeds births. **********In recent months, foreigners have sought Romanian children for adoption both privately and through the Adoption Committee. **********Prospective American parents have encountered difficulties on both tracks. Privately offered children have been supplied with fraudulent papers that American consular officials have rejected. Children considered adoptable by the official committee have turned out not to have been legally abandoned. **********The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has become involved in the issue, insists that under American law, in order for foreign children to be eligible for American visas, it must be established that they are either orphans or were clearly abandoned by both parents. **********Still, a spokesman, Duke Austin, said the I.N.S. had issued 20 waivers for privately acquired Romanian children on \"humanitarian\" grounds and was considering 80 more waiver applications. **********The State Department's warning today, directed to \"all prospective parents contemplating travel to Romania,\" strongly urged them to contact the department before departure. **********It said general information on the adoption issue was available by calling (202) 647-8444; a travel advisory on Romania, at 647-5225, and information on American visas, at 647-0510."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/business/business-diary-may-12-17.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1991-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Diary: May 12-17", "print_headline": "Business Diary: May 12-17", "body_text": " **********COMPANIES A Giant Killer Stumbles and Takes a Big Fall **********Joseph R. Canion, president of the Compaq Computer Corporation, has to be more careful when he speaks. Last week, before the company's annual meeting, he predicted that Compaq's earnings would be down 79 percent this quarter. The analysts did not have to run those numbers through their laptops. The market value of the stock tumbled by $1.2 billion on the news. Share prices fell from $49.25 to $36. It finished the week at 35.75. Back in 1982, when Mr. Canion started the company, it was the giant killer. But inexpensive computers, some with more features, ate into its market share. Inventories built up. Last April, Compaq was forced to cut prices, which hurt profits, and Mr. Canion sold 20 percent of his stock, which hurt morale. Compaq announced that it will buy back up to 10 million shares of its stock. Good for the stock, but what about the company? Compaq should invest in high-end products, analysts say. Putting a Price on T.W.A.'s Debt  Trans World Airlines missed several payments on its $1.2 billion in debt, and now its creditors are threatening to repossess 10 airplanes and dozens of engines. That would cripple the airline. Carl C. Icahn, who owns T.W.A., wants to keep it in the air, so he is offering his creditors a deal. Mr. Icahn is willing to buy back T.W.A.'s debt, but at a deep discount -- 17.5 cents to 73 cents on the dollar, depending of what they hold. Not bad, he says, since some T.W.A. paper is trading at just 15 cents on the dollar. The creditors are understandably angry. But Mr. Icahn has leverage. He can put the airline under the protection of Chapter 11. Or, since he sold his stock in the USX Corporation last week for $1.02 billion, he could buy T.W.A.'s debt at full price. School Construction at a Profit? The man who brought advertising into the classroom now wants to build schools -- 200 of them beginning in 1996. Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications Inc., in Knoxville, Tenn., expects his schools to make a profit, but he vows not to line the hallways with billboards. He wants to blend technology with traditional methods, all for $4,300 per pupil a year -- about the national average. To build the schools, Mr. Whittle still needs to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander sits on the company's board, but Mr. Whittle claims he does not want government money. However, he will accept payment vouchers, as proposed by the Bush Administration, if that program ever gets off the ground. S&L Properties by the Bundle L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolutution Trust Corporation, figured it would take 300 years to sell off all the properties remaining from the savings and loan bailout. So he came up with a plan: Bundle the properties together, sell them to big developers and let the buyers pay the government out of earnings. Congress wants cash. **********Buying Loyalty from Viewers People used to watch CBS voluntarily. Now they need to be paid off. The network unveiled a plan last week to build viewer loyalty that is based on the frequent flyer programs of the airlines. The more you watch, the more you win, said CBS. But the network's experience with buying viewers with promotions has been almost as bad as the airlines'. Shoppers who see the CBS promotions at K-Mart stores are still going home to watch reruns on cable TV.  The End of a Fight They fought for 10 weeks, taking out advertisements in newspapers around the country, but in the end they made a deal. France's Groupe Schneider S.A., the giant electrical equipment company, acquired the Square D Company for $2.23 billion. Square D makes electrical controls for factories and the home market. So does Schneider. With the acquisition, Schneider will become the world's largest producer of electrical control products, with more than 30 percent of the American market. In the dim days of the past -- before the Reagan and Bush Administrations, that is -- that much concentration might have raised an eyebrow at the Justice Department. But Justice has given the deal a nod. A Costly Way to Increase Sales  The Saturn Corporation is trying desperately to run rings around its competition with better service and a better car. It is the General Motors Corporation's import fighter.When it mistakenly put the wrong coolant into the engines of 1,100 Saturn cars, it decided to replace the cars at no cost. A pretty good deal. But last week, G.M. said it will count each of the cars it replaces as a new-car sale. With sales like that, how long can the Saturn last? THE ECONOMY **********Housing Starts Rise Sharply . . .  The housing industry is sending signals that the end of the slump is near. The first three months were erratic, with sharp ups and downs. But April, the Commerce Department said last week, was a relief, especially for the nation's home builders. Housing starts climbed by 6.2 percent, quite a nice jump. \"The way recoveries begin is with an upturn in housing,\" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Does this upturn say the recession is nearing its end? \"Growth by the end of the year could be a positive 3.5 percent,\" he said. . . .  as Consumer Prices Inch Up  Consumer prices crept up, but only by a smidgeon. They rose by 0.2 percent in April, according to the Labor Department. \"Commodity prices are falling, and prices are rising mainly in the services,\" said Kevin Logan, chief economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. Medical services were up. So were personal and educational services like college and private school tuition. Health club memberships cost more, too. A concern, yes, but nothing that the economy cannot sustain. \"My overall outlook is for a decline in the rate of inflation,\" he said.  INTERNATIONAL **********A Defender of the Mark Resigns  Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has a line in its charter saying it must defend the mark. Karl Otto Pohl,who said that he will resign in October as the bank's president, did that job well. The mark never varied as Europe's strongest currency during his 10-year tenure. But lately Mr. Pohl has despaired. The economic merger between the two Germanys is a disaster -- his word. Economists agree. \"Since the merger, there has been no true price stability.\" said Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics in New York. \"I give Hans Tietmeyer, who's on the bank council, 70 percent odds of getting the job.\" Burning Renoirs and van Goghs?  Last week the badly slumping art market received a jolt. Ryoei Saito, the Japanese industrialist who controls Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, said his paintings would be cremated with him when he dies. Mr. Saito owns van Gogh's \"Portrait of Dr. Gachet,\" which he bought for $82.5 million last year, and \"At the Moulin de la Galette\" by Renoir. Having the paintings burned would cut inheritance taxes, Mr. Saito said. When the art world gasped, Mr. Saito reconsidered. Maybe the masterpieces would go into storage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/14/business/a-page-from-fast-food-s-menu.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1991-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Page From Fast Food's Menu", "print_headline": "A Page From Fast Food's Menu", "body_text": " **********Inspiration recently struck George Loesch during breakfast at Denny's. In scouting the competition, Mr. Loesch frequently holds breakfast meetings at fast-food restaurants, where he picks apart the sausage biscuits and eagerly devours new menu items. **********Mr. Loesch works not for a rival restaurant chain, as his fast-food fieldwork might imply, but for the Campbell Soup Company, best known for its home heat-and-serve offerings. Inspired by the popularity of a large-portion breakfast on the Denny's menu, Mr. Loesch recently shepherded to market a line of \"Big Start\" home breakfasts. The meals, which offer such entrees as pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon, are the newest addition to the Great Start brand sold by Swanson's, a division of Campbell Soup. Boasting About Borrowing **********Mr. Loesch freely acknowledges that he got the idea from Denny's, a restaurant chain owned by TW Services Inc. He even boasts of it in a sales brochure for grocers that invites them to \"take a bite out of the restaurant business\" by stocking the new Swanson product line, which was introduced in July. **********More and more makers of packaged foods are taking cues from fast-food menus. In addition to breakfasts like eggs and sausages on biscuits, the supermarket freezer case is filled these days with products like the Geo. A. Hormel & Company's Bacon Cheeseburger, Swanson's Chicken Nuggets and Tyson Foods Inc.'s Hot 'n' Spicy chicken wings -- all products that food experts say were prompted by the success of similar offerings in restaurants. **********Such are the tactics in the fierce fight over \"share of stomach,\" the food industry term for the consumer's food dollar. Americans spend more than $500 billion a year on food, and restaurants account for an increasingly larger portion of the total. **********Consumers' restaurant spending will reach $262 billion this year, or 48.5 percent of total food spending, according to estimates by Technomic, a Chicago food consulting firm, while grocery store food sales will reach $278 billion, or 51.5 percent. **********For packaged-food retailers, that is a disturbing drop from 1980, when supermarkets attracted nearly 60 percent of food spending. The trend reflects the growth of single-parent households and of households where both parents work -- situations that create a time squeeze that has benefited fast-food chains in particular. **********To fight back, supermarkets are devoting more and more space to salad bars and deli sections. And increasingly, food companies are offering grocers packaged foods that mimic items popular in restaurant settings. **********\"Instead of having a breakfast sandwich at McDonald's, you can pick one up from the freezer of your grocery store,\" said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, who predicted that many more fast-food products will show up on the grocers' shelves and freezers. **********In recent weeks, for example, Conagra Inc. and the Quaker Oats Company have joined other food companies by introducing low-fat ground beef products. The Conagra offering, which is sold at the meat counter of grocery stores, has only 4 percent fat, compared with the 20 percent or so typically found in regular ground beef.  Stalking the Mclean Deluxe **********The lean-beef trend follows McDonald's introduction last spring of Mclean Deluxe, a 91 percent fat-free hamburger that has received widespread attention. **********\"McDonald's stirred up an awful lot of interest,\" said Bill O'Neill, vice president of sales and marketing at Fairbank Farms, a maker of low-fat ground beef in Ashville, N.Y., 75 miles southwest of Buffalo. \"We piggybacked off that, big time,\" he said gleefully. **********As McDonald's introduced its Mclean in various parts of the country, Mr. O'Neill's sales force was there at every turn. \"We tried to get the scoop on where they were moving next and take the information to retailers,\" Mr. O'Neill said. That allowed retailers to tie their advertising to McDonald's Mclean introduction. **********In the case of Conagra, however, executives said their company had been working on low-fat ground beef for a year, and the timing of its introduction had nothing to do with McDonald's. With its Healthy Choice line of low-fat, low-sodium frozen dinners, Conagra has proved a nimble innovator in recent years. **********But the influence of McDonald's on the packaged-food industry is clearly evident. Mary Adolf of the Beef Industry Council in Chicago said she was deluged by calls from meat buyers at large supermarket chains seeking the names of suppliers of low-fat ground beef after the McDonald's announcement. **********\"Retailers and food service operators are duking it out for consumer dollars,\" she said. \"The move by McDonald's prompted retailers to want to market a similar type product for home use.\" **********Tim Hammonds, senior vice president for the Food Marketing Institute, a supermarket trade group in Washington, acknowledged that the growth of the fast-food chains over the last 20 years had hurt grocers. \"That industry has gained largely at the expense of the supermarket industry,\" he said. **********Recently, he said, there are indications that the weak economy has led people to eat out less and buy more food at grocery stores. With the new products, Mr. Hammonds said, \"There is a real opportunity for us to hold on to some of those customers as the economy improves.\" **********Armed with stocked freezers, supermarkets are ready to do battle with the Egg McMuffin. Although McDonald's introduced the Egg McMuffins in 1975, it was not until the company expanded its menu with a variety of breakfast sandwiches in 1986 that the category caught fire -- and the food companies' attention. 'Clones of Fast Food' **********\"We've had a tremendous onslaught of frozen breakfast products that are the clones of fast food,\" said Martin Friedman, editor of the Chicago newsletter, Gorman's New Product News. **********Executives at large food companies, however, reject the notion that fast-food restaurants act as product development labs for packaged food makers. And they argue that their companies have done a better job than restaurants of making healthy food availble. **********\"It's a real race to see who is picking up on these trends and responding,\" said William Zick, a vice president with International Flavors and Fragrances Inc., a company that makes flavorings for the prepared-food industry. **********For several reasons, restaurants tend to be more nimble. Introducing a product can cost a major packaged-food company up to $30 million, because it involves retooling production lines, creating television advertisements and new packaging. **********To test a breakfast burrito, however, McDonald's can simply ask a few stores to start serving the product. **********\"The cost of trying a new item is very small for restaurants,\" said Mr. Paul of Technomic. \"They can literally change production runs everyday.\"  Blurring the Boundaries **********Based on the number of restaurants now experimenting with skinless fried chicken, Mr. Paul expects such products to show up soon at the grocery store. **********The very boundaries between supermarkets and restaurants are becoming increasingly blurred. In a striking illustration of the overlap, Taco Bell, the fast-food Mexican restaurant operator, opened a small kiosk in a supermarket in Phoenix earlier this month. **********\"The lines between the segments are starting to come down,\" said John E. Martin, president and chief executive of Taco Bell, a unit of Pepsico Inc. **********\"Everybody is looking at everybody else,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/16/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

The air forces, which consume 12 million gallons of fuel a day, refuse to say how many tons of bombs have been dropped on Iraq and Kuwait, but the amount is generally believed to exceed what was used in all of World War II. **********\"It's almost at a point where there is no comparison,\" said the man in charge, Maj.

He remembered that one of his major thrills was the day he graduated from sweeping floors to flipping hamburgers on the short-order grill.  What Troops Really Want **********It is an experience he has not forgotten. A growing network of aluminum-sided \"Wolfburger\" stands -- named for his warrant officer -- is being set up near American positions to provide what General Pagonis says the troops really want: \"hamburgers, french fries and hot dogs.\" **********He compares the effort mounted in the desert here with the battle in North Africa between the British and Gen. Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps during World War II. **********\"The Germans lost in the desert because of logistics,\" he said. \"Rommel had a super fighting force. But when their tanks advanced, they had to go back for their resupplies. The British brought their logistics with them. They defeated Rommel by building 'log' bases forward as they went and not having to go back. That's what we will do.\" **********General Pagonis, the deputy commander for logistics of the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf, said he had begun with \"me and two other guys\" after a phone call on Aug. 3, the day after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, from the headquarters of the joint rapid deployment force in Tampa, Fla. **********Since then, the size of the logistics force has grown to about 40,000, with about 60 percent from the Reserves or National Guard. There are 92 different shoulder patches worn by the various units.  Saudi Infrastructure **********The military was fortunate that the deployment was mounted in Saudi Arabia because \"the infrastructure is so good,\" General Pagonis said, adding, \"The ports are the best in the world.\" **********Huge amounts of construction equipment and trucks, a legacy of the oil boom, were available to be rented, and hundreds of Pakistani, Filipino, Korean and other expatriate drivers and operators have been hired. This meant the Americans did not have to bring this heavy equipment with them. **********General Pagonis says his logistical problems are small compared with those of Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. **********\"I know where all his 'log' bases are,\" the general said. \"We study what his supply routes are, where his fuel points are, where he's building new ones. **********\"We're planning, if he crumbles and we have to go forward, what we have to do to sustain the operation,\" he said. \"We can use his fuel, if the Air Force leaves any and doesn't bomb it. We can use his roads, his railways, his depots and his facilities.  Hussein's Stockpiles **********\"He's built up stockpiles. But the Air Force is sure helping to blow some of that up. That's why the air campaign is so important. The air war will shape the battlefield. **********\"He has to be having tremendous problems. His repair parts for his tanks and all his equipment were from the Soviets and different places, and all that was cut off.\" He added: **********\"That doesn't mean the tanks aren't ready to fight.

Hearing Set for Dec. 2 **********The High Court judge, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, said he would reconsider whether to liquidate the bank at a hearing scheduled for Dec. 2.

It was so hot inside that Sir Nicolas gave the lawyers permission to follow his example and remove their wigs. **********Raihan Mahmud, the 49-year-old manager of the bank's Brompton Road branch in London, which the Bank of England closed along with the rest of the British operations on July 5, reflected the jubilation of the employees when the judge announced the decision. \"I'm overjoyed,\" he said. \"It's absolutely wonderful. It means that people are going to survive.\" **********\"I'm full of hope I'll get my job back; there's a very good chance for very many people to be kept,\" said Mr. Mahmud, who was born in Pakistan but who has lived in Britain for 25 years and is a British citizen. \"The Bank of England has not acted out of anyone's interest, while the majority shareholders are fully committed to making this bank survive.\" **********Depositors have about $3.25 billion at the British branches of the Luxembourg-incorporated bank. About $1.1 billion of that are sterling deposits held by 48,400 depositors throughout Britain. **********Britain's deposit insurance plan, which is financed by the banks and administered by the Bank of England, only covers sterling deposits. It will reimburse 75 percent of deposits up to a maximum compensation of $:15,000 ($25,200). The seized bank's depositors would only be able to collect from the insurance plan after a judicial liquidation order. **********Of the $:50 million ($84 million) to be provided by the Abu Dhabi owners, about $:43 million ($72.24 million) will be earmarked for the depositors' relief fund. Under the program, depositors will be able to borrow an amount equal to 75 percent of their deposits, or a maximum loan of $:5,000 ($8,400). The loans would be repaid by either the deposit insurance plan or the Bank of Credit, if it is revived.  Reasons for Request **********The Bank of England said it sought the liquidation because wrongdoing at the bank made its continued operation damaging to the public interest. Other reasons given were that the bank was insolvent and there was no prospect of it surviving as a going concern and being able to compensate depositors and give employees severance pay. **********Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, has said that he sees little likelihood that the central bank would give the seized bank permission to reopen under its present name and form in Britain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/business/company-news-alfa-romeo-aid-repayment-urged.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alfa Romeo Aid Repayment Urged", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Alfa Romeo Aid Repayment Urged", "body_text": " **********The Attorney General of the European Court recommended that the former owner of Alfa Romeo repay $700 million in state aid.

Ludwig, who is influential in national Republican circles. Officials of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the sister agency of the F.D.I.C., which inherited the case, said yesterday that the delays reflected manpower shortages and jurisictional disputes. **********The testimony of the former requlators was the second time in two weeks that the competence of the F.D.I.C. was questioned on Capitol Hill. Last week, a report by the staff of a House Budget Committee group said the F.D.I.C., which is responsible for dealing with failed banks, had mishandled the two costliest bank failures in history, using unfair selection procedures and overly generous subsidies. In Contrast to Reputation **********These complaints about the agency are a sharp contrast to its generally high regard among legislators. **********At today's hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, David Noffsinger, an assistant director for investigations at the Resolution Trust Corporation, said an inquiry was begun in July into a possible lawsuit against the former directors and officers of Mr. Ludwig's Southwest Savings and Loan Association. **********Only a few weeks earlier, the F.D.I.C. had dismissed Mark A. Blanchietti Hollander, a junior lawyer handling actions involving Southwest Savings and Loan, after he sent a memo to senior F.D.I.C. officials. **********The memo, released by the panel, raised questions about roadblocks in the Southwest case and recommended that the case be referred to more independent investigators. **********Caryl Austrian, a spokeswoman for the F.D.I.C., said Mr. Hollander was let go because \"he was unable to follow the structure of the program.\" **********Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, said the subcommittee had been unable to explore what happened to Mr. Hollander or what kind of investigation was being conducted in part because the R.T.C. declined to provide documents requested by the panel. **********The R.T.C. official supervising the inquiry told the subcommittee staff in November that the agency did not know of any interviews, the staff report said. **********Referring to the inquiry, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, asked, \"Why wasn't the matter pursued at an earlier time, because we all know leads grow cold?\" **********Mr. Ludwig, a reclusive 93-year-old shipping and real estate businessman from New York, controlled several savings and loans taken over by the Government. He did not return a call placed to his New York office. **********The losses at Southwest, which Mr. Metzenbaum estimated at more than $250 million, stemmed from a number of questionable real estate deals, some of which involved Mr. Ludwig's companies, according to a subcommittee staff report. **********Documents show that Mr. Ludwig had indemnified the directors and officers against any liability. The F.D.I.C. often sues former officers and directors, but it is rare for an owner to indemnify them.

But such approaches inevitably miss some oil and lose elements of it to evaporation. **********Another approach, favored by oil companies, is to use dispersant chemicals, which break up a slick and make it appear to go away faster. But some of the chemicals used are believed to be more toxic than oil itself, and many states have banned them. **********Some of the alternative methods under development appear to overcome these disadvantages. They are intended to recover all the oil in a spill, rather than spread it around in the environment. All tend to reduce the formation of an oil-water mixture known as mousse. And all come from small companies that are struggling to gain acceptance of their technology by skeptical regulatory agencies, clean-up organizations and the oil companies. **********One interesting approach is a mix of chemicals called Elastol, made by General Technology Applications Inc. of Manassas, Va. The principal ingredient is a synthetic rubber, polyisobutylene. **********Sprayed on an oil slick, Elastol dissolves in the oil and increases its viscosity, or thickness. Since the additive is not soluble in water, it pulls the oil into a compact mat, which can be recovered with suction equipment or a skimmer. Thus, it is the opposite of a dispersant -- it binds the oil together for removal. **********Thomas Scambos, the chairman of General Technology, said the polyisobutylene molecules are made up of long strings of atoms wrapped in tight rows, like a ball of twine. But as they dissolve in oil, the molecules relax and stretch out, creating filaments that tend to interlock with one another, holding the combined mass together. Indeed, company officials say if too much of the material is applied to an oil slick, the mixture may become too thick to pump. **********Mr. Scambos said polyisobutylene is also used in chewing gum, so it is available in food-grade purities. The other ingredients are nontoxic as well, he said. **********Unlike some oil recovery approaches that pull in large amounts of water with the oil, this process keeps the oil separate. **********At a recent demonstration at a fire training facility in Westchester County, heating oil was spread on a pool of water. A slurry of Elastol and water was sprayed on the oil and given about half an hour to dissolve. Then a floating skimmer, which had a rotating, oil-attracting polypropylene drum, was placed in the pool and attached to a truck with a large vacuum chamber. The oil was picked up by the drum, scraped off with a flexible blade and pulled into the truck by the vacuum pressure. The oil coming off the roller appeared to include little water. **********Company officials say running the mixture through a pump with a high shearing action breaks the molecular bond and that the oil can be used as originally intended. Heating oil recovered from New Haven harbor last year using this method was simply pumped back into the barge that had spilled it. **********The Elastol approach would probably not be effective against a big spill at sea, where the wave action would impede the formation of a thick mat of oil. But it could be useful in coping with smaller spills in harbors or near marshlands, said Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin in Boston. \"This is a technology that has a place in the oil spill response arsenal and may also have some value in dealing with hydrocarbon contamination in waste water,\" he said. **********But Mr. Golob said the Elastol concept has \"encountered tremendous resistance\" in the oil industry because in general this approach -- like the other new techniques under development -- is more expensive than using dispersants. Stephen Dorrler, general manager of the Northeast region of the Marine Spill Response Corporation -- the spill clean-up organization set up by the oil industry in the wake of the Exxon Valdez accident -- refused even to discuss the technology. **********Another chemical approach to oil spills has been developed by Liquid Waste Technologies of Blackwood, N.J. It uses a coagulating agent that turns liquid oil into a flexible solid that can be lifted off water. **********The oil thickener is a polymer, said William Gannon, a vice president of the company. \"The oil is absorbed into the polymer and joins in long chain molecules to form a sheet of rubber,\" he said. \"If you put this stuff in No. 2 oil, in an hour you can bounce it on the ground.\" **********He said the product, which has been used mostly for small industrial spills, can be burned or buried in landfills. \"It will not release oil, so it can go in a landfill,\" Mr. Gannon said. **********Thomas B. Reed, a research professor at the Colorado School of Mines, thinks activated sawdust is the answer. After proper heat treatment, he said, sawdust will float indefinitely and absorb oil in much the same way that activated charcoal absorbs chemicals. **********\"You can sprinkle it on the oil, wait a minute or two and then take it up with a screen or suction device,\" he said. \"When you get it ashore, you can squeeze the oil out or just burn it generate power.\" **********But, he said, it has been impossible to do a real-world test of the product, called Sea Sweep. \"The vice president for the environment of one oil company turned us over to their laboratory group,\" he said. \"But once we got there, it became clear they were not the least bit interested.\" **********Yet another new absorbent approach is San Sorb, which is being marketed by C&E Environmental Supplies in Sumner, Wash. Connie Nobles, a partner in C&E, describes it as a petrochemical-derived powder that is made up of many thin, hollow tubes, known as capillaries. Mixed in as well are fertilizers intended to promote the growth of microorganisms that naturally consume oil. **********\"When oil is spilled, the first thing you do is contain it with a boom,\" she said. \"Then you sprinkle on our product and it encapsulates the oil so the volatiles are not going into the air and other parts into the water.\" The material can then be collected disposal on land, where it gradually biodegrades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/26/business/the-media-business-end-of-slump-in-magazines-is-foreseen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "End of Slump In Magazines Is Foreseen", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; End of Slump In Magazines Is Foreseen", "body_text": " **********Four prominent magazine executives predicted yesterday that their business would soon start climbing out of the worst advertising slump in nearly two decades and would achieve renewed prominence among marketers by emphasizing editorial quality and new methods of reaching readers. **********\"The unvarnished truth about the magazine business is: This has been the toughest 18 months of my 25 years in the magazine business,\" said Thomas O.

It's been scary.\" **********But Mr. Ryder said he thought that a turnaround in advertising would start this fall, and that by the end of the decade magazines would be thriving by \"doing much more individualized editorial, leading to great targeting opportunities\" for advertisers. A Slump Last Year **********In 1990, the 173 consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau, an arm of the magazine industry, had 171,689 pages of advertising, a drop of 3.7 percent from 1989. Advertising revenue was $6.75 billion, up only 1.9 percent from 1989. **********Mr. Ryder and three competitors addressed a luncheon yesterday sponsored by the Advertising Women of New York. Also speaking were Reginald K. Brack Jr., the head of Time Warner's publishing division; D. Claeys Bahrenburg, the president of Hearst Magazines, and Bernard H. Leser, the president of Conde Nast Publications. The speakers' prominence attracted an unusually large audience of 550 people to the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel. **********The audience included a star-studded list of magazine editors and publishers, among them Betsy Carter, the editor of New York Woman; Michael Clinton, the publisher of GQ; John Mack Carter, the editor of Good Housekeeping; Ellen Levine, the new editor of Redbook, and W. Randall Jones, who recently left Esquire, where he was publisher, to become chief executive of Fidelity Publishing. **********Mr. Brack agreed with Mr. Ryder that \"the future of communications is narrowcasting,\" or targeting. He predicted that magazines would flourish by selling advertising packages in tandem with cable television companies. Both media, he said, can help marketers take aim at specific groups of consumers. **********Mr. Brack, whose company has been aggressive in packaging magazine ads with advertising in other media owned by Time Warner, said publishers who sell packages must guard the editorial quality and the individuality of their magazines. He drew a laugh from the audience when he recited what he called one of marketing's biggest lies: \"Dear, if you pass a newsstand, make sure to pick me up a Hearst magazine.\"  A Dose of Optimism **********The way the speakers saw the magazine business was rosier than one might expect. Mr. Leser, for example, dismissed much of the criticism he said had been tossed at Conde Nast for repositioning Details as a young men's magazine and for introducing a new women's magazine, Allure, in the face of the advertising slump. **********\"Great ideas don't always strike at the most opportune time,\" he said, urging others to follow their entrepreneurial instincts and not simply their wallets. **********In an interview, Mr. Leser said good ideas could be successful, even in bad times.

Last June, JMB told about 15 of the funds that Randsworth was paying out too much on its floating-rate debt and that the partnership would need some fresh capital. JMB got some of the money, but it has not proved enough. Another Infusion Needed **********JMB is once again asking some of the funds to help recapitalize the investment because although British rates have fallen, appraised property values have been falling faster. The Randsworth portfolio was bought at a high point in the London market, and the idea was to sell a few big properties to pay down the debt used for the purchase and provide working capital. But property values started to slide, and the partners decided not to sell into a falling market, which meant that the tens of millions of dollars needed would have to come from somewhere else. **********\"I am not suggesting that there has not been a further diminution of values based on current appraisals,\" said Neil G. Bluhm, JMB's president, who said that because so few transactions were being completed in London there was a growing spread between bids and asking prices. The appraisers, he said, are using the low bid prices. **********Two years ago the Randsworth deal was heralded as a big entry of American pension funds into Europe's real estate markets, and the venture has been watched carefully since. In 1989, and to a lesser extent last year, American institutional investors and developers were scrambling to invest in European property because returns outpaced those in this country. But because of high interest rates and slowing economies some of those investments have stumbled. **********Several real estate executives noted that Randsworth's poor performance to date would make pension funds less willing to put money in European property ventures. Apparently, the funds' investment managers are displeased that the portfolio's value has dropped dramatically so soon after the investment was made. **********With more than $22 billion worth of property under management for its own account and for institutional clients, JMB is one of the nation's largest privately held real estate concerns, and has one of the strongest followings among institutional investors. Portfolio Is Downgraded **********Randsworth's portfolio of about 650,000 square feet of office space and 300,000 of retail was appraised and downgraded about 11 percent by the end of last year. Although most of the properties are in west London, which has not been hurt as badly as the City district, and have low vacancies, the downgraded when appraised again this year. Land P.L.C., a Brithsh property company with big West End holdings, recently had to downgrade the value of its portfolio by 17 percent just since last year. **********Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds, known as ABP, a big Dutch pension fund and invester in Randsworth, is one institution expected to provide more moneyfor the company. But Mr. Bluhm said the Dutch giant and JMB were studying the Randsworth portfolio to determine just how much would be needed. **********\"ABP has certainly expressed an interest in putting additional capital in the company but they haven't said they would do it because we are in the middle of studying it,\" Mr. Bluhm said, adding that all investors would get the chance to put in more money on a pro-rated basis. **********Some real estate executives suggest that much of the investors' equity in the Randsworth venture had been wiped out, but Mr. Bluhm said that no one knew how much equity was left because a full assessment had not yet been completed. Still, it is clear that the equity has been significantly diluted, if not wiped out. Whether that will change depends on future property values. Half Equity, Half Debt **********The original investments in the deal were half equity and half debt, with the investors providing about $:95 million ($166 million at today's exchange rate) of equity and the same amount of debt to finance the acquisition. **********A $:185 million Citibank loan helped finance the acquisition and that loan requires more cash than the properties are generating. The properties yield only about 6 percent. London rates are down from about 14 percent to 12 percent. So either the partners chip in more or properties must be sold to service Randsworth's debt. **********Randsworth would have trouble raising other kinds of financing because capitalization rates have gone up. The portfolio already carries about $:320 million of debt, with $:135 million of that at fixed rates. **********Last June, JMB Acquisition Partners, the limited partnership that holds about 16 percent of Randsworth, called on its institutional partners to ante up $34 million that they had earlier agreed to provide. But JMB also sought an additional $100 million form the partners. **********Some of the pension funds balked at putting more money in last year, but JMB was still able to raise about $:57 million in the fall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/business/company-news-barmag-stake-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barmag Stake Sale", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Barmag Stake Sale", "body_text": " **********Akzo N.V., the Dutch chemical maker, said it would sell its remaining 15 percent of Barmag A.G., the German machinery manufacturer, to Agiv A.G., a German industrial holding company.

Dressed in fresh-pressed whites -- polo shirt, Bermuda shorts, socks and sneakers -- Mike Gibbons concentrated hard on his last shot. \"Yellow's dead on red and blue's dead on black,\" explained Mr. Gibbons, who is an executive vice president of Estee Lauder, the New York-based cosmetics giant.  \"I'm going for a rush.\" **********Click. A tap of his mallet sent the red ball rolling. Click. It hit the blue ball, sending blue through the final wicket. He raised his mallet in victory. \"This game is all about summing up a situation and making a quick decision,\" said Mr. Gibbons, a nationally ranked croquet player. \"That's why executives are good at it. We're always strategizing.\" **********Competitive croquet is a darling of the business set. The United States Croquet Association says there are 350 croquet clubs in 48 states today, up from just five in 1977. In a recent survey, it found that 88 percent of its 5,000 or so members identified themselves as businesspeople. \"Croquet has been likened to warfare on the corporate battlefield,\" said Jack Osborn, founder and president of the Palm Beach-based U.S.C.A. \"That's why it attracts so many executive types.\" **********Warfare? In a Great Gatsby-style game that's played while sipping champagne and nibbling caviar? Where sweat is caused solely by the sun? \"In golf, you play against the course,\" said Mr. Osborn. \"In croquet, you try to destroy your opponent.\" Hence, for executives, the game's charm: a sadistic streak belies its genteel veneer. \"Croquet mimics office politics,\" said Tim Quinlan, an executive at Tesco, a Long Island-based direct marketing company. \"You can really screw someone over if you want to.\" **********Serious enthusiasts are quick to contrast competitive croquet and backyard croquet.  It's like comparing the Yankees to a Little League team. Competitive croquet, either a singles or doubles match, is properly played on one-quarter-inch bentgrass with a time clock allowing 45 seconds per shot. The object seems simple: to get two different-colored balls through the six-wicket course before the other side does. But the rules -- and tactics -- are highly complex, requiring the concentration of chess and the coordination of billiards. \"It helps if you're good at problem-solving,\" said Mr. Quinlan. \"Then you can learn pretty fast.\" **********For example, Will Hiltz, an executive vice president in Smith Barney's corporate finance department, learned to play in 1980.  The next year, he made it to the United States championships -- where he came close to beating the defending champion. \"I don't think there are many other sports where I could be nationally ranked after playing for a year,\" he said. \"I could play golf my whole life and I'd never make it to Augusta.\" **********Having a national ranking makes ribbing easier to take. \"I get a lot of grief from my friends about playing croquet,\" said Bill Duncan, chairman of the First American Bank of New York. \"But there's definitely a bit of agressiveness to it. You have to know when to advance and when to retreat. You have to map out a plan.\" **********Since mental agility is valued over muscular prowess, gender makes little difference.  \"I beat men all the time,\" said Jean Arrington, secretary of the U.S.C.A. In fact, croquet was the first game that allowed women in Victorian England to compete directly with men. It's the quintessential \"level playing field\" -- which helps account for its growing popularity among convention planners. **********When Levi Strauss and Transamerica, both based in San Francisco, held management meetings last fall at the Meadowood Resort in St. Helena, Calif., croquet was on the agenda. The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach conducts clinics for beginners on business trips. \"It's not like golf, where it takes up the whole afternoon,\" says Gretchen Deweese, publicity director for the Breakers.  \"You can play a game in an hour or two, and get back to work.\" **********Like golf, however, croquet can be addictive. Robert Clayton, retired chief executive officer of the New York securities firm of Laidlaw Adams & Peck, became so enthralled that he installed a state-of-the-art court at his Long Island beach house. Several of his cronies -- including Charles Lazarus, C.E.O. of New Jersey-based Toys 'R' Us -- followed suit. \"Maintaining a court is a big commitment,\" said Mr. Clayton. \"You have to water it every day and mow it several times a week.\" The U.S.C.A. estimates that it costs about $4,000 a year to care for a standard 105-by-84-foot court. A set of top-quality equipment can run $3,500. **********While croquet has long been associated with the rich and powerful, advertisers like Rolex and BMW have only lately discovered its allure. One selling point: a 1987 U.S.C.A. study that found members had an average income of $125,000 and that 25 percent were millionaires. \"The demographics of the sport are extremely upscale,\" said Mr. Gibbons. **********But even croquet can't escape the lingering recession. Two major sponsors -- menswear manufacturer Gieves & Hawkes and retailer Abercrombie & Fitch -- have abandoned plans to host upcoming U.S.C.A. tournaments. \"They've suspended promotions for this summer due to the downturn in their industry,\" said Mr. Osborn. \"When the economy picks up, they'll be back.\" **********By then, with more public courts available and popularity on the rise, the game may have a more egalitarian following. \"I think it's losing the elitist image,\" said Ms. Arrington of the U.S.C.A. \"Some of our younger players are construction workers and machinists. They don't all drive around in Jaguars.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/business/bankruptcy-judge-named.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bankruptcy Judge Named", "print_headline": "Bankruptcy Judge Named", "body_text": " **********James Garrity Jr., the chief of the tax unit in the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, has been named a judge to fill a vacancy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.

Brady as an attempt \"to make the system safe for savers, but yet to make sure the taxpayer does not have to pay enormous bills when banks fail.\" **********The Treasury proposal, details of which were disclosed on Saturday, will be formally announced on Tuesday. It would limit the number of federally insured accounts that one person could have at a single institution. Under the proposal, each person would be limited to one $100,000 account at a single institution, as well as one $100,000 retirement account. **********\"Don't worry,\" Mr. Brady said in an interview on the ABC television program \"Business World.\" \"Savers are going to be presented with plenty of opportunity to put their money in places that they consider absolutely safe.\"  Response to Criticism **********After a series of meetings, and after hearing strong criticism recently from many bankers on a plan for sharper restrictions, senior officials at the White House and the Treasury Department agreed on Saturday about how to limit the coverage. **********People could still have multiple accounts of $100,000 at different institutions, each covered by the Government's deposit insurance. **********The plan needs the approval of Congress. **********The Treasury is also contemplating a second, more stringent part of the plan. It would call for a $100,000 insurance limit on each individual regardless of how many different banks the money is kept in. **********The Treasury proposed that such a systemwide limit be phased in after five years, after a study on the costs of adminstering such a program is conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 'A Good Approach' **********\"This seems to be a good approach,\" said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a member of the House Banking Committee. \"Insured deposits have to be limited in one way or another.\" Telephone calls to members of the Senate Banking Committee last night were not answered. **********If it is approved by Congress, the Treasury's proposed limit on accounts at a single institution would be phased in over a year, Bush Administration officials say. The curb is intended to encourage large depositors to open accounts at different banks. **********The Treasury plan will also eliminate the insurance protection provided to pension funds and other institutional investors that are able to get insurance for their huge deposits by breaking them into accounts of $100,000 or less. **********The proposed limitations on deposit insurance come at a difficult time for the nation's banks. The deposit insurance fund administered by the F.D.I.C. and financed through premiums paid by banks has been drained by numerous bank failures, a process likely to continue during the recession. Skepticism From Bankers **********Some bankers contacted yesterday were skeptical of the impact of the proposed changes. **********Richard H. Deihl, chairman and chief executive of H. F. Ahmanson & Company, a savings and loan association in Irwindale, Calif., said the limits on institutional depositors were more significant than the curbs on individuals' deposit insurance. He called the proposed changes in the deposit insurance \"window dressing,\" adding, \"They are attacking the wrong enemy.\" **********Richard D. Parsons, chairman of the Dime Savings Bank of New York, said the limits on individuals' insurance would be a difficult administrative task. **********\"This thing they are talking about creating is a nightmare,\" he said. \"I am not sure that it is going to be practical at an operational level.\" Cost-Benefit Analysis **********Regulators concluded last week that a systemwide limit of $100,000 an individual might cost as much as $1 billion to enforce. **********\"We wanted to make sure that the benefits offset the costs,\" said an Administration official who spoke on the condition that he would not be identified. **********The official said there was very poor data on the impact of the proposed restriction or more severe limitations. **********\"It has been very, very difficult to determine how much can be saved by limiting the coverage,\" he said. **********The official added that less than 6 percent of the nation's households have more than $100,000 in the nation's insured banks, savings associations and credit unions.  Diversification Encouraged **********In its plan, the Administration will also propose the elimination of laws going back to the Great Depression that prohibit the mergers of investment banks and commercial banks and also sharply limit interstate banking. It will propose the repeal of a law that bars industrial enterprises from owning commercial banks. **********Administration officials say these changes will permit banks to diversify and become more profitable, and thus fewer will have to rely on assistance from the bank insurance fund. They also hope that such measures will make banks more attractive to investors. **********The plan also substantially modifies the current policy of rescuing all depositors, no matter how large, at banks that officials consider too big to fail, by placing the decision primarily in the hands of the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve Board, instead of the F.D.I.C. **********The too-big-to-fail policy, which has been strongly criticized by lawmakers who say it is unevenly applied, was most recently invoked last month with the failure of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks. The F.D.I.C. has estimated that those three failures will ultimately cost the bank insurance fund at least $2.3 billion, which would make it one of the most expensive bailouts in history."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/business/7-oscars-for-wolves-lift-a-troubled-studio.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "7 Oscars for 'Wolves' Lift a Troubled Studio", "print_headline": "7 Oscars for 'Wolves' Lift a Troubled Studio", "body_text": " **********The seven Oscars won by \"Dances With Wolves\" Monday night at the Academy Awards ceremonies, including Best Picture, will undoubtedly give a lift to the faltering Orion Pictures Corporation. **********The awards will draw bigger crowds for the movie, which stars and was directed by Kevin Costner, even though it has been in theaters for four months. But the awards will also increase the film's value in other markets, including the eventual videocassette release. And they vindicate Orion's decision to distribute a 3-hour-10-minute Western that the conventional wisdom in Hollywood held would be a flop. **********\"What it will do for us is to give us enough impetus to keep the film in the marketplace a little longer,\" said David Forbes, Orion's head of marketing and distribution. **********What the awards will not do is clear the financial clouds that have been hovering over Orion in recent months, threatening the company's ability to survive. As Billy Crystal joked during the Oscar broadcast, \"Awakenings\" is a film about people coming out of coma; \"Reversal of Fortune\" is about someone going into a coma, and \"Dances With Wolves\" was made by a studio in a coma. **********Orion, in fact, has reached a critical point in its 13-year history. Despite the success of \"Dances With Wolves\" and, more recently, \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, Orion is reeling from a string of flops (\"Hot Spot,\" \"State of Grace,\" \"Eve of Destruction\") and from the expenses of trying to break into the television production business. **********In its third fiscal quarter, which ended last Nov. 30, Orion lost $15.6 million on revenues of $134.9 million, in contrast to a $1.8 million profit on revenues of $104.4 million a year earlier. Orion has not released its results for its fourth quarter, which ended on Feb. 28. **********\"They can probably find a way to survive,\" said Emanual Gerard, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company in New York. \"Whether they can prosper is another question.\" **********Even a few hit films will not be enough to pull Orion out of trouble. The company's long-term debt has increased to $509 million from $351 million in the last year, leaving Orion burdened with huge interest payments. Desperate for cash, it has started selling movie projects and distribution rights to other studios at what analysts consider distress-sale prices, keeping the company solvent but leaving it with few sources of new revenue in coming months and years. **********Earlier this month, for example, Orion sold one of its most promising projects, \"The Addams Family,\" based on the Charles Addams cartoons and the 1960's-era television show, to Paramount Pictures for about $20 million. Paramount is planning to make the movie, which stars Anjelica Huston as Morticia and Raul Julia as Gomez, one its major releases for the next Christmas season.  Investor Is Sought **********The company has been casting around for an investor to inject new funds into the company, and Orion's majority owner, John W. Kluge, has put his 68 percent stake in the company up for sale. The company hired Salomon Brothers last year to help it find new financing. Orion might also get some help from Michael Ovitz, the chairman of the Creative Artists Agency and Hollywood's leading deal maker. Mr. Ovitz is said to be considering seeking new investors on the company's behalf. **********But so far no one has expressed much interest in buying all or part of the company. The Sony Corporation has denied reports that it is interested in a deal, although there is considerable speculation that Castle Rock Entertainment, a production company partly owned by Sony's Columbia Pictures Entertainment unit, might strike a deal to take over Orion. Orion's stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange today at $10.375, down 87.5 cents, giving the company a market value of about $200 million. **********Orion is one of two Hollywood studios struggling to survive. The other is MGM-Pathe Communications, formed last year when Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian investor, acquired the MGM-UA film studio. Mr. Parretti is scrambling to line up additional financing to advertise and distribute the studio's movies and to pay the interest on its nearly $1 billion in bank debt and high-yield \"junk bonds.\" **********But while MGM has been fading as a movie-making force for years, Orion even now enjoys a reputation in Hollywood's creative community as a good place for actors, directors and producers to work. Its chairman, Arthur B. Krim, and its chief executive, Eric Pleskow, have forged long-term deals with Woody Allen, Ms. Foster and Mr. Costner, among others. **********\"There are many good people in the studio, but things have not gone well for them,\" Mr. Costner said Monday night after receiving the Best Picture and Best Director awards for \"Dances With Wolves.\" **********The seven Oscars won by his film, Mr. Costner said, give Orion executives a chance \"to hold their heads up and walk a step faster.\" **********Mr. Forbes, Orion's marketing and distribution chief, said, \"Historically over the past four or five years a picture does more business after it wins a Best Picture award in particular.\" He estimated that the seven awards won by the film could add 20 percent to its domestic box office revenue, currently at $136.7 million. That means it will soon surpass \"Platoon,\" which grossed $138.5 million and won the Best Picture award in 1986, as the studio's most successful film. **********But it is debatable how much of the film's success should be attributed to Orion. When Mr. Costner first proposed the film, Orion passed on it, feeling that its commercial prospects were too limited. Mr. Costner and a partner, Jim Wilson, produced the film on their own, with only partial financial support from Orion. The studio's primary involvement has been to advertise the film and distribute it to theaters, a service for which it charges an undisclosed percentage of the film's box office revenues. The studio also shares in an undisclosed percentage of the film's profits. **********The Oscar awards will probably give \"Dances With Wolves\" its biggest box office boost in foreign markets, where it has not been showing as long as in the United States. But Orion decided not to acquire the foreign rights to the movie when it made its investment in the film, so it will not benefit. The foreign rights are owned by Majestic Films International, a distribution company. **********The limits on Orion's ability to dig itself out of its hole are also illustrated by deals it made on two other recent films, \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Mermaids,\" starring Cher. **********Needing cash last year, Orion received an infusion of $23 million from Mr. Kluge, who is chairman of Metromedia Inc. Orion agreed to repay Mr. Kluge with profits from \"Mermaids,\" which was moderately successful, taking in $34.7 million at the domestic box office. In the event Mr. Kluge is not fully repaid from the profits on \"Mermaids,\" he will get a cut of the profits from \"Silence of the Lambs,\" which so far has grossed $78.7 million in the United States. **********Still, in the afterglow of the Academy Awards, and despite the coma joke, Orion executives seem confident that they are on the path to recovery. **********\" 'Dances With Wolves,' 'Silence of the Lambs' and even 'Mermaids' are an indication that we have the ability to produce, market and distribute commercial successes,\" Mr. Forbes said. \"The fact that these films have gotten great critical acclaim is an indication that there is quality and prestige in what we do here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/28/world/war-in-the-gulf-more-on-the-gulf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More on the Gulf", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF; More on the Gulf", "body_text": " **********THE PATRIOT FACTORY There had been layoffs at the plant where Patriot missiles are made, but the weapon's success now means job security.

Moves by Three Dailies **********In the last three months, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Kansas City Star and The Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois -- all owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. -- increased the single-copy price of their daily papers to 50 cents. Both the Fort Worth and Belleville papers had been sold for 25 cents and The Kansas City Star had cost 35 cents. **********In early December, The Wall Street Journal raised its price to 75 cents from 50 cents. **********Today, The New York Times raised the price of its national edition to 75 cents in the Midwest and the Southwest. It had cost 50 cents in the Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest. As a test, The Times has been selling for 75 cents in the Southeast since September, but remains at 50 cents in the Far West and Northeast, and 40 cents in the New York City area. **********Industry executives said circulation rates were rising because of the depressed advertising market and increased publishing costs. For example, the price of newsprint has gone up twice in the last seven months. **********\"The newspaper is still one of the best deals in town,\" said Jeffrey S. Klein, assistant to the publisher of The Los Angeles Times. **********But in an industry that perceives increasing readership as a key to its future, there has been considerable reluctance to charge more for a newspaper because sales almost always drop, at least temporarily. Ads vs. Circulation **********Publishers must weigh the appeal of higher revenues against the effects of lost circulation on advertisers. At the very least, newspapers that raise their prices must struggle to regain their former circulation. **********Through most of the 1980's, both the total amount of advertising and the ad rates -- which generate about 75 percent of the revenue at most papers -- were increasing steadily and there was less pressure to raise prices. **********In recent months, however, many newspapers have seen stunning drops in advertising because of the recession. Historically, when advertising revenue flags, publishers demand more money from circulation. **********\"People are likely to be more emboldened when they haven't got anyplace else to go,\" said Phillip J. Meek, president of the publishing group for Capital Cities/ABC. The Payoff in Fort Worth **********The financial returns can be substantial, even if fewer copies are sold. **********For instance, Weldon Whiteman, circulation director of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, said his paper lost 24 percent of its single-copy sales after it doubled its price to 50 cents in November. About 25,000 copies, out of a daily circulation of 259,000, are sold in racks and at newstands. **********But while The Star-Telegram received 16 cents a copy from wholesalers when the price was 25 cents, it now gets 32 cents a copy. Even with a 24 percent drop in the number of papers sold, annual revenues from single-copy sales would increase by about $650,000, to nearly $2 million. **********When the single-copy price was increased, The Star-Telegram also raised the price of home-delivery subscriptions to $10.95 a month from $9.95. Mr. Whiteman said the paper's home-delivery circulation of roughly 230,000 dropped by only 1,000. Though some subscribers canceled, the single-copy price increase had apparently pushed some other people to subscribe rather than pay more to buy the paper each day. Earlier Price Increases **********In the early 1980's, the last time that newspaper prices surged industrywide, most papers moved from 15 cents or 20 cents a copy to 25 cents and some crept up later to 35 cents. The most popular price for Sunday papers in 1980 was 50 cents or less; by 1985, almost half of them were selling for 75 cents or $1. **********Similarly, in the mid-1970's,, most papers increased to 15 cents from 10 cents and Sunday papers to 50 cents from 25 cents. **********In each case, the newspaper industry was in an advertising slump."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/world/reporter-s-notebook-mindful-of-history-congress-agonizes-over-going-to-war.html": {"writer_name": "Robin Toner", "pub_date": "1991-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Mindful of History, Congress Agonizes Over Going to War", "print_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Mindful of History, Congress Agonizes Over Going to War", "body_text": " **********These have not been glory years for Congress. Ethical storms, budget squabbling and the chronic appearance of political deadlock have all left their mark on the image of this proud institution. **********But over the last few days, as the House and Senate debated whether to authorize the President to go to war in the Persian Gulf, the lawmakers have struggled to step up to what the framers of the Constitution had in mind. **********One by one, congressmen and senators took the floor and reached for the legacy of history, for Kennedy and Roosevelt and Churchill. They spoke, too, of their children, and the children of their constituents, and of past wars and the lessons they taught.

Foley, the Speaker of the House. **********Both the press and the public galleries were full, and the lines stretched round the halls. Aides in the Senate said they could not recall the galleries so full since the debate over the Panama Canal Treaties in 1978. Sue Sexton, a 24-year-old teacher in Washington was among those waiting to enter the galleries. \"The last war was when I was six years old,\" she said. \"This is the first time I've ever experienced a crisis like this and it's very frightening.\" **********Nearby was Bob Scalese, visiting from Montana, who said simply, \"I think we've got to go to Iraq and kick some butt.\" **********In Congressional offices, the phones kept ringing: more than 3,000 calls to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's office on Friday, more than 100 calls to Representative Les Aspin's office this morning alone. **********The floor of the House and Senate is often virtually deserted when debate is waged on one piece of legislation or another. Not so today. The senators sat in their seats, quiet and subdued, as their colleagues concluded debate over the Persian Gulf resolutions. **********At 11:35, when the voting began, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and proud guardian of the Senate's tradition and prerogatives, rose to ask that the clerk repeat each senator's name and vote so \"that their responses may be clearly audible.\" But the members and senators already knew there was no hiding, no ducking this moment. **********The Speaker of the House rarely votes, but Mr. Foley broke with that custom today to take the floor in support of a resolution urging continued reliance on sanctions. \"I would not feel it right to stand behind the usual custom -- not to speak and not to vote,\" the Democrat from Washington said, his craggy face reflecting the grim nature of the moment. **********Earlier, he had delivered an impassioned defense of Congress's right to debate the President's policy without being open to the charge of giving comfort to Saddam Hussein. It would be tragic, the Speaker said, if Saddam Hussein were given the capacity \"to cripple our own Constitutional institutions.\" The Prism of War **********The burden of history was heavy in these halls, not just in what was said but in the lives of many of the men who were waging this debate. In the Senate, for example, a visitor could look across the floor this morning and see Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost a leg in Vietnam; Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who suffered grievous injuries in World War II; Senator John McCain of Arizona, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Senator Daniel Inouye, who lost his arm in Italy in World War II. **********Many of the lawmakers brought the prism of their own war, the war that they experienced, in service or outside it, to this debate. \"I guess younger members are tired of hearing World War II types always using the prelude to that war as a model for foreign policy,\" Representative Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader, told the House this afternoon. \"For so many of you, your war was the Vietnam war. That war shaped your thinking, one way or the other. Different war, different lessons.\" **********But there was anguished debate over how these lessons applied to the Persian Gulf, and gnawing fear that the wrong lessons would be drawn. When the Debate Ended **********In the end, when the votes were over, the lawmakers somberly filed out. Senator Sam Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who led the fight to give sanctions more time to work, said as he left the floor today, \"If the President decides to go to war, I will be backing the military men and women in the field.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-hearst-dow-jones-test-joint-magazine.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hearst and Dow Jones To Test Joint Magazine", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Hearst and Dow Jones To Test Joint Magazine", "body_text": " **********Hearst Magazines and Dow Jones & Company announced Wednesday that they had signed an agreement regarding the long-expected test of their personal-finance magazine, Smart Money, The Wall Street Journal Magazine of Personal Business. **********A trial issue of the joint-venture magazine is to appear on March 2.

Security council. **********Since my last report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (I.A.E.A.) and the Special Commission created under Resolution 687 have continued to conduct inspections and other activities related to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. With strong support from the United States, these bodies have been working actively under difficult conditions to identify, inspect and arrange for the elimination of these weapons and related items. As a result, Iraq has permitted some access to facilities related to these weapons, and inspectors have viewed the destruction of some ballistic missiles and chemical munitions, and catalogued large volumes of equipment related to Iraq's nuclear and other programs. **********Iraq continues, however, to misrepresent the scope of its programs in these areas, to use deception and concealment to prevent inspection teams from locating equipment subject to elimination under Resolution 687, and to deny inspection teams full and unrestricted access to facilities associated with weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. This pattern of behavior, as well as other Iraqi violations of the requirements of Resolution 687, resulted in the adoption on August 15 of Resolution 707, which condemns Iraq for these actions and holds it in material breach of its obligations. **********In addition, the IAEA Board of Governors voted on July 18 to find Iraq in violation of its Safeguards Agreement and thus of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Recently, Iraq has refused to permit the U.N. to base helicopters inside Iraq for these purposes, contrary to an explicit Security Council demand contained in Resolution 707. The United States will not tolerate the continuation of this situation, and if necessary will take action to ensure Iraqi compliance with the Council's decisions so as to fully implement Resolution 687's call for the restoration of international peace and security to the Persian Gulf region. Compensation Fund **********Significant progress has been made since my last report toward implementation of the resolution of the Security Council concerning compensation for the victims of the unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The first session of the Governing Council of the new U.N. Compensation Commission met from July 22-Aug. 2 in Geneva, and adopted criteria for the first category of claims to be considered by the Commission -- namely, claims of individuals for up to $100,000. **********The Executive Secretary of the Commission and his two deputies have been appointed, as well as a number of experts on the oil industry, banking and claims processing. The next session of the Governing Council will begin on Oct. 14, and will focus on the adoption of a mechanism for collection and monitoring of Iraqi oil export revenues, as well as criteria for other categories of claims. **********On Aug. 15, the U.N.

More than seven million people in the central and eastern Ukraine died in the famine. **********Shown through the eyes of a young boy, the film made its debut on republic-wide television today, on the eve of a referendum in which Ukrainians are expected to vote overwhelmingly for independence from the Soviet Union. **********\"I wanted people to see what life was like in a colony, the inhabitants of which were mercilessly exploited in the name of a utopian ideology,\" Mr. Yanchuk said. **********The Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party only last year issued a resolution that officially admitted that the famine was caused by the seizure of crops. Previously, all accounts of the famine were either omitted from history books or referred to as a glorious triumph of Communism. Many Contributed Money **********The 35-year-old Mr. Yanchuk said people throughout the Ukraine had donated a little over 400,000 rubles to help finance the film. Witnesses' accounts of the famine were often enclosed with the contributions. **********The idea for the film originated when Mr. Yanchuk read a screenplay on the famine written by the Ukrainian playwright Serhy Diachenko. \"As soon as I read the screenplay, I knew this was a film that had to be made,\" he recalled. **********Others who helped in the writing of the film were Vasyl Barka, a Ukrainian emigre writer whose book, \"The Yellow Prince,\" has become the classic novel about the famine, and Les Taniuk, a former director of the Moscow Art Theater. **********James Mace, staff director of the United States Commission on the Ukraine Famine, was visiting the Ukraine when he heard about Mr. Yanchuk's plans to produce the film. He advised Mr. Yanchuk to go to the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute to find material he was denied access to in his own country's archives. Eventually, Mr. Yanchuk was able to get into Ukrainian archives, but only after a long wait. **********Working on the film was an emotionally wrenching experience for Mr. Yanchuk and his crew. The film was shot in regions that had experienced the famine in the 1930's.

Colin L. Powell, said this week would be available to his field commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. **********The Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said in response to a question that the decision was driven by a desire to \"save lives.\" **********\"We think the commander should have the authority to use tear gas in search and rescue operations is the reason,\" Mr. Williams said. \"This is not chemical warfare on the battlefield. It is basically tear gas.\" **********Mr. Williams added that the United States would use such gases \"only in very specific instances. **********\"Tear gas is intended to save lives,\" he said. \"It's a way of avoiding having to shoot people.\" Some Experts Question Decision **********The decision was immediately questioned by some chemical-warfare experts who said that even the introduction of nonlethal gases could give President Saddam Hussein of Iraq a pretext to escalate in any retaliation by using the lethal chemical weapons that are already deployed with his elite forces. **********\"I don't buy that at all,\" Mr. Williams said. \"That's ridculous.\" **********Military officials and some members of the multinational military coalition who have been briefed on the decision, which was made in recent days and transmitted to General Schwarzkopf, said the rationale for granting the authority was to give the military the capability to use a weapon that is commonly employed by police forces in many countries. **********Some officials also expressed the frustration that the threat of Iraqi chemical-weapons attacks has forced United States and allied forces, as well as thousands of civilians, to spend many hours a day in cumbersome gas masks and protective clothing while no similiar allied threat has encumbered Iraqi forces. Possible Pretext for Hussein **********But some of these officials and coalition members acknowledged what one called the \"worrisome\" potential that even the use of tear gases by United States forces would hand Mr. Hussein a propaganda weapon and a pretext to escalate to something worse. **********\"One real problem is that the first use of nonlethal chemicals can then lead to escalation up the ladder,\" said Elisa D. Harris, a chemical-warfare specialist at the Brookings Institution. \"World War I began with irritant chemicals. The French began with riot control agents, then the Germans went to chlorine, then back and forth until mustard gas was the last lethal agent introduced.\" **********It is unclear whether the United States would be able to use tear gas, nausea-inducing agents or other nonlethal substances in offensive military operations, but existing regulations set forth by executive order during the Ford Administration may be interpreted for the first time in battle under the authority granted to General Schwarzkopf. **********Mr. Williams said the authority to use riot control agents was granted to United States forces during the invasion of Panama. Example of Possible Use **********One senior official from an Arab country participating in the military coalition said after a briefing by United States officials that \"a good example\" of how nonlethal gases could be used by allied forces would be in urban combat. He said the gases could be used in an operation designed to retake the Kuwaiti capital, where house-to-house combat could otherwise produce high casualties. **********In addition to tear gas, the United States inventory of nonlethal chemical agents has included vomiting agents such as Adamite that can immobilize victims. More persistent forms of tear gas have been produced that remain in the environment for weeks. The chemical agents can be delivered by hand grenades and mortar shells and from aerial bombs. **********\"Instead of killing people, you would immobilize them and save lives,\" the official said. **********International criticism over the use of herbicides and nonlethal chemical warfare agents by the United States during the Vietnam War resulted in a five-year effort to draft acceptable regulations for future military uses. It culminated in a April 8, 1975, executive order that accompanied the United States acceptance of the 1925 Geneva Protocal banning the use in war time of \"asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and of all analogous liquids.\" Document Specified Exceptions **********In the document issued by President Ford, the United States renounced the \"first use of riot control agents in war except in defensive military modes to save lives. . . .\" **********The order authorizes the use of non-lethal gases \"in situations in which civilians are used to mask or screen attacks and civilian casualties can be reduced or avoided.\" The gases could also be used \"in rescue missions in remotely isolated areas of downed air crews and passengers.\" **********Further use is allowed \"in rear echelon areas outside the zone of immediate combat to protect convoys\" from attack. The order also allows nonlethal gassing of escaping or rioting prisoners of war. **********Earlier this week, United States air forces conducted a search-and-rescue operation to extract an American pilot downed in Iraqi territory. During the operation, the rescuers opened fire on an Iraqi truck that was approaching the rescue site. Mr. Williams suggested that United States forces could have immobilized the occupants of the truck using tear gas instead of gunfire under the authority that was subsequently granted to General Schwarzkopf.  U.S. Holds Minority View **********At the Brookings Institution, Ms. Harris said that the United States has held a minority view in the United Nations that tear gas and other nonlethal agents are not prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocal. **********In United Nations debate, Ms. Harris said, \"the international community has said that tear gases are covered by the protocal and if we use them first in this war, Saddam can use that as justification to use more lethal weapons. And that is the last thing we want to do, is give him the legal justification for what we suspect he will do in any event.\" **********During the course of the Persian Gulf crisis, the United States has declined to state publicly whether it would retaliate using lethal chemical weapons in response to a chemical weapons attack by Iraqi forces. **********But during a daily Pentagon briefing on Thursday, Maj. Gen. Martin L. Brandtner responded to a query about United States policy by saying, \"To this point in time, we do not intend to use chemical weapons.\" **********At that point in the briefing, Mr. Williams stepped to the podium and interrupted General Brandtner to say, \"We would never commit or not commit ourselves to any future use of any kind of force.\" **********\"If the Iraqis were to use chemical or biological weapons,\" he continued, \"the United States would respond in the strongest way -- and we're obviously not going to take it any further than that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/12/business/the-media-business-small-fax-newspaper-shakes-up-its-press-rivals.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Jones", "pub_date": "1991-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Fax Newspaper Shakes Up Its Press Rivals", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Small Fax Newspaper Shakes Up Its Press Rivals", "body_text": " **********In two small Illinois towns, a one-page fax newspaper called Fax Today has challenged the local daily with some success, prompting predictions that similar fax papers could spread like a virus across the country and pose a threat to newspapers. **********In recent years, a number of newspapers have experimented with delivering news via facsimile machines in various formats, but thus far with only limited commercial success. **********What makes Fax Today different is that it is free to subscribers and supported by advertising. It was started in 1989 in Effingham, Ill., by Jack M. Schultz, an entrepreneur with no newspaper experience. He expanded the service to Bloomington in 1990. The enterprise is profitable, Mr. Schultz said, and he sees significant potential for growth. **********His rival in Effingham agrees. **********\"I think we're going to see this kind of thing springing up in every corner if we don't watch out for our own interests,\" said Chris Kade, marketing director of The Effingham Daily News, which started its own free fax newspaper. **********Mr. Kade said newspapers would do well to head off such competition by starting their own fax products, which cost very little to produce because the information and sales staff are already in place. **********The last two years have seen a flurry of experiments in delivering news by fax. For instance, The Chicago Tribune, The Knoxville News-Sentinel in Tennessee and The Minneapolis Star Tribune abandoned fax papers that charged a subscription fee for a one-page afternoon update of business news. \"There was interest in the product, but not enough to make it profitable,\" said Harry Moskos, editor of The News-Sentinel. Re-examination in Hartford **********The Hartford Courant continues to offer such a product, but Dennis Schain, a spokesman, said the concept was being re-examined. **********The Los Angeles Times provides a free summary of news via fax to government officials and diplomats in Moscow as a promotional vehicle. **********About 50 subscribers in foreign countries pay from $21 to $80 a month for a daily sports update via fax from USA Today, and David Mazzarella, president of Gannett International, says the venture \"covers its costs.\" **********The New York Times has three fax news products aimed at areas where the newspaper is not readily available: a six-page fax newspaper for hotels in Japan, which emphasizes Japanese news; a six-page international edition for Australia and other foreign countries, and an eight-page edition for cruise ships. **********Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The Times, declined to say whether the fax program was profitable. But she said that it was growing and that fax newspapers would be available at hotels in the Caribbean and Brazil in the next two months. **********The St. Paul Pioneer Press provides prices of up to 15 stocks in its afternoon fax paper. And The Washington Post, Dow Jones & Company and The Atlanta Journal and Constitution will fax certain information for a fee. **********Mr. Schultz's fax papers are a variation on the daily business summary concept. He sends his first edition, Fax Today Daybreak, at 6 A.M. It is a summary of international, national and business news, with late sports scores from Western states. His second edition, Fax Today, goes out at 9:30 A.M. and includes local items. **********At the bottom of both products are six small boxes for ads and a larger box with six lunch specials from local restaurants, which pay about $7 for the listing. Fax Today goes to about 180 businesses in Effingham and 380 in Bloomington. Success in Bloomington **********Mr. Schultz said he was doing best in Bloomington, where the local paper, The Pantagraph, has not started a competing fax product. Monthly revenues have increased to about $4,500 there, he said, from $2,500 six months ago. **********He said that the break-even point for such an operation was about $3,000 a month, and that at the current ad rates the potential revenues for Fax Today in Bloomington exceeded $100,000 a year. **********But Mr. Schultz foresees even higher revenues. Indeed, he has already begun trying to sell franchises in exchange for 10 percent of revenues and a $15,000 fee."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/business/finance-new-issues-792091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "body_text": " **********Pepsico Inc. is offering $500 million in one-year notes through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers Inc.

Officials in France and Italy say they would be happy to have Mr. Gorbachev come to London. **********British officials said that if the Soviets made the breakthrough on economic transformation that seemed to be promised by a plan Mr. Gorbachev's advisers will soon present to President Bush in Washington, aid projects that were in the pipeline before Mr. Gorbachev's crackdown on Lithuania in January could be quickly unblocked. Mostly Agricultural Aid **********But they said the summit participants and the international financial institutions they control showed little inclination to pledge large new amounts of aid. **********The sums that have been blocked since January amount only to a few billion dollars in agricultural loan guarantees and credits from the United States and the European Community, which pledged $600 million in food credits and $480 million in technical assistance to Moscow last December. The European Community agreed today to begin a separate $300 million emergency food shipment program by July, officials in Brussels said. **********Until the events in Lithuania, Mr. Bush and other Western leaders seemed ready to approve associate member status for the Soviet Union in the International Monetary Fund, and some officials say the summit leaders might go ahead by July. **********\"If the Soviet Union became an associate member, the I.M.F. and the World Bank could provide the technical assistance necessary to get reforms implemented and moving,\" a spokesman for the I.M.F. in Washington said, but Moscow would not be eligible for direct financial aid from these institutions until it became a full member. **********\"The basic apparatus of a market economy would have to be in place and well advanced before a move to full membership could be contemplated,\" the I.M.F. spokesman said. **********Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which has made aid and credit pledges of $33.7 billion to the Soviet Union since the cold war ended, told reporters on Wednesday on the flight back from talks with Mr. Bush in Washington that it would be senseless to pour more money into a bottomless pit before long-promised Soviet economic reforms actually took hold. **********A year from now, when the 1992 economic summit meeting is held in Munich, things could look different, Mr. Kohl said, and Mr. Gorbachev might attend then. But with a recession afflicting the United States, Britain and France, and Germany overextended by the burdens of last year's unification, governments seem unlikely to be able to provide the kind of investment capital Mr. Gorbachev needs. **********\"You have to mobilize private capital for that order of magnitude,\" said Francis Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies here. \"Gorbachev might get money from the international capital markets if they see convincing ventures to invest in, but these will not exist as long as they haven't seriously gone into a market economy, particularly in energy.\" Oil Production **********If Mr. Gorbachev did come to London for the summit meeting, Mr. Heisbourg said, \"One area he'll be listened to very seriously is oil production, which could produce serious returns financially. Oil companies have money, big money, but where are the assurances they would have the power to run the show?\" **********Oil production in the Soviet Union, long the world's biggest producer, has been declining and some experts predict it will soon become a net importer unless it gets substantial investment and technology from the West. **********A group of 24 industrial nations has pledged about $24 billion in aid to countries in Eastern Europe that have already begun the transition to market economies, and a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development based here has $12 billion to help investments in both Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. **********\"If first a serious Soviet market economic plan is elaborated and implemented with the agreement of the republics, the Soviet Union could benefit from a G-24 type of effort,\" Mr. Heisbourg said. \"By Marshall Plan standards, the $24 billion is actually not dissimilar.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/14/business/rates-falling-on-mortgages.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rates Falling On Mortgages", "print_headline": "Rates Falling On Mortgages", "body_text": " **********Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.02 percent this week, the lowest in 13 1/2 years, according to a national survey released today by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. **********The rate, down from 9.14 percent last week, was the lowest since Jan. 20, 1978, when it dropped to 8.98 percent. **********On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 6.87 percent, down from 6.93 percent last week and the lowest since Freddie Mac began tracking these types of mortgages in 1984. **********The rates do not include add- on fees known as points."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/business/business-technology-can-skim-milk-taste-like-whole-milk.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Can Skim Milk Taste Like Whole Milk?", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Can Skim Milk Taste Like Whole Milk?", "body_text": " **********All that the scientists at the Electric Power Research Institute were trying to do was find a way to conserve power in the dairy industry.

And the vast majority of those failures are small businesses, many of them started during the entrepreneurial decade of the 80's. **********The problem is that too many entrepreneurs know how to produce a product or deliver a service but do not have expertise in finance and administration. When hard times hit, the lack of management experience often throws small companies into chaos. **********\"Most small businesses are managed out of the owner's personal checkbook,\" said Peter Collins, director of emerging business services for Coopers & Lybrand in New York. \"The majority don't even have a business plan. And when something goes wrong, they don't have a plan for what to do next.\" **********Worse yet, small companies are vulnerable to a single bad decision: they might begin to founder simply because of a mistake in the advertising campaign or one bad hire. \"The smaller the company, the more precarious because there's less margin for error,\" said Abraham E. Getzler, a turnaround specialist in New York. **********Yet small companies make up the bulk of American business: 85 percent to 90 percent of the businesses in the United States employ fewer than 20 people, according to Reid Gearhart, an analyst at Dun & Bradstreet. \"When you look at the number of business failures, the impact of the large companies is insignificant,\" he said. **********When they run into trouble, though, small companies usually do not have access to the best technical help, let alone the means to pay for it. Turnaround experts offer advice on management and marketing changes, as well as ways to obtain new financing or to restructure. **********\"Eighty percent of the talent available in the turnaround business is soaked up by big corporations,\" said Cameron Adair, a turnaround consultant in Atlanta. **********And the evidence suggests that many embattled business owners just give up the ship. For example, 42 percent of the companies that filed for bankruptcy in 1990 had outstanding liabilities of less than $5,000, Mr. Gearhart said. **********If you are the owner of a business that appears to be foundering, what should you do? Above all else, don't wait too long to get help, the experts say. \"We often don't get a call for help until the businessman runs out of money,\" said Mr. Getzler. \"Running out of money is not the problem. It's only a symptom of the problem.\" **********The problem is generally inexperienced management. Studies by the Turnaround Management Association, an industry group based in Chantilly, Va., have found that \"between 70 and 75 percent of business failures are due to bad management,\" according to James A. Schuping, executive vice president. **********The credit crunch that accompanied the 1990-91 recession exacerbated the problem, these experts say. Yet trouble signs typically start showing up in a business as long as two years in advance of the crisis, said Scott G. Neill, vice president for marketing at Buccino & Associates, turnaround specialists in Chicago. **********Small-business owners are often not willing to face reality, Mr. Neill said. \"To them, every sales shortfall is simply a blip. They never see it as the harbinger of a trend.\" **********Here are some of the warning signs: *********** Double-digit growth turns into single-digit growth. *********** Product quality and customer satisfaction decline. *********** Receivables begin to lag. *********** Employees quit. *********** You accept very low margin work just so you have something to do. *********** Overhead is up. *********** Unit volume or dollar volume are down. **********You can track down some of the reasons for these symptoms yourself, and start to deal with them. For example, if your sales volume and order backlog are way down, ask yourself some questions: Which customers made up the backlog last year? Have they disappeared? Can you try to get more business from them? **********If your business is in serious trouble, however, you probably need the help of a professional turnaround specialist. But there are a couple of places you can go first to get some advice without charge. **********Small Business Development Centers, which are underwritten by the Small Business Administration and the states, provide counseling. Counselors will also help you write a business plan, according to Timothy A. Dixon, information manager at the Small Business Development Center Connection in Athens, Ga. The Association of Small Business Development Centers in Omaha will refer you to the nearest office. **********The Service Corps of Retired Executives (Score) is another resource group that operates without charge. Contact Score in Washington to find the nearest office.BRINGING IN THE CRISIS EXPERTS **********Finding a turnaround expert qualified to rescue a small business can be difficult. One of the problems is that many out-of-work executives with no special background in turnarounds are hanging out shingles as crisis managers because it has become a hot growth area. **********The Turnaround Management Association has recently published a directory of its 500 members. The directory, which costs $95, is available in many libraries. The association acknowledges, though, that it does nothing to screen its members, so you will have to interview them yourself. **********You may also be able to get a reference from your banker, lawyer or accountant or from the trade association that represents your industry. **********When interviewing a likely candidate, ask these questions: *********** How many companies have you helped turn around? What were their problems -- and how did you work through them? *********** Have you had experience as a \"hands on\" manager? *********** Have you had profit and loss responsibility in operating a company? *********** Who are your references? Do not expect to get the names of client companies, said Scott Neill at Buccino & Associates. But do get the names of lawyers and bankers the manager has worked with. *********** How does your fee schedule work? Some consultants work strictly on an hourly basis, which typically ranges from $150 to perhaps $300. Others may take an equity position in the company. *********** How have you dealt with companies that went into liquidation? How did the creditors make out and why? **********Some consultants are experts in finding financing for the company; others are predisposed to liquidate.

Despite arrest warrants, the army failed to arrest Dr. Lafontant until he tried unsuccessfully to seize power in January. **********Another important question is who Father Aristide will name as prime minister, the official responsible for forming the Government and running it from day to day.

The action, which was meant to stem rising domestic inflation and reaffirm German hegemony over European monetary policy, caught financial markets and economists off guard. **********The Bundesbank had not been expected to raise rates just eight days after the European Community nations agreed at a summit meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to create a single European monetary policy and currency by 1999. **********But today, in a surprising display of financial power and political independence, it increased the Lombard and discount rates one-half percentage point to, 9.75 percent and 8 percent, respectively, even though the move puts pressure on nations like the United States and Britian. They are trying to stimulate their economies by keeping rates low. **********\"This is the Bundesbank's way of showing they will use their power and independence without regard to the economic conditions in the rest of Europe,\" said Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. \"I was surprised at how strong the move was -- it's a somewhat daring move.\" **********The German rate rise also caused the dollar to tumble on foreign-exchange markets in New York today to 1.5575 marks, compared with 1.5715 on Wednesday, and is expected to undermine the dollar further, because investors are likely to switch to mark-denominated holdings for the higher yield. **********\"Given the differential against the dollar and European currencies, it's hard to see why any investor would not want to be in Deutsche marks,\" said Brendan Brown, chief economist for Mitsubishi Finance International P.L.C. in London. \"Begining in early January, there could be an almost unstoppable flow from other currencies, particularly the lire and the pound sterling.\" **********If Germany's trading partners respond to the Bundesbank move by putting upward pressures on their interest rates to prevent a capital flight to the mark, their recoveries could stall. **********On the plus side, however, a lower dollar lowers the price of American exports, making them more competitive in foreign markets. **********The rate increases were intended primarily to ease domestic inflationary pressures, but an outburst of public concern in Germany over plans to scrap the mark by 1999 also played a role, said Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF Bank A.G. in Frankfurt. \"Politicians completely overlooked what the Deutsche mark meant to the man in the street,\" he said. \"Then a lot of people woke up. Now the Bundesbank is telling them it's still there.\" **********Recession has bypassed Germany. Buoyed by reunification, the German economy has kept growing. Although the pace has slowed over the last six months, Germany's economy is expected to expand by at least 3 percent this year, and the country's financial strength is unrivaled in Europe. **********Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, said in Bonn that the Bundesbank's decision was a clear signal to unions and employers to keep wage increases moderate. **********Bundesbank officials made it clear that the highest German interest rates since the present currency was created in 1948, were intended to avert a wage-price spiral that could push German inflation well above its current annual rate of 4.2 percent. **********The Bundesbank's policy-setting central bank council raised Germany's short-term Lombard rate to 9.75 percent from 9.25 percent and the discount rate to 8 percent from 7.50 percent, effective Friday. The rates were previously changed on Aug. 15, when the discount rate was raised one full percentage point and the Lombard was lifted by one-quarter of a point. **********The Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, which peg their monetary policies to the Bundesbank's, also raised their key lending rates. **********The Bundesbank wants to push inflation down to an annual rate of 2 percent rate as soon as possible.

H. Blayney, a McLean, Va., financial planner, has a client with a problem: he needs to come up with $250,000 in 45 days to pay for a piece of raw land that he bought at a bankruptcy auction. Undeveloped land is often difficult to finance, particularly on such short notice. But Ms. Blayney has a solution: using a private banker. The client's financial background is strong enough to meet the banker's guidelines, Ms. Blayney said, and a check should be available in a matter of days. **********Getting loans quickly and with a minimum of red tape is perhaps the most useful service provided by private banking departments, which exist at most commercial banks and some savings banks. At their most elaborate, the departments are designed to pull all the disparate resources of a bank together in one place to help clients with all of their financial needs. In return for being assigned to a specific banker and given access to a range of financial experts, the client is expected to generate a certain amount of business or pay a minimum annual fee. **********But the level of wealth needed to qualify for private banking -- as well as the type of services provided -- now varies widely, a reflection of how competitive the highly profitable field has become. **********\"Private banking today means many different things in the marketplace, ranging from the services at J. P. Morgan to the Dime Savings Bank,\" said Bill Friesell, head of the private banking division at Citibank in New York. **********Some financial planners, like Steven B. Enright of River Vale, N.J., suggest that you still need a cool million in liquid assets to benefit fully from private banking. Others, like Barbara J. Pope, partner in charge of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse in Chicago, say clients with as little as $25,000 to deposit can find it advantageous. \"Banks also may make private banking available to you simply because of your position in the company, you are a partner in a professional firm or a small-business owner with good prospects,\" she said. **********Ms. Pope uses a private banker. She likes the convenience of being able to do a transaction -- like getting a mortgage -- simply by making a phone call. \"They just send you something to sign and that's it,\" she said. **********Lynn Shostack, an entrepreneur who runs Joyce International Inc., an office furniture manufacturer in New York, uses one, too. Ms. Shostack, who developed the private banking division at the Bankers Trust Company in New York 10 years ago, has two financial relationships, one with a major broker for investment ideas, the other with a private banker \"for everything else.\" **********\"My investment approach is quite conservative because I take all my risks in my business,\" Ms. Shostack said. \"But a private banker gives you access to large personal loans based on your balance sheet.\" **********Experts say that the crucial thing in picking a private banker is a fit between your needs and the products and services offered. Obviously, the more money you have, the more options. But don't pick a bank where you are on the lower fringe of acceptability. **********\"If you're at the bank's minimum, you're at the wrong place,\" said Barbara S. Thomas, a private banking consultant in New York. \"Look around for a place where the amount of money you have is important to the bank.\" **********Once you've identified a couple of candidates, expect to spend some time interviewing the person who would handle your account at each bank. If a private banker is to provide value, you must be able to establish a personal relationship. \"Finding a private banker is like finding a physician,\" Ms. Shostack said. \"You need to interview a lot of them. Talk to them about what their orientation is, what they think they do well.\" **********Some private banking departments are more oriented to investments, some to lending; some have a domestic focus, others international. For example, the Swiss private banks excel in global management. \"For managing liquidity worldwide, the Swiss are very, very good,\" Ms. Shostack said. On the other hand, these conservative bankers are not particularly interested in high-risk loans to entrepreneurs or in making home mortgages. \"Mortgages are best handled by a local bank,\" said Hanspeter A. Walder, vice president in the New York office of the Swiss Bank Corporation. **********Mr. Enright uses a private bank for the cash management needs of some clients who don't like the anonymity of money market mutual funds. \"Some people want to deal with a face, someone they can sit down and have lunch with,\" Mr. Enright said. \"Private banks are much more accommodating than a mutual fund family. I've never had a bad meal in a private bank dining room.\" **********But you should expect something beyond what Mr. Friesell of Citibank calls \"fuzzy hand-holding services.\" Getting a free cup of coffee while your check is cashed is not enough. \"Your wealth, income and life style should be such that there is sufficient complexity in your life to make this worthwhile,\" he said.CUTTING THROUGH THE RED TAPE **********Here are some products and services you can expect to find when dealing with a private banking department. **********Personal loans. **********You should be able to get fast service, quick approval and an interest rate close to the prime rate. \"A very good private banking customer could borrow at prime; no problem,\" said Barbara J. Pope at Price Waterhouse. **********Mortgages. **********Many private bankers will work out the terms of a mortgage to suit your needs rather than offering a product off the shelf. For example, if you plan to be in a home for a short time, you may want a five-year balloon mortgage with no points. **********Personalized services. **********If you are an entrepreneur trying to build your business, an active investor who needs big chunks of money for three to six months at a time, or perhaps a heavy traveler who needs to have financial details taken care of while you are out of town, a good private banker could do the job. **********Flexibility. **********You should get a banker who can cut through red tape and bring all the bank's services together in one place. \"The typical banker is very inflexible,\" said Steven B. Enright, a River Vale, N.J., financial planner. \"A private banker will work things out for you.\" **********Price. **********Banks price their services differently, but it boils down to the same thing: They have to make enough money on your business to make it worth their while. If you make a lot of transactions, like frequent loans, you will get a good interest rate, they will make money and everyone will be happy. If you just park your money in certificates of deposit, though, you may not be an ideal candidate for private banking. Some banks may have a minimum annual fee for those who do not generate enough transaction-related income. Others may simply turn you away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/27/business/kodak-stake-in-vortech.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1991-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak Stake In Vortech", "print_headline": "Kodak Stake In Vortech", "body_text": " **********The Eastman Kodak Company said today that it would increase its minority interest in Vortech Data Inc., and have an option to assume controlling interest in the company in 1993. **********Kodak, based in Rochester, did not disclose how much of a stake it has or would have after the transaction in Vortech, a supplier of systems used to manage medical images.

The person with the strongest voice signal is given a clear talking path, and the other person has to wait for a pause before being able to jump in. **********To deal with this, speaker-phone switches are set to change directions when receiving a strong voice signal. But the devices are still slow because they are set to exclude noise present in some situations. Because some rooms have strong echoes, for example, switches are often set so that the echo generated by voices on the speaker-phone does not interrupt the person talking. But for rooms that have no echo, the delay allowed for the echo simply makes it difficult for the listener to break into the conversation. **********\"This allows the speaker-phone to work in the way that's right for you,\" said Richard H.

These were real roots. I was looking forward to retirement in three to four years.\" **********Mr. Dyneck, a 57-year-old electrician, could have become a victim of the turmoil wrought by huge cutbacks at Union Pacific. Instead, he is happily at work in Little Rock, where he lives on a lake just outside the city. Fortunately for the nation's railroads, what it took to get him there, content with the way he was treated, is not an isolated story. **********Tens of thousands of workers at the major freight railroads have been similarly affected in the last five years as the companies, seeking lower costs, made huge job cuts in almost every line and management operation. Not all their experiences were as positive as Mr. Dyneck's, but the changes have been made without the protracted battles seen in other industries. **********Some airlines, for example, endured long, bitter strikes over work changes and layoffs designed to cut costs. One such conflict ended in the liquidation of Eastern Airlines. **********Since 1980, employment has been cut by half among the major freight railroads. That comes to about 230,000 workers in all categories, from executives to train crews. **********In Mr. Dyneck's case, his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, made sure he knew he would get help if he relocated. That included $15,000 for moving expenses and reimbursement of any money he lost between the sale of his Omaha house and the purchase of one in Little Rock. He also got a job paying at least as much as the one he left. **********To ease the social transition, the company moved him with other workers from Omaha so they would have some co-workers they already knew. Shortly after they arrived, the company threw a big bash so they could make new acquaintances. **********\"I don't say this very often,\" said Lennie Bauman, general chairman of the Brotherhood of Carmen. \"The Union Pacific went the extra mile with me on seeing that our people got what they had coming to them under our agreement and gave some things that were not even in the agreement.  \"Generally, there was hard, nose-to-nose bargaining,\" he said. \"But when everything was said and done, we were pleased with the deal we got.\" **********For most railroads, transferring and retraining workers and using new technology has led to vast increases in productivity. Cutting train crews from four to three has also helped. The Union Pacific, for example, has cut its work force to 29,000, from 45,000 in 1984. Even so, it hauled 4,158,000 cars of freight in 1990, compared with 3,188,000 in 1985. **********Productivity has soared. Million gross ton miles per employee has gone from 6.08 to 11.50, an 89 percent increase. A gross ton mile equals one ton of freight hauled for one mile. The labor cost per 1,000 gross ton miles has dropped 38 percent, from $7.26 in 1984 to $4.53 in 1990. **********The productivity gains were combined with a big capital spending program, a shakeup of lower management and a drive to computerize such tasks as the control of trains. **********Mike Walsh, who had been general manager of Cummins Engine, was brought in as chairman in 1986. Under his firm hand, the railroad has been moving away from a rigid hierarchy that focused mainly on running the trains. Under the new, looser structure, managers with more autonomy take a broader view toward satisfying customers. **********\"The name of the game is to be able to compete with truckers,\" said Graeme Lidgerwood, a railroad analyst for First Boston. \"You have to provide service that's very responsive. They are now a very customer-driven railroad.\" **********Richard K. Davidson, the chairman and chief executive officer who took over from Mr. Welch last August, said the Union Pacific was beginning to get some freight business that had been handled by trucks. Specifically, he said, the double-stack service under which rail cars are loaded with pairs of truck containers, running mostly from the West Coast to Chicago, is taking cargo from trucks. **********But the transformation has not come easy at a company that ran without major changes for decades. Mr. Walsh's proposals brought uneasiness at first, Mr. Davidson recalled. **********Mr. Davidson, who joined the railroad as a brakeman in 1960, had a bellyful of the old style. Still, he was uncertain what the changes would bring. \"I had lived with the structure for 25 years. I was scared to death that the railroad was going to collapse,\" he said. \"But it ran better.\" **********One of the first steps was to eliminate 1,650 management and professional jobs, a cut of about 28 percent. Then the regional dispatching centers were consolidated under one roof in Omaha, resulting in further large cuts in jobs. Customer service was also centralized, and regional supervisors were given a lot of authority to deal with customers and decide how to spend their budgets. When the dust settled, nine layers of management had been reduced to three. **********Along with the cuts came a dismantling of the old military-style hierarchy. \"Just the very sight of a superintendant was intimidating,\" Mr. Davidson recalled. \"It was Mr. this and Mr. that. Today there is more of a cooperative philosophy.\" **********At the same time, Tom Watts, vice president of labor relations, began the monumental task of negotiating with 15 craft unions to cut uneconomical jobs and plants left over from the railroad's 1982 merger with the Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific.  The merger agreement, overseen by the Interstate Commerce Commission, provided for cutting jobs. However, the cuts could not begin until agreements had been worked out with the unions on protection and benefits for laid-off and displaced workers. **********Initially, there was suspicion and fear. \"Our industry is not the kind that has embraced change on the spot,\" Mr. Watts recalled. There were numerous meetings with about 70 general chairmen of the unions and some 1,000 local chairmen. **********He said the company made every attempt to relocate and retrain workers who wanted to stay, but when not enough workers chose to take buyouts, it had to make cuts. Workers generally got from 15 to 17 months' pay if they chose to leave. They also got some money to pay for retraining and going back to school. **********Conductors, brakemen, engineers and other crew members had an additional benefit. Those who chose to leave were put on a reserve board, where they got 70 percent of their pay until the company found jobs for them or they left for jobs elsewhere. **********\"We tried to give everyone an opportunity to retrain,\" Mr. Watts recalled. \"The aim was to keep the hard feelings down.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/04/world/another-west-bank-settlement-starts.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1991-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 469, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another West Bank Settlement Starts", "print_headline": "Another West Bank Settlement Starts", "body_text": " **********On the eve of the scheduled resumption of Middle East peace talks, the Israeli Government took steps today toward starting a new settlement on the site where snipers killed two Jews recently in the occupied West Bank. **********Soldiers from the army's Nahal unit moved into mobile homes that Israeli settlers had put overnight at Kefar Tappuah, 25 miles north of Jerusalem. **********Just before the start of the first peace conference in Madrid on Oct. 30, unidentified gunmen fired on a busload of settlers at an intersection near that town, killing two adults and wounding half a dozen children. A small group of angry settlers quickly pitched tents, and they have since occupied the site, invoking what they call a Zionist imperative to establish new communities wherever Jewish blood is shed.

Franco Zeffirelli, the film and opera director and a member of the Florentine' board of directors, made television remarks recalling a soccer disaster six years ago when 39 people, most of them Italians, died in riots at Heysel Stadium in Brussels before a European Cup final game between Liverpool of England and Juventus. **********Juventus, newspapers quoted him as saying, \"had to climb over the dead bodies of the Heysel Stadium in win the cup.\" The Turin team, he said, was \"a peril to football.\" **********That drew a riposte from Juventus's owner, Mr. Agnelli. \"Zeffirelli,\" he said, \"is a man of great talent.\" However, the Fiat industrialist said, Mr. Zeffirelli's comments seemed to show that \"soccer can go to anyone's head.\" **********Other papers took up the cudgels. \"Zeffirelli, Dr. Jekyll of Cinema, Mr. Hyde of Soccer,\" one headline said. **********As in some other countries, Italian soccer has become synonymous with crowd violence, so much so that a team in Modena offers its season ticket-holders free insurance against injury in the stadium. **********\"If fans get punched, get bottles smashed on their heads, get bitten by dogs, they now have insurance,\" the club's president, Francesco Farina, said. His arrangement seemed to reflect the assumption, shared by others, that soccer violence is inevitable. **********\"We hope there won't be violence,\" said Giorgio Chinaglia, a onetime player for Italy's national team and for the New York Cosmos. But \"you cannot change society, he said, adding, \"Why do people go to war? -- it's human nature.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/28/business/the-economy-lives-but-will-it-ever-dance-again.html": {"writer_name": "Sylvia Nasar", "pub_date": "1991-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Economy Lives, but Will It Ever Dance Again?", "print_headline": "The Economy Lives, but Will It Ever Dance Again?", "body_text": " **********It May Be a Recovery, But It's Less Than Robust **********The recession is over and the recovery is here, according to everyone from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to New York real estate agents. But hold the bubbly and break out the beer. Most economists expect the kind of slow, shuffling climb that will cause many to wonder if the recovery will stick around come Labor Day. **********\"The indicators are mixed in any recovery,\" said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic consulting service. \"The weaker the recovery, the greater the proportion of negative reports.\" Indeed, the news last week that the gross national product grew at a trivial 0.4 percent in the spring fanned fears that the recovery was sputtering. **********The economists at DRI/McGraw-Hill are a shade more upbeat than the blue-chip consensus of economic forecasters. Even so, they expect the economy to expand at a 3.5 percent rate over the next year -- a crawl compared with the 6.5 percent average for the first year of any post-war recovery. **********Three forces will probably hold down the pace of recovery. One is a hawkish Federal Reserve and an Administration that has not seemed inclined to bolster the economy with tax cuts or job programs. Another is the legacy of shaky debts from the overbuilding in many of the nation's commercial real estate markets. Finally, there is no 1980's-style consumer spending spree on the horizon: Households are forming more slowly and saving is already low.  A Battle of Nerves - The Consumers', That Is **********In retrospect, the first stirrings of a recovery began last winter, only a month or two after the Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund had declared a recession. Though the economy was free-falling, hundreds of thousands of jobs were disappearing each month and the headlines were dire, the forces that first tipped the economy into recession were beginning to recede. **********Alan Greenspan drove down short-term interest rates. Long-term rates eased as well. The money supply, which had barely increased during the fall, took off. Oil prices plunged, taking inflation down with them. The consumer price index, which spurted at a 10 percent rate in October, actually fell in March. **********Most important, the Persian Gulf war ended in victory for the United States. Foreigners snapped up the dollar and investors celebrated by sending the war-bludgeoned stock market back to old highs. **********Because this recession, more than any in memory, was brought on by a case of nerves, a brightening in consumer spirits was critical. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait caused the biggest one-month plunge in American consumer confidence that had appeared the survey's history. When oil prices surged after the invasion, consumers expected a repeat of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, a surge in inflation and deep recession. **********Their fears were self-fulfilling. Consumers stopped buying big-ticket items that could be postponed, namely houses and cars, and business panicked too, cutting production last fall at an even faster rate than sales were declining. The better economic mood, in essence, set the stage for a reversal of fortunes. And It's All Coming Out of the Saving Rate **********Consumers, who dragged the economy into the recession, appear to be pulling it out again. That's the indication from Friday's G.N.P. report for the second quarter. **********After falling for two consecutive quarters -- one of the worst retrenchments in post-World War II history -- consumer spending rose at a robust 3.6 percent. Outlays for big-ticket items jumped even faster, by 5.2 percent. \"The mood shift led to strong consumer spending, particularly on cars, furniture and other durables whose purchases were postponed when consumers thought the sky was falling, \" Mr. Brinner said. **********Spending bottomed out in January, the month the air war against Iraq began and oil prices plunged. Despite the fact that companies were cutting deeply into their payrolls, consumer spending rose in February as employees' worries about layoffs lifted. **********First to recover was home buying. As mortgage rates dipped below 10 percent, housing became more affordable than at almost any time in more than a decade. By February, buyers were straggling back to car dealers' lots, and the traffic really picked up when manufacturers started offering better deals in May and June. Consumers began buying a little more of everything else, too, though the pattern has been erratic from month to month. **********Initially, consumers were not spending because they were any flusher. One indication: Consumers, whose income was falling or stagnant, managed to do more shopping by saving even less of their take-home pay. The saving rate has slipped to less than 4 percent recently, from around 5 percent last summer. So When Will Mores Hands Be Put to Work? **********Consumers may have the will to keep on spending. All they need is the way -- fatter wallets. That will depend on the prospects for jobs and inflation. **********As in past recessions, the labor market has been the last to show signs of improvement. When consumers started spending again, businesses did not immediately rev up production and rehire laid-off workers. Instead, companies filled orders by dipping into stocks on shelves and in storerooms -- to the tune of a $21.2 billion annual rate this spring, not much less than in the fall and winter. Industrial production did not turn up until April. Even then, businesses relied on on overtime, not extra hands, to churn out the goods. **********Companies finally started to add to their payrolls, but not until May. Payroll employment swelled by 119,000 that month, the first increase since last summer, before falling by 50,000 in June. If that net expansion is not revised away in next week's employment report, said Mr. Brinner, the recession's final month may well turn out to have been April. **********A slow recovery is likely to mean, among other things, that job growth will be less robust than after the 1981-82 recession. DRI/McGraw-Hill expects the number of payroll jobs to grow just 1 percent next year, compared with 2.6 percent in 1989. And the forecasters do not see the unemployment rate, which reached 7 percent in June, dropping below 6 percent until after 1992. **********The number of jobs is likely to grow more slowly for another reason. As the continuing stream of layoff announcements shows, companies in the defense, computer and service industries from banking to airlines, are cutting payrolls, consolidating operations and pushing fewer workers to produce more products. **********The good news is that income, especially wages, has been edging up since March. And DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecast is for income after inflation to advance at an average 1.5 percent annual rate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/business/chrysler-sets-rebates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Sets Rebates", "print_headline": "Chrysler Sets Rebates", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation announced a $700 rebate on its stripped-down Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance America models on Thursday, cutting the base price for Chrysler's least expensive car below $8,000.

But they quickly point out that now is not the time for drastic changes. They cite the economic uncertainty of the recession, the Middle East crisis and the slow-to-buy mentality of consumers. Stakes Are High **********Perhaps more than in any recent year, the stakes are high in 1991. In recent interviews, every economist and many retailers predicted that sales and earnings would show no gain, or a decline, in the first half of the year, assuming a Middle East war or prolonged stalemate. They said they expected a gradual improvement in the second half of the year, assuming a resolution in the Middle East. **********Retailers find some glimmers of hope in the prospect of lower interest rates. **********The urgency this year is that weak retailers and those with high debts stand to lose local or national market share unless they move to improve their marketing position with new operating concepts. **********\"In such a situation, we can either roll over and play dead or be imaginative and aggressive,\" said Stanley Marcus, the former chairman of Neiman Marcus. \"There really isn't much choice this year. There's a danger and hazard no matter what we do.\" **********Those that have been successful in the last few years, notably general discount merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, specialty outlets like the Circuit City Stores electronics chain and clothing stores like the Limited, have not hesitated to announce strong expansion plans. **********These chains plan to open new stores or make acquisitions to increase the size of their existing units or enter new markets. **********That will make it much harder for several giant retailers already under severe pressure. These include Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, which last week announced it was eliminating 21,000 jobs to cut expenses; Federated Department Stores and the Allied Stores Corporation, two major chains now in voluntary bankruptcy; R. H. Macy & Company, which has been selling equity to reduce debt, and Ames Department Stores, a discounter that is in voluntary bankruptcy. Altered Priorities **********Are there culprits for retailing's distress? One of America's most renowned designers, Geoffrey Beene, criticized the industry's merger and acquisition binge, saying the result had altered priorities to \"cater to owners and creditors, not to the customers.\" **********For now, Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis, said: \"It is a time to execute better all that we do rather than a time for uniqueness. The consumer is restless and has expectations of us that we can't afford to ignore in terms of service, being in stock on desirable goods and offering fair prices. We expect a tough first half and then a gradual pickup. But we are planning to be very cautious so that we don't have a lot of leftover inventory.\" **********That strategy means strict control over how much and what style of merchandise to order, even to the point of risking running short on some items that customers want. **********But stores that can afford to are trying new concepts in merchandising. Circuit City plans to open many more of its small Impulse stores that sell smaller-size electronics items. **********People who follow the industry say it seems clear that the more \"focused\" retailer fared the best in 1990 and in the holiday season. For retailers, focused means presenting a clear picture of merchandise and service so that their store becomes a destination for consumers rather than a place to wander into. **********Despite a 1990 that many retailers would rather forget, there were still several successes. Among them was Montgomery Ward, which expects to report record profits for 1990. Executives there mentioned their strategy for selling a four-head videocassette recorder for $248, the amount usually charged for a two-head machine that does not have comparable video or audio quality. **********As Bernard Brennan, Ward's chairman, put it: \"This was a way we could focus on particular merchandise. We sat down with some VCR producers, showed them our specs and guaranteed a large order. Last year, we sold almost $40 million worth of those recorders, or 160,000 units. That was about 3 percent of the total U.S. VCR market in sales.\" **********For 1991, one potentially promising new retailing move is in the works by Frederick Atkins Inc., the New York-based research-merchandising organization owned by 29 large retail chains. It has developed what it calls an environmentally friendly line of sportswear called \"Clean Clothes,\" which is expected to be sold in stores early next month. This 400-item line, which officials hope will tap the growing interest in ecology, is made of all-cotton fabrics with no synthetics. Paper wrappings are recyclable and buttons are made of wood rather than plastic. **********Lee Abraham, chairman of the Associated Merchandising Corporation, a large research-merchandising arm in New York owned by large retailers, said, \"One of my chief concerns is that given the current, economic conditions, retailers may resist investing in the technology they need to move forward strategically.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/23/world/war-in-the-gulf-strategy-the-air-or-the-ground-a-debate-over-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Air or the Ground: A Debate Over Strategy", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: STRATEGY; The Air or the Ground: A Debate Over Strategy", "body_text": " **********With the American Air Force trying to destroy Iraq's military abilities, a debate is developing in Washington over whether the United States should resort to a ground war to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait, considering the large number of American casualties that could result. **********For now this debate appears to be confined to members of Congress and experts outside the Bush Administration. The Administration itself still seems committed to a strategy of using air power first to destroy as much of Iraq's military potential as possible, to weaken the Iraqi Army in Kuwait and sever its communications links with Baghdad, and then to use American, Arab and European ground troops to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. **********But this approach is being criticized in two different arguments, and the criticism is mounting each day. One argument is purely military. It contends that over time, air power can force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait -- even though historically no war has ever been won from the air alone. **********For instance, Edward N. Luttwak, a military historian at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, argues that the air force should focus on bombing all roads, supply lines and supply trucks that connect southern Iraq with the 500,000-strong Iraqi garrison in Kuwait. Eventually, Mr. Luttwak says, the Iraqis will be starved into leaving, since Kuwait is all desert and supplies of food and water for Iraqi troops there are limited; it just takes patience and concentrated bombing of supply lines. Lesson of History **********\"There are thousands of Iraqi troops in Kuwait,\" Mr. Luttwak said. \"They require hundreds of trucks each day just to feed them. The war that can force a withdrawal from Kuwait is the air war that attacks those trucks.\" **********Those who oppose this strategy, Mr. Luttwak said, claim that the Iraqis in Kuwait have stored months of supplies. **********\"My answer to that,\" he said, \"is that I don't believe it is true, but even if it is, I would rather bomb them for months from the air rather than have thousands of Americans coming home in wheelchairs.\" **********Eliot A. Cohen, a professor of strategic studies at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, also argues that an air war alone can produce an Iraqi withdrawal, even though the lesson of history is otherwise. Mr. Cohen said this war is unique because of the scale of the air power deployed, the accuracy of the bombs and the ability of allied air forces to fly at night on a large scale. Over time, he argues, such air power is capable of paralyzing life in Iraq, or administering such a pounding that the Iraqis will have to withdraw from Kuwait. More Even Footing on Ground **********There are two other military reasons for relying on air power rather than a ground campaign, Mr. Cohen maintains. First, it is politically essential for the future standing of America and its allies in the Arab world that the coalition appear to be pummeling the Iraqis without meeting much resistance. The minute a ground war begins, the two sides will be on a much more equal footing and the casualty totals will be much closer. **********Second, it is easier to start a ground war than it is to finish it. Even if the Iraqis are driven from Kuwait, what if they continue shelling Kuwait from the Iraqi side of the border, Mr. Cohen asks. Does the United States really want to be involved in a potential occupation of southern Iraq? **********The other emerging argument against a ground war in Kuwait is a political one. It contends that America's real vital interest in the gulf is destroying Iraq's military potential so that it will not be able to threaten any of its neighbors for the forseeable future. This objective can be achieved at a relatively low cost through air power and sustained bombings. Once it is, Iraq's garrison in Kuwait should be ignored. It is not of vital interest to the United States, the argument goes, to restore the Emir of Kuwait to his throne, which might be achieved only through a very costly ground war. **********\"When we start having ground losses and Americans start seeing the Emir of Kuwait and his 80 wives on television and we see the Kuwaiti and Saudi students driving fancy cars at our local community colleges, a lot of people in this country are going to be very unhappy,\" said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. \"People understand that Saddam Hussein is a threat, that he has an enormous amount of weapons. But restoring the Emir, no, no, no.\" 'Starve Them Out' **********Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a critic of the Administration's gulf strategy from the beginning, said that now that the United States has committed itself to war, it should adopt a strategy that will result in the fewest casulaties. **********\"I am against the whole damn thing,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"I don't think anything out there is worth the life of a single American soldier. But if we have to do something, I prefer to rely on air power and a blockade to starve them out.\" **********While Administration officials say such arguments are made by Democrats who always oppose any use of force, Republican lawmakers are taking them more seriously. **********For instance, after being briefed by the Pentagon on the war effort, the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel, a co-sponsor of the House resolution authorizing the use of force, said on Monday that considering the high cost of a ground war in Kuwait, he would not press the President to take up that option quickly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/korean-bank-gets-loan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Korean Bank Gets Loan", "print_headline": "Korean Bank Gets Loan", "body_text": " **********The Commercial Bank of Korea will sign a $30 million offshore syndicated loan in Hong Kong to expand foreign currency loans to domestic companies, bank officials said.

It also strengthens the attempt by the Government of President Elias Hrawi to get Israel to pull out of the strip of southern Lebanese territory that it has occupied. Israel says it needs the area as a buffer against attacks by P.L.O. guerrillas.  P.L.O. Lost Beirut Bases in '82 **********The P.L.O. has had a strong military and political presence in Lebanon for two decades.

Among the dead were 65 guerrillas, three Lebanese soldiers and the rest civilians, according to the police.

Mr. Wehbeh said guerrilla weapons would be placed in trust with Sidon leaders. Security officials said that the P.L.O.'s big guns would be stored for now and then shipped out of Lebanon.  Jobs Opened to Palestinians **********The Government in Beirut also told 400,000 Palestinian civilians living in the country that restrictions on their freedom to hold jobs have been lifted. **********The move is widely seen as an inducement for the Palestinians to accept a back seat to the new national order, under which the central Government in Beirut has been consolidating its powers against armed factions that had turned Lebanon into a patchwork of fiefdoms. **********A Lebanese Government official said the Government would not enter into any further agreements like one concluded with Mr. Arafat in November 1969, which allowed the P.L.O. to establish guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon.

Outside the Kremlin, there are not many who believe that the measure will bring more than another spiral of misery. **********The increases, announced on March 19, have long been considered a prerequisite for authentic economic change in the Soviet Union, where centrally set prices long ago lost any relation to the cost of producing the goods. **********But the increases come at a time when many Soviet citizens have lost faith in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic and social restructuring, and they risk being seen as another futile imposition of authority by the central Government. The Usual Skepticism **********Independent economists have voiced skepticism that the increases, in the absence of other moves toward a free market, will have a long-term effect. In two to four months, they predict, inflation and Government spending will swallow up benefits, restoring and perhaps worsening shortages. **********Predictably, people have reacted by hoarding what few goods reach the state stores, emptying shelves even of basic items like salt. For days, parents have formed long lines to buy children's clothing, worrying that it will be unaffordable by the time their children outgrow what they wear now. **********The effect of the new prices will be widespread. The cost of a little more than two pounds of beef will rise from two rubles to seven, and the cost of the same amount of flour will rise from 46 kopecks to 1.40 rubles. A man's suit will go from 107 rubles to 245; a convertible sofa from 188 rubles to 346, and a color television from 755 rubles to 1,218. What's a Ruble Worth? **********At the exchange rate for tourists, a ruble is traded at 6 to the dollar, but on the black market the rate ranges up to 35 rubles to the dollar. A well-paid worker earns about 600 rubles a month, while employees of independent cooperatives generally make in excess of 1,000 rubles. **********To soften the blow of the increases, the Kremlin has promised to give raises of 60 percent to workers at state-owned enterprises and to lift the value of savings accounts at state banks by 40 percent. But most of the new savings have been frozen until 1994, when inflation should eat up most of the increase. The effect for the majority of wage-earning Russians, therefore, will be diminished savings and a sharp drop in buying power. **********The day-to-day effect of the increases, however, is hard to guage. For one thing, Government edicts spelling out the changes raise as many questions as they answer. **********Most people assume that the Government has set aside supplies of products to put on the market immediately after prices go up, to ease the shock and to create the illusion that they are having an immediate effect.  Back-Door Deals **********Everyone agrees that the increases will be painful and confusing. But in a system where survival requires constant improvising and back-door deals, the real effects of the change will not become evident for some time. **********Very few people in this country live entirely from the shelves of state-run stores, where finding anything has come to be regarded as a stroke of luck. Almost all Russians supplement the few products they find there through a variety of channels -- \"through the back\" from store directors; at commercial prices at cooperative stores; at freely negotiated prices at farmers' markets; on the black market, or through their own labor. **********The cost of beef at a farmers' markets, where the price is set by demand, already goes for 25 to 30 rubles a kilogram, which is a little more than two pounds. Many people manage to pick up several more pounds of beef from the cafeteria at their work places for about three rubles a kilogram. How these other prices react to the official price rise is yet to be seen. **********To further complicate matters, methods of distribution differ widely from city to city and region to region. In Moscow, for example, only vodka, cigarettes and sugar are rationed, but residents must show cards establishing their addresses to shop in certain stores. In Leningrad, by contrast, meat and most other staples are distributed through ration coupons. **********Skepticism is widespread. Kommersant, the respected weekly of the Union of Cooperatives, published a review of the price project under the headline, \"Price Reform: Heaven Forbid That It Be the Last One.\" **********It predicted that the initial effect of the measure will be to reduce consumer sales by 20 to 25 percent as people delve into their hoarded supplies and come to grips with the new prices. The reduction in spending money will also curtail private enterprise, creating more demand for short-term bank credits, it said. **********But in the long run, the paper argued, the shock of the new prices will force the Government to increase its spending, thus undermining the effects of the reform. **********Writing in Moscow News, two economists, Andrei Vavilov and Oleg Vyugin, agreed that the price increases could bring a month or two of relative prosperity, but beyond that, they said, they suggested \"no hope for the market's long-term stabilization.\" **********The only way to avoid hyperinflation, they said, was if the April increases were to become the first step on the way to \"radical reform,\" including a further freeing of prices, extensive privatization and encouragement of free enterprise. **********Out in the streets, the arguments were less over economic effects than the waning credibility of perestroika. A year ago, the Government of then-Prime Minister Nikolai I.

But the three Continental powers also have stressed they wanted to do more than their their partners in the Group of Seven industrial powers. **********\"We formed a sub-group that carried out a job of persuasion,\" one French official said, noting that France's President Francois Mitterrand, Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Italy's Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti lunched privately before Mr. Gorbachev met the Group of Seven. **********The official added that, while as host of the summit meeting, Prime Minister John Major of Britain was intent on building a consensus among the Group of Seven, he also left no doubt that he leaned towards the more flexible approach favored by the other three European leaders, but had to go along with the less generous approach favored particularly by Washington. **********The United States has repeatedly stressed that aid should be limited until the Soviet Union has actually taken the hard political moves to take it into a more market-oriented economy. It is always possible, of course, that President Bush, when he goes to Moscow at the end of the month for a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, may loosen up on the question, but American officials say that beyond going ahead with seeking most-favored-nation tariff treatment for Moscow, it it unlikely that Washington will go beyond what was agreed to in London. **********Political experts noted that, because of their proximity to the Soviet Union, the European members of the Group of Seven believe the collapse of Mr. Gorbachev's liberalization effort would affect them much more severely than it would the United States, Japan and Canada.  Early Recognition of Gorbachev **********They also recalled that, after Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985, Britain, France and Germany were far quicker than Washington in recognizing, in the words of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, that they could \"do business\" with him. **********Further, no less than President Bush, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl both believe they have a special relationship with Mr. Gorbachev, with the German leader particularly grateful that he permitted the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and accepted the unification of Germany. **********France, Germany and Italy backed early Soviet entry to the International Monetary Fund as a full member -- instead of an undefined period of associate membership -- as well as more credit from a new European Development Bank. They were blocked by the United States, Japan and Canada.  Follow-Up in Moscow **********But they considered it a victory that the relationship with Moscow was institutionalized through annual meetings between the rotating president of the Group of Seven and the Soviet President. And they noted that finance ministers from the Seven will soon travel to Moscow for further talks. **********Still more important for Mr. Gorbachev, the three governments have stressed that the London summit is merely the first step. Refering to the decision to give Moscow only associate membership of the I.M.F., Mr. Andreotti noted today: \"The problem is not closed of course.\" **********In Bonn, while German newspapers described the summit as a personal failure for Mr. Kohl, Germany's Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the Group of Seven had \"begun a process which would have as its conclusion the full integration of the Soviet Union in the world economy.\" **********On Wednesday, Mr. Mitterrand went out of his way to praise Mr. Gorbachev and noted that, when it comes to helping Moscow, \"France belongs to those who believe it is better to assume the risk now than to accept the alternative risk that could lead the experience to failure.\" **********French officials said that the European powers had no plan to launch an independent initiative to step up aid for the Soviet Union, but would continue to work in that direction in other forums, including the 12-nation European Community and international financial organizations. **********The London summit's failure to promise direct aid to Moscow, however, was seen as a setback for Germany. Since the Germans currently provide around 60 percent of all Western aid to the Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl had hoped to persuade his Group of Seven partners to assume a greater share of this burden."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/13/business/briefs-851091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 292, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Buffton Corp., Fort Worth, a maker of electronic and plastic products, sold its National Pipe Co. operations to LCP National Plastics Inc., and its National Conduit Co. to its former owner, Jaakko Uuranniemi.

The insurers hope to shape new laws being drafted that will crack down on practices like the blacklisting of certain occupations, red-lining of neighborhoods and price gouging. **********But the commercial insurers and Blue Cross and Blue Shield groups are fighting one another on some issues. Under the commercial companies' plan, the 10 largest insurers of small groups in each state would pay for a backup reinsurance pool to help cover high-risk customers. But some Blue Cross groups already cover all applicants, albeit at high premiums. So the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association says participation in reinsurance pools should not be compulsory in every state. **********Under both the Blue Cross and the commercial proposals, coverage would be offered to all applicants, regardless of health status, occupation or geographic location. For those labeled as high risks, premiums could still be 50 percent higher than for others. That would be progress, the insurers say, compared with 400 percent differentials charged by some companies. **********The Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group for 300 commercial insurers, is pushing a package with reinsurance in New Jersey, Minnesota and Maine and says it will probably be offered soon in Ohio and Wisconsin. \"These are proposals that would greatly restrict our ability to make money in the small group market,\" said Carl Schramm, the association president. **********But in a policy called open enrollment, Blue Cross plans already accept all comers in 13 states and the District of Columbia. In most cases, they charge the same rates, regardless of occupation or health status, which is called community rating. These associations object to helping the commercial companies with the reinsurance plan. **********Individuals in New York state can obtain Blue Cross coverage at any time, said Albert A. Cardone, chairman of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Although new members are not covered during the first 11 months for pre-existing conditions, they are fully covered afterward, even for AIDS. But Empire has stopped covering some professional associations, and their members must now pay the individual rates, which are higher. \"Everybody has health insurance accessible to them,\" Mr. Cardone said. \"The problem is they can't all afford it.\" **********The reinsurance idea is being tested in Connecticut, where the pool will begin on May 1. Connecticut Blue Cross officials said the new law would actually force the association to start \"medical underwriting\" for the first time, to stay competitive. In medical underwriting, higher premiums are charged to those who have had expensive health problems. **********Mary Nell Lehnhard, a national Blue Cross vice president, said the Connecticut law might raise the cost of all health insurance. \"Twenty percent of the people enrolled tpically incur about 80 percent of the costs,\" she said. \"If costs for the 20 percent are reduced, they will have to be raised quickly for a lot of people, which could cause political problems.\" The issue is being debated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The group is drafting a model law, to be recommended to legislatures and regulators in the 50 states. **********In Congress, Pete Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he favored a bill that would restore tax exemption to Blue Cross plans that offer open enrollment and community rating. **********Only 21 of the 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans might qualify for tax exemption under the bill, which is sponsored by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. But the national Blue Cross supports it. The measure will probably be part of the next tax package. **********Mr. Stark is considering taking the Rangel approach a step further. Arguing that the industry's proposals for change would not reach enough of the 37 million uninsured Americans, Mr. Stark said he was thinking of requiring all insurers to offer open enrollment and community rating. The new rules would also apply to self-insured employers, who are exempt from many regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. **********Mr. Stark's plan was criticized by insurance industry spokesmen. \"Mr. Stark is in pursuit of a romantic ideal,\" said Mr. Schramm of the health insurance association. Health-cost inflation would \"jump to over 20 percent a year,\" he said, if rates could not be tied to medical histories. Bernard R. Tresnowski, president of national Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said, \"We've got to be able to take demographic factors into account, particularly age.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/07/business/businesses-plan-a-slim-3-rise-in-spending.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 372, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Businesses Plan a Slim 3% Rise in Spending", "print_headline": "Businesses Plan a Slim 3% Rise in Spending", "body_text": " **********Businesses in the United States plan to increase their investment spending by just 3 percent this year, the smallest rise in five years, the Government reported today. **********Analysts said the recession, in trimming consumer demand, had reduced available cash as well as any immediate need for new plants and equipment. **********The Commerce Department said that a survey conducted in April and May found businesses planning to spend $540.1 billion for expansion and modernization, up from a record $524.2 billion in 1990. **********Many analysts had expected capital spending to slow this year because of the recession. **********The Commerce Department said its survey showed that capital spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter after increasing six-tenths of 1 percent in the previous three months.

The plan called for an Israeli armed sweep through western Iraq by helicopter gunships and \"significant ground forces,\" including commando teams, all protected by Israeli Air Force planes that would have secured an air corridor through Jordan or Saudi Arabia to support the operation, the officials said. **********Their account provides the first detailed picture of how Israel planned to retaliate for the missile attacks that began with seven rockets on the second day of the war, and led to frantic consultations between American and Israeli leaders. Effort to Persuade Israel **********The intensity and scale of the military operations contemplated by Israel were the primary reasons President Bush and his senior advisers devoted a large amount of time in the first weeks of the air war to persuading Israel to avoid any military action that would threaten the anti-Iraq coalition and play into the hands of President Saddam Hussein by bringing Israel into the war. **********Israel's disclosure of its plan to conduct such a large operation may have prompted the brief discussion among Mr. Bush and his senior advisers, first alluded to in The Washington Post on Monday, about possibly going along with a limited retaliation plan in which Israel would fire a salvo of its Jericho medium-range ballistic missiles at Iraqi targets. But both plans were ultimately opposed by Washington. **********The ambitious Israeli plan for a air-ground operation, which would have been carried out over a number of days, was favored by Israeli military officials who argued that the United States could not guarantee the destruction of all mobile and fixed Scud missile sites in Iraq without inserting ground forces to search for and help destroy the missiles. Agreement Not to Retaliate **********United States officials familiar with the incursion plan described it as the kind of bold and dramatic operation that would have been possible with allied air superiority over Iraq. The plan also explains the great importance Israel attached to obtaining the American aircraft identity codes that would have allowed Israeli air forces to recognize as friend or foe any allied and Iraqi warplanes over Iraq. **********Administration officials said that in order to head off Israeli retaliation, they sent United States special operations forces into Western Iraq to help locate the mobile Scud launchers. **********United States officials believed they had Israel's tacit agreement not to retaliate for Scud attacks after President Bush discussed the Scud threat on Dec. 11 with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and assured him the United States war plan called for aggressive attacks on the Scud sites in Western Iraq. Administration officials said that tacit agreement was reaffirmed when Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger visited Israel in January, five days before the onset of the air war. **********But when Iraq launched the first seven modified Scud-B missiles against Tel Aviv and Haifa on Jan. 18, the tacit agreement was replaced by pressure to respond. The \"infrared signature\" of the Iraqi boosters were detected by the United States early warning satellites, which simulaneously transmitted the launching warning to the Pentagon, which in turn relayed the warning instantly over a newly established and secure hotline, called \"Hammer Rick,\" to Tel Aviv, officials said. Full-Scale Desert Assault **********United States intelligence also monitored Israel's initial response as it scrambled about a dozen jet fighters -- what one American official described as an \"intensive combat air patrol\" but not a \"strike package.\" **********Within hours of that launching, Defense Minister Moshe Arens was on the hotline to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who spent that evening at the White House fielding calls with Israeli leaders along with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Mr. Bush. **********Mr. Arens described the plan for a full-scale assault in the Iraqi desert to Mr. Cheney and requested United States military assistance for a full retaliatory raid. Administration officials said the Israeli plan called for flying air transports filled with Israeli troops through Jordan or Saudi Arabia to the Iraqi desert, where they would systematically attack the fixed Scud sites at Iraq's large H-2 and H-3 air bases. **********The Israeli helicopter and ground forces also would conduct search-and-destroy missions for mobile Scud launchers while Israeli warplanes flew strike and reconnaissance missions and held the skies over Western Iraq. 'We Need This Corridor' **********The plan called for Israeli aerial tankers to fly through Saudi Arabia or Jordan to support the air operations, including refueling the large attack helicopter fleet that would set up a temporary base in the Iraqi desert to support the ground forces and attack any challenge from the Iraqi Army, which maintained a large garrison in Western Iraq. **********The operation would have gone on for a number of days, Administration officials said, and would have required Israel's air force to maintain a large \"combat air patrol\" to secure the corridor through Saudi Arabia or Jordan. **********\"They laid out their idea and said, 'This is how we'd do it, and in order to do it, we need this corridor,\"' an Administration official said. **********Mr. Arens suggested that if the United States could not secure a corridor for Israeli forces through Saudi Arabia, Israel could seize such a corridor through Jordanian air space, destroying the American-supplied Hawk antiaircraft missile batteries that provide the bulk of Jordan's air defense. **********An administration official said Israel's request for an air corridor through Saudi Arabia was never conveyed to Saudi officials. **********With the promise of additional Patriot missile batteries, Mr. Bush and his senior aides were able to convince the Israelis not to execute any retaliation plan that night, but the threat of Israel's entry into the war did not immediately subside."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/business/ibm-rating-cut-by-duff-phelps.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

He called them \"deserters\" and said all of them should move back right away. **********\"He has no right,\" 34-year-old France Lebeenadan said after waiting more than an hour just to get inside the El Al office door for a booking to Paris. \"It's stupid. I'm not hysterical, but I feel a responsibility for my children.\" **********\"This is my country; I love my country,\" said Dali Saragossi, who was waiting to make bookings to New York for her two teen-age children. \"One of the missiles fell very near our house. It makes me very sad, but what are we to do? Their father lives in New York, and he wants them with him now.\"  'Trying to Find Cover' **********\"We're afraid,\" said her son David, who is 13. \"We don't want to die. We're just trying to find cover.\" **********As if to reinforce the boy's concerns, Iraq fired another missile with a conventional warhead at Tel Aviv tonight, the seventh attack in 12 days. But this time the army said the Scud was defective and disintegrated as it fell back to earth. No one was hurt, and there was no property damage. The missile had fallen apart even before any Patriot air-defense missiles could be fired at it. **********The Mayor's remarks, and those of other prominent Israelis who share his views, set off a broad round of national soul-searching about how Israelis should respond to the continuing missile threat: Are the people who stay in Tel Aviv brave, defiant Jews who are showing Saddam Hussein they can not be cowed? **********Or are they fools, willfully putting themselves and their children in mortal danger, even though they have a clear choice? **********For many people, memories of World War II lie just behind the immediate debate. The threat of attack with poisonous gas makes that memory seem even more relevant. And so several people quoted in the local press today said anyone who stays in Tel Aviv is being as shortsighted as the Jews who stayed in Germany in the late 1930's. **********But Mayor Lahat says he is only being practical.  'It Might Happen Here' **********\"Look, it's important to stay, and I want to be very clear about this issue,\" he said today. \"Yes, it's very dangerous to be in Tel Aviv. So people are leaving to other cities. Maybe tomorrow it will be dangerous in the whole country, and so they will leave the country. And I'm not speaking from a theoretical point of view. It might happen here.\" **********Aviva Marks, an actress who lives in Tel Aviv, agrees and draws her own comparison to World War II. **********\"The way that Hitler knew that if he could break London, he could win the war, well that's obviously Saddam's intention. Tel Aviv is the heart of the country. If Saddam Hussein thinks it's important enough to get us, then it's important enough for us to stay here.\" **********Still, tens of thousands leave the city each night, clogging the highways as they move to hotels in Jerusalem, Beersheba or Eilat.  'People Under Stress' **********\"We have about 100 rooms filled\" with people from Tel Aviv, said Omri Krongold, deputy manager of Jerusalem's Sheraton-Plaza Hotel. \"They're not tourists. They're people under stress. It's very strange to work with them. They don't go to the restaurants. Ninety percent stay in the hotel. They stay in their rooms and watch TV.\" **********Others leave Israel altogether. At the El Al office, a spokesman for the airline, Nachman Kleiman, said: \"We're not in a panic, but we've added flights, and we're using bigger planes.\" El Al is now the only airline regularly flying in and out of Israel, and it carried 3,200 people away on Sunday. **********\"There's a waiting list for every flight,\" Mr. Kleiman added. In fact, callers asking for a booking to New York today were told there were no seats available before Feb. 10. **********Tonight, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir weighed in with his own opinion about that. **********\"I wouldn't put on trial those who move from one city to another in Israel,\" he said. \"There's no shame in that. But I would of course condemn those who leave the country.\" **********Asa Kasher, a professor of philosophy at Tel Aviv University, represents a large body of public opinion when he says he is staying in town but doesn't blame anyone who chooses to leave.  'My Personal Decision' **********\"I think it is a matter of personal decision,\" he said. \"It is my personal decision to stay. I am a full-fledged Israeli, born here, raised here and everything of importance to me in my life happened to me here, and I'm not going to turn myself into a refugee under any condition. **********\"On the other hand,\" he added, \"it is a personal decision and I can understand if everyone else does something else. A mayor is in no position to give advice on matters of life and death to citizens.\" **********Gideon Samet, a columnist in the daily newspaper Haaretz, ridiculed the Mayor's notion that a sense of national duty should compel people to remain in town. **********\"It won't take much now so that soon there's a 'revolutionary guard' that will start patrolling Tel Aviv's streets,\" he wrote. \"They'll hang lists on tree trunks of those who've left.\"  Aftermath of Attack **********But the larger philosophical arguments were irrelevant to many of the people standing in line at the El Al office. Like most everyone else in the country, they watched television last Tuesday night, just after missiles killed one person and wounded more than 50 in Tel Aviv. **********Just after the attack, the fifth one to come at night, a young mother was filmed, sobbing as she stood before her ruined home, telling the television reporter that when the air raid sirens had sounded, her baby daughter had told her: \"'Mommy, don't die. Wait, so I can die with you.\"' **********This afternoon, a woman interviewed by Israeli television outside the El Al office said she was leaving for Canada \"because we are afraid. Aren't you afraid?\" **********But look around, the television reporter responded. It looks safe here in town now. **********\"Now, yes -- during the daytime,\" she answered. \"But what about at night?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/19/business/equity-issues-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Issues This Week", "print_headline": "Equity Issues This Week", "body_text": " **********BMC West Corp., 1.9 million common shares.

Worn-out blue trousers and jackets that seemed to come from another ideology and era litter the back alleys after they are dumped there by Albanians who receive new slacks or sweaters. **********In front of one school, a local Italian woman stood at the locked gate begging a guard to allow an Albanian family with one child to spend the night there. \"We want to help, but everything is so disorganized,\" she said. **********On another corner, a group of young Albanians from the port of Durres, from which most of the ships have left, talked of their 40-hour crossing on a boat someone had commandeered by pointing a pistol at the captain's head.

But the announcement was so short on details that it raised more questions than it answered about the value of lower Manhattan office buildings. **********Now, after an examination of the deal in the six weeks since it was announced, the terms of the transaction and the condition of the downtown office market confirm what many property analysts are saying: that there has been a severe and permanent loss of value in the downtown Manhattan office market, particularly among prewar and early postwar buildings. **********The Olympia & York deal involves 60 Broad Street, a 30-story, one-million-square-foot tower in the heart of the financial district owned by an Olympia & York partnership. In late October, Olympia & York announced that the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing had purchased the building's mortgage from CalFed Inc., a Los Angeles savings and loan, for about $57.5 million. **********The seven-year-old mortgage had originally been $160 million, but after the building's major tennant, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., went bankrupt last year and left the building more than 70 percent vacant, CalFed reassessed the building and wrote the mortgage down to $70 million. **********CalFed, through Jeffrey H. Lyndford, an executive of Wellsford, a California real estate company, and Banque Indosuez of France, contacted Mr. Li, who agreed to pay $57.5 million, forcing CalFed to take another write-down. **********The sharp revaluations of the mortgage indicated at the time the degree of collapse in the value of downtown Manhattan office space, particularly buildings like 60 Broad, put up immediately after World War II or earlier, and now short of income and tennants. **********As part of the deal, Mr. Li acquired 49 percent of the Olympia & York partnership that owned the building. That partnership, Olympia & York executives said at the time, would invest $60 million in the property for asbestos removal and renovations. Olympia & York has said it will provide the partnership with the $60 million, but it is unclear whether Mr. Li will lend Olympia & York any of the money. **********And it remains unknown what Mr. Li paid for his 49 percent interest in the partnership because he has already recouped the $57.5 million he spent to buy the mortgage from CalFed by placing the mortgage, which had a floating rate of return, with another company that has recourse to Olympia & York, which has guaranteed the loan. Mr. Li's return on the deal is really based on how much 60 Broad appreciates. **********Olympia & York executives have suggested that the value of the building could be put in the $117.5 million range, considering the mortgage purchase price and the $60 million in new capital for renovation and asbestos removal. **********\"We believe that the value of 60 Broad Street is substantial and that that value will be clearly demonstrated upon the completion of the redevelopment program,\" said John E. Zuccotti, president of Olympia & York U.S.A. **********But few real estate executives in New York believe that 60 Broad is now worth anything near $117.5 million. It may be worth slightly more than the $57.5 million paid for the mortgage, but before the asbestos removal and renovations, it is not worth much more. And the $60 million contribution for asbestos removal and renovation will be provided over several years, they say, and should not be added to the value of the building as a lump sum. **********In addition, there is a vacancy rate of 26 percent for downtown office buildings built just after World War II, according to Edward S. Gordon Inc., a leading New York property broker. That represents 3.8 million square feet of empty space in a total of 26 buildings. For the prewar buildings, the vacancy rate is even higher, and within the last 10 years, more than 20 million square feet of more modern, efficient space has been added downtown. **********For top-grade space downtown, net rents have fallen to about $9 a square foot from about $15 two years ago, while real estate taxes have risen. **********One widely known property executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that even after significant cosmetic upgrading and asbestos removal, rents at 60 Broad would not be low enough to compete with newer buildings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/05/world/confrontation-gulf-europe-offers-plan-encourage-iraq-s-withdrawal-kuwait.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1991-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1038, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Offers Plan to Encourage Iraq's Withdrawal From Kuwait", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Europe Offers Plan to Encourage Iraq's Withdrawal From Kuwait", "body_text": " **********In a move to encourage Iraq to pull its troops out of Kuwait, the 12-nation European Community promised Baghdad today that it would work to resolve all problems of the Middle East if the gulf crisis could be settled peacefully. **********At an emergency meeting here, foreign ministers of the community nations said \"Iraq should receive the assurance not to be subject to a military intervention\" once it had carried out United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding its withdrawal from Kuwait. **********Welcoming the announcement today that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, would meet in Geneva on Wednesday, the community further invited Mr. Aziz to visit Luxembourg on Thursday for talks with three European foreign ministers.  No Comment on European Plan **********The European Community meeting was interrupted by the news that Iraq had accepted the American offer of talks, a move that President Bush, speaking in Washington, described as a \"useful step.\" But Mr. Bush insisted that the meeting would be used solely to inform the Iraqis that they have to get out of Kuwait or face war. Questioned on the European plan, the President said he had not had a chance to study it and would not comment until he did, but he declined to rule out the terms of the plan.

They also stressed repeatedly that they remained in full agreement with the United States on the crisis. **********But while insisting in their statement that there could be no linkage between settlement of the crisis and other problems, it was apparent today that several governments, France and Germany among them, were eager to find some face-saving formula to encourage Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. **********France and Germany called the meeting today in the hope of keeping alive diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis after Washington and Baghdad appeared unable to agree on a date for direct talks. They also favored separate community talks with Baghdad if the United States-Iraqi talks fell through. **********But Britain and the Netherlands feared that an independent community initiative could be misread by Baghdad as evidence of a weakening in the broad anti-Iraqi coalition and seemed determined to block any meeting with Mr. Aziz unless he held talks with Mr. Baker first. **********European officials said that a potentially embarrassing rift in the community was avoided halfway through the closed-door session today when word came that Mr. Aziz had agreed to travel to Geneva next week for talks with Mr. Baker. **********\"There was an audible sigh of relief,\" an official said. **********Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting because it reaffirmed the community's unity. **********\"We are anxious for peace, anxious to go on searching for a peaceful solution,\" he said. \"But this can only come through a reversal of the aggression.\" **********He said that if Mr. Aziz accepted the invitation to talks with the community he would be given a double message. **********\"If Iraq does not comply with U.N. resolutions, it will be forced out of Kuwait,\" he said. \"If it fully and unconditionally withdraws, it will not be attacked.\" **********Asked whether Iraq was still required to leave by Jan. 15, Mr. Hurd said that \"obviously an element of practical common sense is involved, with the decision of member states depending on the situation prevailing at the time.\" **********Significantly, in a meeting with reporters, Mr. Hurd seemed to echo Washington's more cautious line by not emphasizing the community's offer to help establish \"security, stability and development\" in the Middle East if Iraq leaves Kuwait. **********But other foreign ministers emphasized that intention, including Mr. Poos, who said he was ready to discuss the \"after-crisis scenario\" with Mr. Aziz. \"The community demonstrated that it is not scared of a dialogue with the person responsible for the crisis,\" he said. **********If the Iraqi Foreign Minister comes to Luxembourg on Thursday, he will meet with Mr. Poos, as the current President of the Council of Ministers, as well as Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, who last held the post, and the Netherlands' Foreign Minister, Hans van den Broek, who takes over the position on July 1. **********At the start of today's session, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France proposed a seven-point plan that served as the basis for today's final statement, including the pledge that Iraq would not be attacked if it withdrew, the community's commitment to tackle other Middle East issues and an invitation to Mr. Aziz. **********The plan, immediately endorsed by Germany and Italy, also welcomed President Bush's new effort Thursday to organize a meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz and stressed that there was \"neither contradiction nor interference\" between the American and European initiatives. **********In a news conference in Paris today, President Francois Mitterrand nonetheless seemed to distance himself from the Bush Administration's recent warnings of an imminent war by suggesting a new meeting of the United Nations Security Council before any military offensive was started against Iraq. He said he would hold talks with Mr. Baker in Paris on Tuesday before the Secretary of State traveled to Geneva for his meeting with Mr. Aziz. **********Mr. Mitterrand also reiterated his call for international conferences to deal with critical Middle East problems and said France would not go beyond the objectives defined by the United Nations. **********\"I do not favor preventive war,\" he said when asked about the need to destroy Iraq's war capacity. \"France does not consider itself the world's policeman.\" **********Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who in recent days has strongly urged new diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis, told his community colleagues that \"war is not inevitable\" and warned of the dire consequences a war would have for the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/30/world/bangkok-journal-thailand-coup-casts-up-a-most-reluctant-premier.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1991-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bangkok Journal; Thailand Coup Casts Up a Most Reluctant Premier", "print_headline": "Bangkok Journal; Thailand Coup Casts Up a Most Reluctant Premier", "body_text": " **********Anand Panyarachun must be one of the world's most ambivalent leaders. His appointment as Thailand's interim Prime Minister is \"the biggest accident in Thai history,\" he says, and he is eager to finish his work, promote new elections and be gone from a post he never wanted in the first place. **********Two months after a military coup, Thais feel secure enough to grumble more loudly about the country's affairs, but Mr. Anand, 58 years old, is not normally the target. He is usually greeted with deference and pleasure, which makes him uncomfortable. **********A worldly figure, he is credited with attracting an experienced Cabinet and exercising a moderating influence on the both the tone and the policy of Thailand's military rulers. **********He and his Cabinet are running the country in partnership with the military until a new Constitution is written and new elections take place. Under an interim Constitution, elections must be held by April 30, 1992; Mr. Anand wants them sooner. If they are later, he said recently, he would resign.  A Politician 'by Chance' **********Mr. Anand, a former Ambassador to the United States and delegate to the United Nations, left diplomacy for business after an earlier generation of coup leaders accused him of Communism. He has become a politician now, he said in an interview, \"not by choice, but by chance.\" **********When told that many people were surprised he accepted the job from the military, Mr. Anand laughed and said, \"So was I.\" Twirling his hands above the lap of an elegantly cut gray suit, he said, \"I must have had a temporary lapse of mental awareness,\" and then he laughed again. **********The coup, which took place on Feb. 23, was much-rumored but still unexpected, because most Thais thought coups outdated in a more democratic age. The ousted Prime Minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, was the first directly elected leader since 1976, and he had a solid parliamentary majority. **********But politics and business were thoroughly and visibly intertwined, and many Thais grew tired of Mr. Chatichai's \"no problem\" response to criticism. The military felt its own considerable interests under threat.  Thais 'Got Carried Away' **********Thais were wrong to think the generals would do nothing, Mr. Anand said. \"In a way, the Thai people got carried away by this total freedom of expression, by this illusion that there was a political or civilian control over the armed forces,\" he said. \"When a country that has gone through decades, centuries of a predominant military role in the ruling of country, you can't just throw them out. They have face, too.\" **********Political control over the military is still \"an essence of a democracy,\" he said. \"But it must be evolutionary. You can't just impose it. It must be agreed to by the military.\" You have to start with confidence-building measures, he said. \"If one side feels manipulated by the other, that's where the conflict arises.\"  The Ultimate Goal **********Some Thais suggest it is Mr. Anand who is being manipulated by the military, to give the coup an acceptable face, especially to the West. \"I haven't lived up until this year in order to be manipulated,\" he said with some heat. **********He waited a moment, then said, \"Every politician, every political leader, even in a fully democratic society, must always be manipulated by circumstances.\" **********And it so happens in Thailand the military is a factor that must be reckoned with. In other countries it is trade unions, or newspapers, or intellectuals, or the new left or the old right.\" **********Angry now, he said: \"Would they like me to be completely independent? So that I can be a real live dictator?\" When it was suggested that some Thais thought he would be preferable to others they could think of, he laughed again. **********The ultimate goal, he said, \"is still to achieve a fully democratic regime.\" But democracy requires evolution and cannot be put into place overnight. \"In the past, we've often been preoccupied with the form, rather than the substance of democracy,\" he said. Adequate political participation is still lacking; so is a full understanding of democratic \"rights and responsibilities,\" which is not just a matter of constitutions. **********\"Government of the people, by the people and for the people -- it's easier said than done,\" Mr. Anand said. \"If we want to have democratic rule, we have to earn it.\" **********It is obvious Mr. Anand has his misgivings, especially over the continuation of martial law, which he says will be lifted early in May. He also seems uncomfortable over some abrupt policy changes the military has pushed through the National Assembly, like the recent dissolution of trade unions at state enterprises. Martial law prevents demonstrations against the new law, but it is not unpopular among many Thais, who regard state workers as highly privileged. **********The military also wants to end the common practice of vote-buying and thinks that can be accomplished by a complete separation of the executive and legislative branches. But for Mr. Anand, vote buying \"is merely a symptom of the national system, which is cancerous.\" There is a \"total malady of the society,\" he said, rooted in greed and distorted social values. **********\"It's part of corruption and corrupt practices,\" he said. \"It goes into the Civil Service system, where many are quite capable but not paid enough; it goes into business practices; it goes into every sector. **********\"Of course,\" he added bitingly, \"if the top leadership does not set a good example, there is no constraint.\"  Much to Be Done **********In his short time in office, he said, there is much that can be done to improve the tax system; to toughen penalties against narcotics trafficking, which would gratify Washington, since much of the heroin in America is shipped through Bangkok; to improve the commercial code, and to begin to deal with Thailand's AIDS epidemic through better education. He also wants to defuse a battle with Washington over Thai abuses of intellectual property, with widespread copying of music, videos, software and prescription drugs. **********By 1976, Mr. Anand had risen to the top Civil Service post in the Foreign Ministry, under Mr. Chatichai. After the fall of South Vietnam, he helped negotiate a withdrawal of American forces from Thailand and better relations with Indochina. But after a military coup, he was accused of being a Communist and transferred to an inactive post. **********He was later reinstated, but shipped off to Bonn as Ambassador. He resigned and went into business in 1979, and says he was very surprised when the army commander, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, a junior military attache in Mr. Anand's Washington Embassy in 1972, asked him to become Prime Minister. **********\"I had quite a few concerns in my mind,\" Mr. Anand said, \"particularly since I hardly knew them, and they hardly knew me.\" But General Suchinda's answers were \"sincere,\" Mr. Anand said. Still, when the time limit on his tenure was mentioned, he broke in to say, \"Thank God.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/11/business/maryland-prices-100-million-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maryland Prices $100 Million Bonds", "print_headline": "Maryland Prices $100 Million Bonds", "body_text": " **********The State of Maryland priced $100 million in tax-exempt general obligation bonds yesterday through competitive bidding.

But in the last few years, vintners have been making a less visible commitment to Bacchus: new caves for the gentle aging of their fine wines. **********Wines age best at a constant, relatively low temperature, particularly while they are in oak barrels before bottling. The insulating properties of tons of earth and stone make caves a wonderfully low-technology alternative to the elaborate air-conditioning needed for above-ground storage. **********Some of the oldest California wineries, like Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena and the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, have caves dating to the 19th century, which were dug by Chinese coolies with picks and shovels. But nearly all of the new caves in Napa and Sonoma are the work of Alf Burtleson and his four-man crew, who battle the local geology with a 22-foot-long electric and hydraulic drill made by Hawker Siddeley in England for digging coal mines. **********Trained as a civil engineer, Mr. Burtleson specialized in utility tunnels until he was hired to dig a small wine cave in the hill behind Far Niente in 1979. Since then, the Burtleson Construction Company has completed 22 caves in Napa and Sonoma counties; the company dropped the public works projects in 1986 to concentrate on wine caves. **********Among those completed most recently are 20,000 square feet of caves at Clos Pegase. These were particularly challenging -- first because the rock was soft and crumbly and second because Jan Schrem, the owner of Clos Pegase, wanted the caves to serve as extended galleries for his art collection. **********Mr. Burtleson's crew can mine three feet an hour in hard homogeneous rock, but the workers must proceed more slowly in soft rock, stopping frequently to apply steel mesh and concrete to reinforce the new cave. At each step, the arched shape of the tunnel must be maintained. \"We can't let it ever cave in,\" said Mr. Burtleson. \"Once you lose the arch, you've lost it all.\" **********To display the works of art, small alcoves were carved, and a large open room was mined for slide shows and other gatherings. While a simple tunnel can be left as bare rock with no reinforcement, open rooms require multiple passes with the drilling machine, multiple layers of mesh and concrete and steel rock bolts drilled into the walls. **********Despite the obvious attention to esthetics, the caves at Clos Pegase have very real practical benefits, both in the bottle and on the bottom line, said Bill Pease, Clos Pegase's wine maker. In an air-conditioned warehouse, the air moves at great speed, accelerating evaporation of wine from the barrels. And because most air-conditioning dehumidifies, water evaporates, increasing the wine's alcohol content, he said. Since many California wines start with relatively high alcohol levels, this is a problem. In caves, the opposite happens; the alcohol is evaporated, dropping as much as two-tenths of 1 percent in a year. \"That sounds trivial, but the human palate is sensitive to these things,\" Mr. Pease said. **********He noted that the slower evaporation in a cave saves the winery money, but the biggest saving is in energy cost. \"A constant 62 degrees without having to turn on refrigeration compressors is a steal,\" he said. **********Then too, caves are relatively free from Napa Valley's stringent land-use rules. \"In many cases, it's going to be the only alternative if you need more space because in Napa County God help you if you want to add a building,\" Mr. Pease said. **********In terms of cost, building a cave is competitive with above-ground construction, and any premium is rapidly recouped in savings on energy expenses, Mr. Burtleson said. Many of his projects have been completed for less than $50 a square foot. But as caves come to be vintners' status symbols as well as simple storage facilities, elaborate features can drive the price much higher. A recent 15,000-square-foot addition to the original small cave at Far Niente came in at $100 a square foot, or a total of about $1.5 million. **********Esthetic concerns were an integral part of the design, with recessed lighting, back-lit niches and a large octagonal library room. **********\"Caves have esthetics impossible to capture in an above-ground building,\" said Dirk Hampson, Far Niente's wine maker. \"They seem to touch people on an emotional level.\" **********One novel feature at Far Niente is side tunnels cut at 45 degrees rather than at right angles. \"When you walk people through a cave at a different angle, they almost always lose their sense of direction,\" said Mr. Hampson. \"It makes caves seem much larger and more mysterious.\" **********Perhaps attracted by the waiting list for Mr. Burtleson's services, other construction companies are beginning to get into the cave-construction business. Even so, Mr. Burtleson declines to add a second crew because he does not believe he can adequately oversee two. \"Caves are not like regular construction; you can't come back and change it after the fact,\" he said. **********Meanwhile, not everybody believes caves are the best place to store aging wine, at least not in the Napa Valley. **********Andre Tchelistcheff, the dean of California wine makers and a consultant to Beaulieu Vineyards and Buena Vista Winery, said conditions here are very different from those at the famous Champagne caves of France. The French caves are very deep, in granite and remain quite cold. In light of Napa's proximity to the hot springs of Calistoga, \"our stone structures are warm, so the temperature in our tunnels is a little bit above optimal,\" he said. **********The warmth and moisture also foster mold, which produces a smell that could infiltrate the wine through the barrels, Mr. Tchelistcheff said. \"I prefer to build my storage above ground and have control over the atmospheric conditions.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/01/business/treasury-to-auction-only-bills-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury to Auction Only Bills This Week", "print_headline": "Treasury to Auction Only Bills This Week", "body_text": " **********The tentative schedule of Treasury financings for this week is confined to the bill market, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

Today, he also rejected any rush to dispatch immediate humanitarian aid, like food and food-distribution teams.

Events there are moving at a most astonishing pace.\" **********But the British Prime Minister is said by associates to favor a sizable program of food shipments to the Soviet Union, considerably expanded programs of technical assistance and urgent measures to bring Moscow into the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions. **********In each case, he favors a slightly more aggressive policy than Mr. Bush, but he is much more restrained than most of the continental Europeans. **********Talking with reporters today before playing golf, Mr. Bush said he had not yet considered the question of food aid. He said \"we want to do our part on that,\" but called for more study before any decisions are made. **********\"It has to be an orderly process,\" the President said. \"You don't just go click off a decision.\" Concern Among Europeans **********The Netherlands, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Community, reportedly supports the British position. But France, Germany and Italy, the diplomats said, are ready to fight hard for direct financial support, and there is no assurance that the differences can be papered over. **********The representatives of the leaders of the Group of Seven are to meet in London on Thursday to try to do so, but Mr. Major reportedly warned American officials that success could not be guaranteed, especially as President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany have publicly committed themselves to the notion that more money must be sent quickly to insure that democracy prevails. **********Indeed, both have suggested that the failure of the Group of Seven to act boldly in London may have contributed to the attempted coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, an idea that Washington rejects and ridicules. **********Germany fears anarchy in the Soviet Union perhaps more than any other country, because it could send Soviet refugees flooding into German territory and make it impossible for the 275,000 Soviet troops still in Germany to go home as scheduled. France holds similar views, and together the two big continental powers may be able to bring smaller countries along with them. **********Japan has sided so far with the United States, but there is widespread speculation that if Mr. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly powerful President of the Russian republic, were to agree to cede the Kurile Islands to Japan, as Japan has long asked, Tokyo might make a major aid commitment. **********Canada has also backed Mr. Bush on aid, although Prime Minister Brian Mulroney not only decided to recognize the independence of the Baltic states before the President was ready to do so but also announced his decision at a news conference with Mr. Bush in Kennebunkport this week. **********Mr. Major met Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger during his brief stop in Washington. He reportedly told them that he had no intention of trying to call an immediate meeting of the Group of Seven leaders to discuss the impasse on aid. **********If agreement proves impossible, British officials and others said, Mr. Major will have several options. He might suggest that each member of the Group of Seven follow its own instincts, but that would displease the Germans, who feel they have already carried a disproportionate share of the burden of helping the Soviet Union. **********He might suggest that the issue be bucked to some other organization, like the United Nations.

The lanky, 50-year-old sounds almost apologetic that Disney took so long to enter a market that has 120 million more people than the United States in half the land mass. **********Euro Disneyland will come complete with a golf course, a Davy Crockett campground, an ice-skating rink inspired by Rockefeller Center's and six Disney-owned hotels with 5,200 rooms. But Disney's ambitions do not stop there. The company is planning a $3 billion second phase, with a Disney MGM studio and visitors' tour to open in 1994 as well as 13,000 more hotel rooms. It is also weighing a European Epcot. **********\"There is tremendous future growth for our company in Europe,\" Mr. Eisner said in a telephone interview. **********One of the reasons Mr. Eisner is so confident is that Europeans love Disney's American parks; they accounted for 2.7 million visits last year. And they love the Mickey magazines and T-shirts, Little Mermaid records and other Disney paraphernalia, so much that they spent $1.6 billion on Disney merchandise last year. **********Mr. Eisner is so keen on Europe that Disney has taken a 49 percent stake in the Euro Disney project, the maximum the French Government will allow. In contrast, Disney took no ownership interest in Tokyo Disneyland, opting instead for licensing fees and a percentage of revenues. At the time, much of Disney's money was tied up in building Epcot Center in Florida. The company also worried about the special risks of the Tokyo venture, the first non-American and first cold-weather Disneyland. The worries turned out to be misplaced: Tokyo became a smashing success. **********Missing the ownership boat in Tokyo \"was a big mistake which they didn't want to repeat,\" said Salomon's Ms. Vignola. With Disney's domestic growth slowing, she added, \"for the near term, Europe will be the primary engine of growth.\" **********The move has already paid off on paper. Disney spent about $1.90 for each of its 86 million shares in Euro Disney; Euro Disney shares now sell for about $22. **********Once the park opens, the real payoff begins. The company will receive 10 percent of Euro Disney's admission fees and 5 percent of food and merchandise revenues, the same arrangement as in Japan. But in France, it will also receive management fees, incentive fees and 49 percent of the profits. **********Based on current projections, that will amount to a $64 million contribution to Disney profits in the fiscal year ending September 1993, $101 million for 1994 and $199 million for 1995, according to Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch analyst. In fiscal 1990, Disney earned $824 million on revenues of $5.84 billion. **********What makes the European numbers even sweeter is that Disney has put up only $160 million for the project. Other investors have pumped in $1.2 billion in equity, the French Government has provided a low-interest $960 million loan and banks have lent another $1.6 billion. The rest -- some $400 million -- comes from special partnerships formed to buy properties and lease them back. **********\"This financing arrangement has been possible because Disney has a solid track record,\" crows John Forsgren, Euro Disney's chief financial officer, expressing a view that analysts do not dispute.  The French Connection **********Disney executives chose the beet fields of the Marne-la-Vallee area outside Paris after examining 200 locations in Europe. Disney loved being near Paris, Europe's biggest magnet for tourism. And France was eager to win the project to help lower its high jobless rate and to fuel its efforts to be the nerve center of Europe. **********\"Euro Disney is going to create at least 30,000 jobs,\" said Christian Cardon, who heads a Government office set up to make things easier for Disney. \"And tourists from abroad will spend almost $1 billion a year here.\" **********In addition to providing a huge loan at subsidized rates, the Government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on subway and other capital improvements related to the park. Through Euro Disney, France seems to be trying to shed its image as a country where bureaucrats reign supreme and foreign investment is unwelcome. **********The other finalist for the park was Barcelona, which had warmer weather but was rejected because its transportation system was not as good as the one in Paris and because it lacked large, flat tracts of land. **********Disney executives also liked the central location of the French site. \"France is the crossroads of Europe,\" Mr. Eisner said. Seventeen million people live within a two-hour drive of Euro Disney -- 109 million live within six hours.  Extending the Line **********To help get people to the park, the Government is extending Paris's express subway out to Euro Disney; the 35-minute ride from downtown will cost about $2.50. The Government is also building a station for the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse just 150 yards from the entrance gate. Mickey-lovers will be able to arrive from Brussels in 90 minutes, and from London in three hours and 10 minutes once the tunnel under the English Channel opens in 1993. **********Euro Disney is Europe's second-largest construction project after the tunnel, which is plagued by delays and cost overruns. \"There is a big difference between Euro Disney and Eurotunnel,\" said Robert Miller-Bakewell, an analyst with County Natwest-Wood MacKenzie, a London brokerage. \"Euro Disney is very much on time and looks to be on budget.\" **********Eurotunnel is hostage to one contractor, while Euro Disney has hired 37 so that if one has cost overruns or falls behind, it can easily be dropped. **********Jim Cora, an executive vice president who is the hands-on manager of the construction, spent two years after Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 studying how that park's construction could have been improved. Armed with that sort of experience, Disney set such exacting demands on the French that construction companies howled -- before signing right up. **********One thing Mr. Cora learned in Tokyo was the need to do more to protect visitors from problems not usually associated with Disneyland in Anaheim and Disney World in Orlando: wind, rain and cold. Thus Euro Disney's ticket booths will be protected from the elements, as will the waiting areas for attractions and the moving sidewalks from the 12,000-space parking lot. **********\"If Tokyo had not taught us that Disney parks are weatherproof, we might have chosen to go to Spain because of the warmer climate,\" said the French-speaking Mr. Fitzpatrick, who studied medieval French literature in graduate school at Johns Hopkins, and married a Frenchwoman. He was president of the California Institute of the Arts before moving to Euro Disney, where part of his role is to serve as Disney's ambassador to France. To the intellectuals who snicker at Disney, he says there is no reason why the French cannot love opera, the Louvre and Mickey, too. **********In fact, while Euro Disneyland will be similar to its American counterparts, Disney's \"imagineers\" have not forgotten to add some French accents -- and some British, Italian and German ones as well. The park will have two official languages, English and French, and multilingual guides on hand to help Dutch, German, Spanish and Italian visitors. **********Among the attractions with a local spin will be Discoveryland, inspired by the science fiction of France's Jules Verne, and a theater with a 360-degree screen featuring a movie that spans European history. Snow White will speak German, and the Belle Notte Pizzeria and Pasticceria will be next door to Pinocchio.  'Politically Astute' **********\"Europe isn't North America,\" said Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose office is dominated by a seven-foot-tall Mickey Mouse tapestry. \"It seemed appropriate and politically astute to underline that Pinocchio was an Italian boy, Peter Pan used to fly out of London and Cinderella was a French girl. We've tried to re-emphasize the European roots of these stories.\" **********Still, the new Disneyland will remain far more American than European. \"It would have been silly to take Mickey Mouse and try to do surgery to create a transmogrified hybrid, half French and half American,\" Mr. Fitzpatrick said. **********Euro Disney will borrow many attractions from its American siblings.  There will be Michael Jackson's 3-D movie, \"Captain EO,\" as well as Star Tours, the George Lucas-inspired simulator that catapults visitors into space. There will also be Main Street U.S.A., with nickelodeons and ice-cream parlors, and Frontierland with gun-slinging cowboys. Buccaneers will cross swords in Pirates of the Caribbean -- speaking Spanish, Dutch and French as well as English, just like pirates of yore. **********And Disney has had the audacity to banish wine (and other alcoholic beverages) from France's Magic Kingdom, just as in its other parks. **********\"To the untrained eye, this Magic Kingdom will be very similar to Tokyo Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom in Florida,\" said Mr. Eisner. **********Can the mix of American and European influences attract -- and hold -- an audience? No question, says Mr. Fitzpatrick, who adds that his real concern is that too many people will come at peak times, forcing Euro Disney to shut its gates after its 50,000-person capacity is reached.  Bigger Crowds Yet **********After all, Disney executives say, the attendance target of 11 million could well be a conservative number. Disney parks in the United States, which has a population of 250 million, attract about 41 million visitors a year, according to Amusement Business Magazine, a Nashville publication. If Disney fans in Western Europe, with its 370 million people, visit the new park at the same rate, attendance would reach 60 million. **********Mr. Fitzpatrick adds that attendance can only be helped by the five-week vacations that the French and Germans typically receive, compared with the average of two to three weeks in the United States. The French are expected to account for 55 percent of visitors, Germans 14 percent and the British, 8 percent. **********Euro Disney will thrive, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, despite the failures of other French parks. That's because there is only one Disney. **********\"We are spending 22 billion French francs before we open the door, while the other places spent 700 million,\" he said. \"This means we can pay infinitely more attention to details -- to costumes, hotels, shops, trash baskets -- to create a fantastic place. There's just too great a response to Disney for us to fail.\"  THE HOTEL DIMENSION **********Euro Disney's six hotels, which aim to give Europeans a taste of America, underline how Disney is increasingly becoming a real estate development and hotel management company. Disney executives say that if the hotels do as well as expected, they might be sold for a hefty capital gain. They will cost more than $1 billion to build. **********For the first time at a Disney park, a hotel will be right at the entrance gate. It's Magic Kingdom, a Victorian palace, looking out on Main Street U.S.A. **********Among the others: *********** The Hotel New York, with towers that look borrowed from Central Park West. *********** The Newport Bay Club, painted a cool New England blue, on a lake with a lighthouse and a 70-yard observation deck filled with rocking chairs. *********** The Hotel Cheyenne, inspired by Western frontier towns. **********The architects include such luminaries as Michael Graves and Robert A. M. Stern. **********As American as the hotels are, they owe one touch to a cold, rainy day in Paris. That day, Robert Fitzpatrick, chairman of Euro Disney, and Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, stepped into the luxurious Hotel La Tremoille, where Mr. Eisner was warmed and heartened by the wood-burning fireplace. **********Then and there, Mr. Fitzpatrick recalled, Mr. Eisner decreed that Euro Disney's hotels should all have such homey fireplaces.  CINDERELLA HITS HER STRIDE IN TOKYO **********TOKYO -- The snack bars dispense hot dogs and hamburgers by the thousands, Cinderella bats her big blue eyes engagingly at the admiring throngs, and when the furry critters in the country bear jamboree open their mechanical mouths to entertain with hillbilly music, out pours -- Japanese. **********What the Japanese wanted in their version of Disneyland was a genuine American experience. What they got was a world that envelops visitors in not one, but two fantasies -- of a dreamy, simplified America, and of a land of flying elephants, talking mice and magical castles. **********And the Japanese owners of Tokyo Disneyland got a gold mine: Nearly 16 million visitors are expected in the fiscal year that ends March 31, leaving the squeaky-clean park and its five official hotels jammed year-round. **********Tokyo Disneyland opened somewhat inauspiciously eight years ago, on 201 acres of land in the eastern suburb of Urayasu. Like much in Japan, the choice of locations had a deep corporate meaning; it was intended to bolster the Keisei Electric Railway Company, which had become heavily indebted from property speculation and needed to sell some of its holdings. **********It was arranged that an entity called Oriental Land would build, own and operate the theme park, with advice from Walt Disney Productions. Oriental Land, owned by Keisei and Mitsui Real Estate, borrowed most of the $650 million needed to realize the fantasy. **********Disney receives 10 percent of the revenues from admission and rides and 5 percent on sales of food, drink and souvenirs. **********After a slow start, Japanese began flocking to the theme park, which serves almost no Japanese food and whose live entertainers are largely American. **********\"Cinderella has to be a Caucasian, we decided,\" said Toshiharu Akiba, the head of international public relations. **********Apologizing for the existence of the single Japanese restaurant inside the park, Mr. Akiba added, \"A lot of elderly Japanese came here from outlying parts of Japan, and they were not very familiar with hot dogs and hamburgers.\" **********In the year that ended last March 31, revenues reached $988 million, with ordinary profits at $150 million. **********Local governments have acquired a stake in the park to enjoy some of those profits. As of late last year, Chiba prefecture, in which Tokyo Disneyland is located, took a 5 percent stake in Oriental Land, and the town of Urayasu acquired a 1 percent share. -- JAMES STERNGOLD"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/business/us-pension-agency-seeks-914-million-from-pan-am.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1991-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Pension Agency Seeks $914 Million From Pan Am", "print_headline": "U.S. Pension Agency Seeks $914 Million From Pan Am", "body_text": " **********The Federal agency that insures pension plans went to bankruptcy court yesterday with claims for $914 million that it contended Pan American World Airways owes to three pension plans. **********The claims were filed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York where Pan Am's filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code is being litigated. **********James B.

Variety of Claims **********Most of the claims filed yesterday dealt with underfinancing of the pension plans by Pan Am, the Government said. It also said that Pan Am owed insurance premium payments to the agency. **********A bankruptcy court filing on the severance pay for Pan Am's three top officers was postponed yesterday and is expected to be made today. **********The three top officers are expected to get severance pay equal to two years' salary, according to a person familiar with the filing who did not want to be identified. **********Thomas G.

The amount left for creditors in a bankruptcy is often only a fraction of what they are owed. **********Mr. Lockhart said the Labor Department is pursuing an expedited appeal of the LTV ruling, made by Federal Judge Kevin Duffy.

Never mind that twice this year, the big Pittsburgh-based company has been forced to reconcile itself to huge losses from misguided loans by its Westinghouse Credit subsidiary for suburban hotels, motels, apartments and office buldings. Two weeks ago, it earmarked $1.68 billion as a reserve against additional loan losses, bringing to $2.66 billion its total addition to reserves this year. **********\"If the economy continues to be one in which real estate values continue to plummet and highly leveraged companies continue to have problems funding themselves, then they could have more problems,\" said Fred Pastore, a analyst at Moody's Investors Service who has been given access to the mountain of junk bonds and real estate loans in the Westinghouse Credit Corporation's portfolio.  Interest in the Pieces **********With a difficult financing road ahead, more problems could mean that Westinghouse will have to sell several of its non-core businesses and might be significantly changed in a restructuring. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the powerful New York leveraged buyout firm, is already reviewing some of Westinghouse's businesses. **********More than half the giant conglomerate's real estate loans, amounting to about $3 billion, are not paying all, or any, of the interest they are supposed to pay. Westinghouse Credit's real estate loss reserves equal about 68 percent of its underperforming real estate assets, but the company also has another $1.7 billion of off-balance-sheet credit commitments that it may have to finance if the market continues to trample its investments. **********\"We think they may need half a billion to a billion dollars more in reserves,\" said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with County NatWest. \"In order to solve the problem, they are going to have to put the bad loans in a separate, self-funding company.\" **********In an attempt to buttress the company's cash position and forestall more big losses, Paul E. Lego, Westinghouse's chairman, announced a plan to speed the recovery of the financial services group, which handles the real estate portfolio. **********Mr. Lego has replaced William A. Powe, 54 years old, the high-powered salesman who oversaw most of the failed property investments, with Leo W. Yochum, 64, the company's former chief financial officer, who is coming out of retirement. **********Mr. Lego, who declined to be interviewed, has also begun a financing plan that includes private placement of new equity, reduction of short-term debt and expansion of bank credit facilities. The company hopes to improve its cash flow by $500 million by the end of next year, in part by issuing $400 million in Westinghouse stock instead of cash to the company pension fund. Mr. Lego has refused to rule out the need for yet more loss reserves.  Overvalued Hotel Properties **********How did this corporate giant, better known for making complex electronic equipment, stumble so badly? **********Executives and analysts who have worked with Westinghouse or seen portions of its property portfolio said about 200 loans, or about a quarter of its portfolio, are in limited-service, franchised economy hotels like Hampton Inns, one of its largest borrowers, and Embassy Suites, Days Inn and some Marriott Courtyard motels. These loans, many of which went to small operators, were made on inflated appraisals in the late 1980's and too often represented a high portion of the appraised value, often between 75 percent and 95 percent. **********Sometimes developers who were looking to squeeze a little more cash out of their buildings would get a first mortgage for, say, 70 percent of the property from a bank or insurance company, and then go to Westinghouse Credit for a second mortgage secured by the additional 30 percent of value. **********In this depressed real estate market -- hotel property values have fallen by at least 30 percent in the last four years -- nearly all of Westinghouse's second mortgages have been wiped out, those familiar with Westinghouse's holdings said. Even many first mortgages are worth substantially less. **********Westinghouse Credit, along with the Japanese leasing companies, developed a reputation in the commercial real estate community as a lender of last resort: If you borrowed from them, you would have to pay higher loan fees, but they would make loans that banks would not make. **********In addition, credit companies can often close deals quicker because they are not subject to Government supervision as banks or insurance companies are. As a result, many of the big property syndicators and partnerships, like VMS Realty, the troubled Chicago real estate company, went to Westinghouse. **********\"All the credit companies got into the hotel business in the mid-80's, when they saw the great returns they could get and the real estate climbing in value,\" said Dan W. Daniele, director of hospitality consulting services for Ernst & Young. \"So they made five- to seven-year mini-perm loans and thought they could flip the hotels when the values rose. Now every credit company has a large portion of its underperforming assets that are hotels.\" **********All this has left Westinghouse Credit with a mountain of nonperforming mortgages secured by buildings that cannot, and will not for the forseeable future, support the debt. Meanwhile, its inventory of foreclosed real estate, valued at about $195 million in June, is rising as more developers walk away. **********\"Westinghouse viewed it as a business like making lightbulbs or any other business,\" said a real estate executive. \"It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that the reason they got such big fees was because the deals they were financing were incredibly risky.\" **********If the economy slows further, many of the hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgages that Westinghouse recently renegotiated to give borrowers more manageable terms may nevertheless become delinquent. **********\"They were high-value lenders,\" said a banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity, \"and their premise was that even if income were to go down, values would be sustained. But that didn't happen. Westinghouse underwrote income at very small margins, so if the income went down, they were in trouble.\" Need for More Financing **********Many people in the commercial property business said that Mr. Powe and the go-getters he assembled at Westinghouse Credit were aware of the risks but were counting on ever-increasing property values and Japanese and other willing foreign buyers. Now the Japanese have their own sour real estate investments to fret about, and Mr. Powe is out. **********And even assuming that Westinghouse is successful in its plans to raise $900 million, unknowns loom about the parent company's balance sheet, suggesting it will have a strong, continuing need for large amounts of bank financing. Even before the real estate reserves, the operating profits at the company's businesses were down 30 percent as of September. Last week, about 80 banks that lend to Westinghouse held preliminary discussions on the company's problems and near-term financial needs. **********Westinghouse has about $5 billion in short-term debt and commercial paper that will come due and need to be rolled over next year. The banks that will be asked to provide more credit will want to be certain that the company's liabilities and its real estate problems have been sufficiently provided for. **********Those liabilities include about $1 billion in unfinanced company pension fund charges, an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in environmental cleanup costs for some 57 sites and another estimated $500 million charge related to employee health-care benefits that must be addressed by Jan. 1, 1993. **********With a book value of about $3 billion plus another $900 million if the financing plan goes through, Westinghouse will be squeezed over the next year as some of these charges hit its bottom line. The net present value of the company is difficult to determine with these liabilies, but it seems clear that the banks will have to come to the rescue because the commercial paper market is effectively closed to Westinghouse. **********The company has had repeated downgradings of its credit ratings and has had trouble persuading investors that they should buy its commercial paper, the corporate i.o.u.'s that help manage its cash and liquidity. **********On top of that, Westinghouse Electric faces a class-action suit that contends the company failed to adequately disclose the extent of its real estate problems when it sold 21.5 million shares of common stock in May. At that time, Westinghouse traded at around $28 a share. On Friday, it closed at $16.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Nine-Month Loss **********Real estate woes were almost entirely responsible for Westinghouse Electric's $1.25 billion loss for the first nine months of this year on revenues of $9.37 billion. That compares with a net profit of $717 million, or $2.44 a share, on revenues of $9.21 billion for the comparable 1990 period. **********Mr. Heymann, the NatWest analyst, estimated that his previous worst-case prediction for the company's dividend -- that it would be cut in half, to 70 cents a share -- is now the best that can be expected. In fact, he and others believe the dividend may be temporarily eliminated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/rich-s-plans-to-close-its-main-store.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1991-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 521, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rich's Plans To Close Its Main Store", "print_headline": "Rich's Plans To Close Its Main Store", "body_text": " **********Rich's Inc., a landmark in downtown Atlanta for more than a century, announced yesterday that it would close the huge store on July 13 after five years of continuing losses. **********The announcement at 5 P.M. surprised the store staff, competitors and the public.

Pink Pigs and Easy Returns **********For decades, the store lighted a Christmas tree on Thanksgiving night and gave children rides through the store on a miniature train with cars shaped like pink pigs. It offered customers an extremely liberal policy on returns, and its closing will be felt far beyond the loss of sales. **********Judith Webb, a native of Atlanta and an employee of the Chamber of Commerce, said: \"I got my wedding dress at Rich's; I got my first prom dress at Rich's.

But sales at the downtown store represent only 3.7 percent of Rich's total 1990 sales of $824 million. **********In 1988, Federated merged its Goldsmith stores into Rich's and a headquarters staff was maintained for the combined group in the downtown Atlanta store.

Other pastimes included: being with the family, travel, music, computer hacking and fishing (all 4 percent); woodworking and gardening (3 percent each), and sex (1 percent). **********So, without drawing any conclusions from the data, here are some suggestions for reading material and gifts. **********\"Cyberspace: First Steps\" ($24.95, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Boston) is an anthology of essays and musings on one of the most exciting, exotic and least understood frontiers of computing. **********The term cyberspace, popularized in William Gibson's science fiction novel \"Neuromancer,\" refers to the ephemeral otherworld that exists in the global electronic web of computer and communications networks. Although it has its genesis in science fiction, it is a mistake to conclude that it has no significance in the business world. **********If information is indeed the oil of the 21st century, computers are the refineries and networks are the the pipelines. Many companies, especially banks and other financial institutions, exist in the electronic twilight of computer systems. What is the essence of a bank, after all, if not a flow of data? **********Michael Benedikt, a professor of architecture at the University of Texas and editor of the book, refers to cyberspace as an \"elusive and future thing,\" and it remains elusive at the conclusion of the book. Yet the descriptions offered in the book are compelling. The writers work at companies and institutions including the International Business Machines Corporation, Electronic Data Systems, Texas Instruments, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Stanford and M.I.T. **********\"The advent of cyberspace will have profound effects on so-called post-industrial culture,\" Mr. Benedikt writes, \"and the material and economic rewards for those who first and most properly conceive and implement cyberspace systems will be enormous.\" **********Nearer on the horizon, and also promising rewards for business, are expert systems. \"The Rise of the Expert Company\" ($19.95, Times Books, New York City), by the artificial intelligence experts Edward Feigenbaum, Pamela McCorduck and H. Penny Nii, is subtitled \"How Visionary Companies Are Using Artificial Intelligence to Achieve Higher Productivity and Profits.\" **********Artificial intelligence is one of those unfortunate terms that promises more than it delivers. Computers are not yet \"smart,\" but they can serve as repositories for the collected wisdom and experience of senior executives. **********Others, then, can extract the intelligence and apply it to problems that range from product development and administration to manufacturing. A new breed of computer experts called knowledge engineers are creating a form of artificial intelligence known as expert systems. **********Expert systems allow companies, not just individual executives, to work smarter, and among the companies profiled are Du Pont, Fujitsu, Navistar, Northrop, Canon, I.B.M. and American Express. **********This book first appeared in 1988. But the vision it describes is perhaps more important today. Tom Peters, a management consultant and author, writes in the forward, \"Any senior manager in any business of almost any size who isn't at least learning about artificial intelligence, and sticking a tentative toe or two into A.I.'s waters, is simply out of step, dangerously so.\" **********And then there is a book for executives and dreamers who are ready to go beyond toe-dipping and take the plunge. **********\"High-Tech Ventures, The Guide for Entrepreneurial Success\" ($29.95, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Mass.), is by C. Gordon Bell, with John E. McNamara. Mr. Bell, a scientist and engineer, worked 23 years as a research and development director at the Digital Equipment Corporation before becoming a principal in more than 20 high-tech start-up companies. Some succeeded, some failed. The lessons from each are laid down here. **********Anyone thinking of starting a high-tech company, or investing in one, will find this book valuable. Mr. Bell dissects start-ups including Ovation, Analytica, Cirrus Logic, Thinking Machines, Apollo and Sun, in each case offering behind-the-scenes insights into the heady world of high tech. **********\"High-Tech Ventures\" includes an explanation of the Bell-Mason Diagnostic and Prescriptive Method, developed with Heidi Mason, a specialist in high-tech marketing and sales. The Bell-Mason method is a rule-based tool that systematically assesses the health and wisdom of a start-up at several well-defined stages. **********There are charts and graphs aplenty, a natural given Mr. Bell's background as an engineer. These reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of four key elements of any high-tech start-up -- technology/product, people, marketing/sales and finance/ control -- at each of four stages of growth. **********Each area, in turn, is measured in three dimensions. For example, the people quadrant is broken down to the chief executive, the directors and the team. A company can be strong in one area and weak in another, but rarely does a fledgling company succeed with the wrong leadership. **********\"High-Tech Ventures\" concludes with a look ahead, and its predictions are provocative: the United States will continue to lead the world in inventiveness; the Japanese will dominate every market through their strength in innovation. **********One area where American innovation may save the day is in computer programming, especially in an emerging field known as object-oriented programming. **********\"Object Oriented Technology, a Manager's Guide\" ($19.50, Addison-Wesley, paperback), by David A. Taylor, is one of the first accessible guides to the most important trend in software development. **********Mr. Taylor, a management consultant, has a knack for explaining highly technical concepts in a way that executives, managers and other nonprogrammers can grasp. The simple diagrams and illustrations make it virtually painless. **********Object-oriented programming (OOP) holds the promise of making it easier for executives to get the data they need, and it promises to allow businesses to construct software applications in a fraction of the time now needed. It does so by using software \"packets\" that contain data and the instructions necessary to act on the data. **********Only a few personal computer software companies, notably Borland International Inc., are pursuing OOP relentlessly. **********Philippe Kahn, the founder and chief executive of Borland, recently made a videotape explaining \"The World of Objects\" through the medium of Mr. Kahn's jazz band -- an analogy of individual components that know their own data and also how to act on it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/29/business/equity-issues-for-the-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 512, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Issues for the Week", "print_headline": "Equity Issues for the Week", "body_text": " **********The following equity offerings are expected this week:  Affiliated Publications Inc., 2.24 million common shares.

Exley Jr., the company's chairman, said the companies were moving closer to an agreement and would soon continue negotiations. He added, \"It is not going to happen over the Easter weekend if I have anything to say about it.\" **********Although Mr. Exley said he still wanted NCR to remain independent, executives at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said they were optimistic about the apparent shift in Mr. Exley's position. \"There seems to be a new attitude coming out,\" said Robert M. Kavner, a group executive with A.T.& T. \"The environment, for the first time in four months, has changed to the point where a meeting of the minds is possible. There is no reason that it should take long.\"  Wall Street's Reaction **********NCR's share price jumped $2 today, to $99.625, on the New York Stock Exchange, while A.T.& T.'s fell 50 cents, to $34.25. **********Neither company would say when the next session of talks was scheduled. Mr. Exley said that future talks would be multilevel and that he expected to talk again with A.T.& T.'s chairman, Robert E. Allen. **********On a more immediate issue for NCR shareholders, A.T.& T. fell short of the 80 percent support from shareholders needed to replace NCR's entire board, a person close to A.T.&T said last night. But that person added that based on preliminary counts, the telephone company had won control of 4 of NCR's 12 board seats. **********The votes from the annual meeting and the special meeting called to conduct the vote on A.T.& T.'s effort to win control of the board will take about 10 days to tally. A.T.& T. needs a majority of the votes to gain the four board seats. **********In addition to the ballot on control of the board, shareholders voted on a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to NCR's anti-takeover devices. **********The companies must now come to terms on price. Mr. Exley confirmed that on Wednesday he authorized his advisers to seek $110 a share, or $7.45 billion, for NCR, a price that A.T.& T. refused to meet. **********A.T.& T. appears to be adopting a tough bargaining position. Mr. Kavner of A.T.& T. said, \"The $110 price is not on the radar screen of where we see the values of the company.\" **********The person close to A.T.& T. said A.T.& T. might be willing to pay $105 a share in a stock deal if a friendly agreement could be consummated quickly. He had previously said that A.T.& T. had been willing to go as high as about $107 as a premium to get the deal done quickly but that it was growing frustrated by the delays. \"The willingness to pay up is diminishing,\" said the person, who insisted on not being identified. **********Before agreeing to a stock transaction, A.T.& T. would want to make sure that accounting methods adopted by NCR would not make the deal financially harmful. A.T.& T. had been hoping to complete the deal before today's annual meeting. **********One analyst said A.T.& T. executives were annoyed by what they felt were bad faith bargaining tactics engaged in by Mr. Exley earlier in the week. After a long session on Monday that focused mainly on NCR's product line. Mr. Allen said in a letter earlier this week that Mr. Exley was not interested in serious negotiations. **********\"Mr. Exley's shenanigans may have cost NCR a few bucks a share,\" said Jack Grubman, an analyst with Paine Webber who added that he expected a deal to be done soon at around $105 a share. **********\"Price is the only issue and they are not that far apart,\" he said. **********A.T.& T. has offered $90 a share in cash for NCR and has said it would raise its bid to $100 in exchange for a negotiated settlement. In its request for $110 a share, NCR did not say whether it was seeking cash or stock.  The Talk of Dayton **********The annual meeting was the talk of the town in Dayton. The local newspaper, The Dayton Daily News, ran an article comparing the sizes of shrimp at A.T.& T. and NCR receptions. **********The meeting itself was orderly and businesslike. Several shareholders did urge NCR to keep fighting A.T.& T. and remain independent. Paul Granzow, an NCR shareholder who described himself as a native Daytonian, urged fellow shareholders to \"think about more than just a quick buck.\" Speaking of NCR's long involvement in Dayton, he said, \"There are certain things in our lives that are not for sale.\" **********The only heated exchange of the meeting came over a proposal that NCR stop doing business in South Africa.

Kravchuk is something even a butterfly might find impressive. After more than 30 years as a plodding Communist ideologue conditioned to stomp on any manifestations of nationalism, he has abruptly burst forth as the first popularly elected national leader of Ukraine, dedicated to leading it out of the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Kravchuk, of course, is hardly the only former Communist among the leaders of the post-Communist Soviet states. Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Kremlin, Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan are only three of the better known new leaders who rose to political prominence through Communist ranks. **********But even in this company, Mr. Kravchuk's transformation stands out. While the others were mostly managers or administrators in the old days, Mr. Kravchuk spent the bulk of his party career on ideology. **********In Ukraine, in addition to churning out propaganda, that meant combating any sign of Ukrainian nationalism, which the Communist leadership always regarded as a mortal danger -- with some justification, as it turned out.  On the Fence in Coup **********There is little evidence, however, that Mr. Kravchuk's turnaround was a result of a dramatic change of heart. In fact, during the coup last August, when he was still a card-carrying Communist, he took a cautious fence-straddling stance, neither welcoming nor condemning the coup but only urging Ukrainians to stay calm. **********Mr. Kravchuk's metamorphosis, like that of the butterfly, was a matter of natural adaptation. In his case, it was a pragmatic politician's ability to change his colors and slogans as the Soviet Union and Ukraine moved in stages from totalitarian rule to democracy and national self-assertion. **********\"I have read more about Ukraine in the past five years than in all the previous years of my life,\" Mr. Kravchuk confided to an interviewer recently. **********Recognizing the force of Ukrainian patriotism, perhaps from his years of fighting against it, he was the only high-ranking Communist leader to address the founding congress of Rukh, the umbrella organization of independence-minded Ukrainians, in September 1989. **********As the center of power across the nation shifted from the party to the newly elected parliaments, Mr. Kravchuk moved into the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, where he was elected chairman in July 1990. He took to speaking only in Ukrainian, and in September 1990 he quit his post as ideology secretary of the Ukrainian party to devote full time to his parliamentary job, in which he soon became the effective leader of Ukraine.  Carrying Ukraine's Banner **********A master of compromise and adaptation, Mr. Kravchuk maneuvered between the growing nationalism of his republic and the machinations in Moscow, joining in negotiations on a new Union Treaty while guiding his parliament to a declaration of independence. **********After the coup, he declared that he had immediately quit the party in protest, and as the drive for independence gathered momentum he increasingly took up its banner, abandoning any efforts to form a new union while maintaining separate ties with Russia. Last month, he made successful visits to Canada and the United States to garner support for an independent Ukraine from emigres and the Governments. **********White-haired, ruddy and convincing as a speaker, Mr. Kravchuk has his most loyal following among the highly conservative rural population of Ukraine, to which he represents both the emotional attraction of independence and a link with the security and familiarity of the past. **********With these and many other voters, he succeeded in bridging the political gap between the nationalist ardor of Rukh and the large and anxious Russian population, which he went out of his way to reassure.  Teacher of Political Economy **********The son of a farmer, Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk was born in 1934 in the west Ukrainian village of Velyky Zhityn. His father was killed in World War II. **********Mr. Kravchuk went from a vocational school to Kiev University, where he studied Marxist political economy. After graduating at the age of 24, he became a teacher of political economy in the city of Chernovtsy. **********Mr. Kravchuk's wife, Antonina, is a teacher of political economy at Kiev University. They have a son and two grandsons. **********Mr. Kravchuk entered party work in Chernovtsy, but his rise was slow. At the onset of Mr. Gorbachev's rule he was still ideology secretary in a provincial party organization. **********With perestroika, however, he was thrust into Kiev, and once on the wave of events he never slipped."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/17/world/war-in-the-gulf-egypt-exiles-from-kuwait-rejoice-in-cairo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 986, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exiles From Kuwait Rejoice in Cairo", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: EGYPT; Exiles From Kuwait Rejoice in Cairo", "body_text": " **********Hundreds of Kuwaitis drove their cars around the corniche and over briges crossing the Nile River in downtown Cairo, honking and waving flags at around 2 A.M., after news of the American attack against Iraq and Kuwait began to spread here. **********Egyptian television suspended regular programming in the early morning to announce that \"the Persian Gulf battle has started.\" **********Egyptian national radio, which broadcasts around the Arab world, transmitted President Bush's formal announcement of the start of the war at 4 A.M.

Effect on Economy Feared **********Over the last two days, Egyptian newspapers have been filled with commentary warning of the devastating effect that a war will have on the economy of the region. **********Egypt has already suffered the impact of about one million expatriate Egyptians who have returned from Kuwait and Iraq since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Most have come back destitute, and are unable to find employment in an economy that cannot employ much of the work force. **********In addition to the new burden they represent, Egypt has been deprived of the remittances they used to send, a loss that has amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars since August. **********Tourism and the Suez Canal, two other major sources of income for Egypt, have been badly affected. The number of tourists in Egypt now is barely a 10th of the normal figure for this time of year, and fewer ships are traversing the canal. Calm Is Seen in Cairo **********The early morning edition of Al Ahram, the semi-official newspaper, declared that war had started in a banner headline that proclaimed the destruction of all missile bases, Iraqi communications centers, the Baghdad airport and the Iraqi broadcast station. **********\"The Iraqi Air Force was nowhere in the battle of sky,\" Al Ahram said, adding that \"the bombing aims at the total paralysis of Iraq.\" **********Cairo seemed calm and authorities said the airport would function normally today and that Government-owned television would continue to broadcast news in a nonstop fashion to cover the gulf war. **********It even seemed that the apparent success of the first strike against Iraq hads motivated some writers to speak of the beginning of a new erar for the Arab world. **********\"The tragedy of a large number of the population in the Arab world is that it is living in a fog in which its rulers have been turned to gods who demand thatey their subjects kneel and worships them,\" wrote Said Senbel, editor in chief of Al Akbar, the largest Egyptian daily, in a front-page editorial today. **********Mr. Senbel went on to say that the era of empty sloaganeering in praise of Arab dictators hads come to end, \"and it is its a sorry thing that some people never learn.\" Castro Criticizes U.N. **********HAVANA, Jan. 16 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Cuban President, Fidel Castro, criticized the United Nations tonight for the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf. **********In remarks to foreign journalists moments after he was told of the outbreak of fighting in the gulf, Mr. Castro said: **********\"The Security Council had a great arsenal of measures at its disposal, even economic measures, medical measures without embargoing food measures. There could have been other economic measures. There could have been isolation. There could have been more political condemnation. There were a broad range of measures that they could have taken without resorting to weapons. From the beginning to the end, they had only a declaration to war, not to peace.\" **********He also said the war could have its most severe consequences for third world nations like Cuba. He feared that an increase in oil prices would drastically hurt his economy, which is already operating under austerity measures imposed five months ago. Japan Considers More Aid **********TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 17 (Special to The New York Times) -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu summoned his senior national security advisers into an emergency session this morning amid signs that Japan would make some sort of announcement about providing additional financial assistance to the war against Iraq. **********Japanese officials said they would try to prepare a quick announcement of assistance to try to mute possible worldwide criticism over Japan's decision to help pay for the war but not to go into combat itself. **********The officials said Tokyo also wanted to avoid the delays in announcing aid that led to criticism last summer. **********\"The most important message we have right now is that we stand firmly by the United States,\" Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Wednesday. \"We won't have to ask America if they need a contribution.

Hills to begin a formal investigation and negotiations with each country. It would also authorize, but not require, her to increase duties or introduce other restrictions on imports from these countries if no improvements were made by December or early next year. **********The United States and American trade associations are concerned about reports that Chinese companies are copying American pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and computer programs without paying any license fees to the inventors. They have also complained that India and Thailand do not protect American patents on pharmaceuticals and copyrights on records, books and movies.  Difficulty Seen in Citing China **********The recommendation of the Economic Policy Council, which includes President Bush's top advisers on economic issues, does not guarantee that China will be cited. A former Ambassador to China, the President has made American relations with China his personal responsibility and has resisted sanctions proposed in the past for Chinese human rights violations. **********Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, declined to comment. \"There's only one desk officer in this town on China, and that's George Bush,\" she said. **********Wu Jianmin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, warned the United States today that any punitive measures linked to intellectual property rights would hurt relations with China, The Associated Press reported from Beijing. Decision Near on China's Status **********The decision on whether to cite China for failing to protect American intellectual property rights comes almost two years after the Tiananmen Square massacre and less than six weeks before the President must decide whether to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status. This status, granted in 1980, allows Chinese goods to enter the United States at the lowest tariff rates available for each product. **********China's most-favored-nation status is subject to annual renewal by the President with the acquiescence of either house of Congress. When President Bush renewed the status last year, House members angry about Chinese human rights violations voted to cancel the move, but the Senate took no action before going into its summer recess. **********President Bush is required to notify Congress by June 3 of any renewal this year. Opponents of most-favored-nation status for China, who have been led by Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, would then have until Sept. 3 to overturn this step. Special 301 Measure **********The action recommended by the Economic Policy Council on Wednesday night would represent the first time that the United States has cited a country under the so-called Special 301 measure. This measure is a section of the nation's trade law that was amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 to toughen penalties for foreign countries that do not protect American intellectual property rights. **********In 1989 and 1990, the United States put several countries -- including China, India and Thailand -- on a list of countries to be monitored for possible failures to protect American copyrights and patents. **********The Trade Policy Group, an interagency committee of deputies to the members of the Economic Policy Council, recommended last week to the council that Indonesia also be cited, prompting an unusual burst of lobbying by representatives of the Indonesian Government, a Congressional official said today. Indonesia was not included in the final list of countries recommended by the Economic Policy Council, said the Administration officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified. Thai Official's Comment **********Indonesian and Indian officials declined to comment. A Thai official who insisted on anonymity said trade negotiations between Thai and American officials at the United States consulate in Amsterdam ended earlier this week without an agreement on intellectual property. **********In its recently published annual review of foreign trade barriers, the Office of the United States Trade Representative found that China lacked a copyright law and that a planned law fell short of international standards. The Federal agency also cited industry reports that patented American pharmaceutical and oter chemical products were \"being produced in China, without license, for both domestic and export markets.\" **********The report added that \"China, in copying these U.S. products, reaps the benefits without incurring the associated costs\" of development. **********The President's response is imminent because under the Special 301 measure, the United States trade representative, who is part of the President's Executive Office, must identify offending countries within 30 days after issuing its annual report on foreign trade barriers. The report was issued this year on March 29, meaning that the last business day before the deadline is Friday.  Discouraging to Investment **********Roger W. Sullivan, the president of the United States-China Business Council, a Washington-based association of American companies with investments in China, said the lack of protection for intellectual property rights there was discouraging investment. **********Mr. Sullivan said American executives had told him, \"We're not going to go forward with this investment because the guy who supplied us with the process software won't let us go in there.\" **********The trade association has favored the citing of China under Special 301, while continuing to oppose any effort to take away China's most-favored-nation status. \"Some of the companies, particularly the larger ones, feel that this is the way to address the real problems, and not the blockbuster approach\" of removing most-favored-nation status, Mr. Sullivan said. Wider Charges Against China **********China's image in Congress has declined further in recent months because of its ballooning trade surplus with the United States, allegations that it forces political prisoners to produce products for export markets and concerns about its exports of arms and nuclear technology. **********Representative Pelosi plans to introduce a measure next week in the House that would link a renewal of China's most-favored-nation status to its performance on human rights, an aide said today. **********The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also said today that linking trade ties to human rights would hurt American relations with China, The Associated Press reported."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/technology-measuring-how-fast-computers-really-are.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1991-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; Measuring How Fast Computers Really Are", "print_headline": "Technology; Measuring How Fast Computers Really Are", "body_text": " **********In the world of scientific and technical computing, everyone agrees that computer speeds are increasing at a geometric rate. But measuring that speed is a vexing task. Rival supercomputer and work station manufacturers are prone to hype, choosing the performance figures that make their own machines look best. **********\"It's like the Wild West,\" said David J. Kuck, of the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development at the University of Illinois. \"They say whatever they want to.\" **********In fact, said David H. Bailey, a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \"It's not really to the point of widespread fraud, but if people aren't a little more circumspect, the entire field could start to get a bad name.\" **********The matter is complicated by a new generation of computers that have dozens, or even thousands, of separate processors. These parallel computers split problems into small parts and solve them simultaneously to reach greater speeds. **********As a result, dozens of programs for determining benchmarks -- measurements of computer speed -- have been developed by scientists at universities and in government agencies. Some are based on how long a computer takes to solve a certain set of equations, while more sophisticated benchmarks attempt to match the operations required by real-world programs. But each benchmark generally measures only a single aspect of computer performance. **********Just as a car buyer might buy a vehicle with the highest E.P.A. gas mileage rating for the price, a computer buyer could use benchmarks in deciding which machine to buy. But like their counterparts in the auto business, computer makers would do well to remind customers, \"Your mileage may vary.\" The industry has no independent organization, analogous to the Environmental Protection Agency, to establish a single standard. **********The proliferation of benchmarks is particularly problematic among the fastest scientific machines, where more than a dozen start-up companies compete to sell to university, corporate and Government laboratories. **********These machines sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, and the sale of only a few can mean success for a company. Supercomputers and smaller scientific work stations work on problems ranging from designing pharmaceuticals and weapons to weather modeling and the simulated crashing of automobiles. **********Uneasy about the tendency for manufacturers to cite inflated claims, Mr. Bailey of NASA wrote a tongue-in-cheek indictment of performance claims for Supercomputing Review magazine in August. Titled \"Twelve Ways to Fool the Masses When Giving Performance Results on Parallel Computers,\" it pokes fun at the tendency of computer makers to play fast and loose with speed claims. **********It is common practice to \"tune\" computers and software to score better on benchmarks.  \"I know of a couple of companies who have full-time people, and all they do is optimize programs to achieve better benchmark results,\" said Gary Smaby, president of the Smaby Group, a consulting and market research firm in Minneapolis. **********Such optimization is permissible under the rules established by benchmark designers to insure that computer makers can extract the full capability from their systems. **********But some manufacturers go further and insert modules called \"recognizers\" into their compilers -- software that translates a programmer's instructions into machine-readable form. When the recognizer finds a clue that points to a benchmark, it employs a specially written program that is designed to run a benchmark as quickly as possible. **********Computer scientists say recognizers can be used to short-circuit the benchmark-measuring process and should be banned. **********Today the most widely cited benchmark is Linpack. It is a set of linear algebra equations that requires a very large number of mathematical calculations to solve. Currently, the highest Linpack by a traditional supercomputer, measured in millions of mathematical calculations per second, is held by a Cray Y/MP. Its record: 403 million floating point calculations per second. **********There is a similar Linpack measure for makers of massively parallel computers, and this summer the lead seesawed back and forth between Intel's Delta supercomputer and Thinking Machines' CM-200 Connection Machine. At the moment the Intel Delta has achieved the highest Linpack measure, 11.9 billion floating point calculations per second. **********The Linpack benchmark results are expressed as several numbers, including the actual speed at solving the equations and another number called \"theoretical peak performance,\" which represents a computer's absolute peak efficiency. In practice, computers generally reach only a small fraction of their theoretical peak speed. **********Linpack was developed as part of an appendix to a book written by a University of Tennessee computer scientist, Jack Dongarra, in 1979. \"The original benchmark was an accident,\" he said. \"We were writing a book and were attempting to give the user a feeling for how fast particular computers could solve a problems.\" **********The problem, Mr. Dongarra said, was chosen so that it could be run on all of the 20 machines that were being compared. There are now Linpack numbers for more than 500 machines, from laptops to supercomputers. **********Mr. Dongarra acknowledges that Linpack is a limited measure, and he is working on a second-generation measure named Lapack. But a number of other researchers have developed alternative benchmarks in an effort to provide a more complete profile of computer performance. **********One recently introduced benchmark is called Slalom, developed by John Gustafson, a mathematician at the Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory. \"I worked in industry for several years, and I was frustrated by inaccuracy and general lack of credibility in the ways we had of measuring computer performance,\" he said. **********Rather than measuring how quickly a computer can solve a particular problem, Slalom attempts to measure how much work a computer can complete in one minute. **********The problem computers must calculate as part of the Slalom benchmark is measuring the interplay of light in a room in which each surface is painted a different color. A particularly powerful computer will obtain higher resolution in one minute of computing time than a slower one. **********One strength of Slalom is that it measures several aspects of computer performance, including the time taken to set up a problem. Hightest on the Slalom scale is the experimental Intel Delta supercomputer, installed at the California Institute of Technology. **********Another approach has been taken by scientists at the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development at the University of Illinois. The group, called the Perfect Club, has composed a set of speed tests it calls the Perfect Benchmarks, a set of programs that are closely patterned after real programs run by scientific computers. **********These benchmarks attempt to get as close as possible to the ultimate test of a computer's performance -- the actual programs that it will run. \"The only important benchmark for most customers is the code they intend to run, and there is no substitute for that,\" Mr. Smaby said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/24/business/company-news-more-ford-layoffs-a-newspaper-says.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Ford Layoffs, A Newspaper Says", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; More Ford Layoffs, A Newspaper Says", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company plans to lay off 200 more white-collar workers as part of a $3 billion cost-cutting program, according to The Detroit News.

It was only lightly bombed during the gulf war, with about 15 percent of its buildings hit, far fewer than at many other suspected nuclear sites that were almost completely destroyed. **********The allies' failure to destroy this central nuclear installation in the air war against Iraq is a further indication that they underestimated the size of Iraq's nuclear program and overestimated the damage they had inflicted on it. **********On Jan. 23, for instance, a week after the start of the air war, President Bush said, \"Our pinpoint attacks have put Saddam out of the nuclear bomb-building business for a long time.\" **********On different occasions in late January, Gen. H.

But the Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have still not discovered whether Iraq's ambitious uranium-enrichment program had produced enough nuclear explosive \"for an actual explosive device\" by the time it was brought to a standstill by the allied raids. **********The report also reveals that Iraqi scientists were working on a \"surface-to-surface missile system -- presumably the intended delivery system for their nuclear weapon.\" **********Besides destroying only part of the Al Atheer plant, the allies failed even to attack a plant at Furat, outside Baghdad, where Iraq was secretly building uranium-enrichment centrifuges, because they did not know it was part of the weapons-development program. The plant's true purpose was discovered by the Atomic Energy Agency only after the end of the war. **********Like earlier disclosures, the report to the Security Council does not identify any foreign companies or experts that helped Iraq with its nuclear ambitions. But it makes clear that the inspectors have gathered evidence of \"substantial nuclear weapons-related procurement from foreign sources.\" **********It says Iraq drew up lists of \"approved suppliers whose products would meet the program's technical specification.\" But in making these foreign purchases, Iraq sometimes used \"cover names\" to disguise the products' destination. And many of the goods Iraq purchased abroad for its nuclear program were \"multi-use items\" with innocent applications. **********The report also concludes that Dr. Jaffar Dhia Jaffar, the deputy director of Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission, probably had \"the lead technical and administrative responsibility for the nuclear program as a whole, despite his repeated claims that no such program existed.\" **********The United Nations had been looking for a missing \"mastermind\" with overall control of the uranium-enrichment and weapons-design program, largely because Dr. Jaffar, a British-trained Iraqi scientist, claimed he knew only about the enrichment side. **********But on the basis of personnel records removed from Baghdad, the inspectors have now concluded Dr. Jaffar was, in effect, managing both the enrichment and the weapons-design program, although they do not rule out the idea that he may have been helped by unknown foreign scientists. **********Finally, the report reveals that the first site raided by the inspectors last month was an installation identified as \"the Nuclear Design Center,\" and that the second was the headquarters of the \"Petrochemical Three\" project. **********Since neither site had been bombed by the allies, United Nations officials assume that the locations had only recently been discovered by Western intelligence services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/28/world/israeli-general-is-sentenced-to-13-years-in-bribery-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli General Is Sentenced To 13 Years in Bribery Case", "print_headline": "Israeli General Is Sentenced To 13 Years in Bribery Case", "body_text": " **********A former chief purchasing officer in the Israeli Air Force was sentenced today to 13 years in prison for receiving $10 million in bribes and kickbacks on purchases of American-made equipment. **********Brig.

The Bahujan Samaj, appealing to outcastes to use their numerical superiority and seize political power, is teetering on extinction. **********The Bharatiya Janata Party, the new force representing Hindu revivalism and upper caste privilege in a country that is more than 80 percent Hindu, has become the most dynamic national political organization, and in the process is positioning itself as the next hope for that significant part of the Indian middle class that is both Hindu and higher caste. **********The party has captured the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, the home base of the dynasty of Jawaharlal Nehru and the source of all but one of India's Prime Ministers.  Behind the Party's Success **********Mr. Nandy said that the success of the Hindu party had a lot to do with its effectiveness in packaging some of its least attractive appeals to religious chauvinism in the language of nationalism and equality, though equality is oftened defined as the phasing out of minority rights. **********The party, however, also lost ground in states where it had been voted to power a scant year ago, raising questions about whether its success can be sustained. **********The only exception to the \"toss the rascals out\" rule in this election seemed to be the support shown in the state of West Bengal for the Communist Party of India-Marxist, the larger of two Communist organizations. There, Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, in power for 14 years, obtained another term with a majority in the state assembly. The party was also leading in parliamentary contests. **********The restless middle class has traditionally found other ways of gaining power, Mr. Nandy said, through control of news organizations and dominance of a vast Civil Service, among other methods. Many seem to feel that the overly centralized, openly corrupt political system only gets in the way of economic development. **********A young clothing designer was bluntly direct. \"Politicians are all jerks,\" he said. \"There isn't any one of them competent to run this place. They are screwing up business.\"  Big Turnout of Women **********Mr. Nandy said that the failure of the Janata Dal was its inability to make its long-term development aims clear to the expanding middle class -- up to 150 million people out of more than 817 million -- whose traditional commitment has been to its own privileges in an overpopulated society where resources and jobs are scarce. Mr. Singh's affirmative action plan, which he calls essential to the social and economic growth of the nation, frightened and outraged many of them. **********But politicians say that the poor performance of the Janata Dal coalition and the generally inconclusive verdict delivered by a skeptical electorate could also be explained by other factors without long-term implications. **********Madhu Dandavate, Finance Minister in the Government of Prime Minister Singh and one of a lengthening list of former officials defeated in this election, said today in a television interview that in his Maharashtra constituency the turnout of women had been higher than of men. He said he believed that the women voted \"from their hearts\" for the party of the slain Mr. Gandhi. **********A similar trend was observed in the southern state of Kerala, where a resilient Communist-led Government was wiped out in a Congress Party surge -- helped, apparently, by a large turnout of women and tacit help from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which knew it did not have much hope of penetrating the electorate on its own in a region remote from its northern power base. **********Prannoy Roy, a political scientist and polling expert, said his data suggested that Congress benefited not so much from a \"sympathy wave\" after Mr. Gandhi's slaying as from a \"re-energizing\" of Congress supporters in response to the tragedy that had befallen the party.  Congress Seeking Allies **********Whether this modest resurgence of support for Congress is sustained, however, depends on the party's ability to choose the right prime ministerial candidate, the most effective coalition partner and the most vigorous program for dealing with an impending economic crisis in India. **********Congress Party leaders have been phoning and meeting privately with officials of left-of-center parties as well as regional parties to gather the necessary majority in Parliament. A panel of two dozen Congress leaders is expected to name the party's parliamentary leader, and hence its choice for Prime Minister, in time for presentation to the party's legislators on Thursday. **********After Mr. Gandhi's killing, the party leaders, seeking a sympathy vote and without a natural heir to the leadership, immediately turned to his widow, Sonia Gandhi, to ask her to take over. Mrs. Gandhi's rejection forced the party to turn at least temporarily to an ailing 70-year-old Brahmin, P. V. Narasimha Rao. Mr. Rao had faithfully served under Mr. Gandhi, who was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1989, and under his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/world/limerick-journal-an-irish-city-bounces-back-in-the-spirit-of-1691.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1991-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Limerick Journal; An Irish City Bounces Back, in the Spirit of 1691", "print_headline": "Limerick Journal; An Irish City Bounces Back, in the Spirit of 1691", "body_text": " **********People living here in Ireland's third-largest city, along the banks of what James Joyce described as \"the dark mutinous Shannon waves,\" have long been accustomed to hearing their town bad-mouthed by the rest of the country. **********To the smart alecks of Cork and Dublin, Limerick is \"Stab City,\" where no one is safe on the streets. It has been a place to ridicule whether or not one has been there or knows very much about it. There is even doubt that the eponymous poetic form really started here. **********In some ways, Limerick's problems reflect Ireland's: its unemployment rate is at the national average of 20 percent; it is ruefully watching young people emigrate to the Dublin area, Britain or America. **********But in recent years the 1,000-year-old town on the Shannon River in western Ireland has been working hard, with some success, to improve not only its image and the physical look of the place but also the quality of life of its 76,000 people.  Foreign Companies Arrive **********An urban renewal program has cleaned out slums, refurbished the city hall area and attracted foreign companies to a clean, landscaped industrial park, providing hundreds of new jobs. As it finishes a year of celebrating its history, the city is arguing the merits of a renovation of its main medieval castle to attract more tourism. **********The Mayor, Jim Kemmy, a 55-year-old stonemason, said: \"Limerick has no more crime than any other place. The tabloids named us Stab City. The tabloids go for short words.\" **********Indeed, none of Ireland's 17 murders in 1990 were committed in Limerick, and officials say there is no statistical proof that the city is worse than other places. **********Mr. Kemmy said he hoped new industry could bring Limerick back to the prosperity it knew in the time of Peter Tate, who started selling shirts to sailors on the riverbank in the 1850's and became the town's leading employer with a factory that produced uniforms for the British Army and both the Union and Confederate armies in the American Civil War. **********Limerick's modest renaissance has been enhanced by the emergence of a native as one of the most powerful national politicians, Desmond O'Malley. He is the head of the Progressive Democratic Party, which provides six crucial parliamentary votes in the coalition Government of Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey. **********\"Look out at the Shannon at low tide,\" Mr. O'Malley said, sitting in the lobby of the Ryan Limerick Hotel on a recent afternoon. \"It is one of the superb sights in Ireland. There is a waterfall. It is the crossing point that controls the river for 60 miles east and west.\" **********Eight hundred years ago, Mr. O'Malley's ancestors settled issues of river control and economy with axes, pikes and catapults that lofted diseased animals into the enemy throng. Now, he says, the success of the city and the area depends largely on regional planning and financing and on the creation of the Shannon Development Corporation. **********In the old days, the problem was invasions by the Vikings and later the Normans. Now the enemy is Dublin, whose business executives and politicians want to end a longstanding arrangement intended to bring money to the west, the requirement that planes from North America land at nearby Shannon airport, with its huge duty-free shopping area. Some here favor reasonable argument and painful negotiations with the capital; others would seem to prefer the catapult. **********King John's Castle in the center of the city was begun in 1210, lay ignored in recent centuries until the authorities had it refurbished for tourism, and it became the center of another battle. **********The new facade, a network of connected pipes, resembles the Pompidou Center in Paris, the huge modern art museum whose exterior is also a set of crossing pipes and tubes. Some people call the castle \"The Thing.\" **********\"Visually, the outside was not a success,\" Mr. O'Malley said. But inside, he said, are excellent displays of three eras, in archeological layers, of Limerick life -- the ancient Celts, topped by the Vikings, topped by the Normans who built the castle. **********This year, the city celebrated its prime moment in history 300 years ago when it withstood a monthlong siege by the forces of William of Orange, the Protestant usurper of the English crown held by his father-in-law, the Catholic James II. The pro-James Catholic forces surrendered, but not before they won the Treaty of Limerick, which promised them religious freedom. **********Some 12,000 Catholic troops were allowed safe passage to the Continent, and became known in Irish history as the Wild Geese, keeping national hopes and military tradition alive in exile. In succeeding centuries, Limerick kept slipping in national esteem, gaining a reputation for political radicalism. **********But what happened to Limerick in 1691, a defeat that produced a kind of victory, is not unlike what is happening here now. **********And so the people who created the commemoration celebration dug into the poetic history of the limerick. It may be that some of the Wild Geese soldiers learned a five-line satiric poem form in France and brought it back home, where it was used by poets writing in Gaelic to zing their English masters.

Baker 3d has been very tight lipped about what he is trying to do in his talks with Middle East leaders, an approach that appears to be getting a lot of consideration would be for the United States and the Soviet Union to be hosts for a ceremonial opening \"event\" that might be the political equivalent of President Anwar el-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977. **********The event being considered would be a meeting in which the two superpowers would invite Israel, Palestinian representatives, Egypt, Jordan and, ideally, Syria and the six Arab gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- to a ceremonial opening that would be followed by direct talks. **********The Americans \"want to produce some kind of engagement and the critical question is how,\" said a Western diplomat familiar with the secret discussions. American-Soviet \"sponsorship of regional talks is one idea being considered,\" he said. But the diplomat cautioned that the Bush Administration had not yet settled on exactly which approach it wants to push. Changing the Political Climate **********\"Whether anything will work is too early to tell,\" the Western diplomat said. **********Mr. Baker did not broach the idea in his meetings with Middle East leaders two weeks ago, but confined himself instead to discussing confidence-building measures that might make it easier for Arab and Israeli leaders to attend such talks by changing the political climate. Mr. Baker and his Policy Planning Staff director, Dennis Ross, have discussed the idea in follow-up conversations with various Middle East officials in the last few days, and neither Israelis nor Arabs have committed themselves one way or another, the diplomats said. **********Earlier this week, Mr. Baker saw Osama al-Baz, national security adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , and Adnan Abu Odeih, foreign policy adviser to King Hussein of Jordan . Mr. Ross met Tuesday with Hanan Ashrawi, a West Bank Palestinian professor who was in the delegation of Palestinians that Mr. Baker met with during his recent visit to Jerusalem. Israel's Minister of Justice, Dan Meridor, one of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's closest advisers, has also been visiting Washington this week. **********In the present Administration deliberations, after the opening the parties would break into separate Israeli-Arab, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations -- much the way Israel, Egypt and Syria did after the 1973 United States-Soviet Geneva conference. Several venues for such talks have been proposed. Justifying Participation **********The confidence-building measures that Mr. Baker discussed on his trip to the Middle East would be intended to provide the participants with the political cover they would need to attend and to buy some time. Some Arab states, particularly the gulf Arabs, have expressed some unease about going to such a regional meeting as long as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is in power or alive. **********Ideally, confidence-building gestures by Israel to ease the pressure of its occupation of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to reaffirm its commitment to implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, might be used by the Palestinians and the Arab states to justify taking part in such a conference. **********And if Mr. Baker can persuade the Arab countries to move toward ending their state of belligerency with Israel, and possibly all or part of their boycott, the Israeli Government could better justify its participation in such talks. Prime Minister Shamir could argue that that is not the sort of open-ended, gang-up-on-Israel international conference -- in which all five permanent members of the Security Council would be invited -- but rather direct talks with Arab states that have indicated a willingness to reconcile with Israel. **********Mr. Baker has been highly secretive about what he is doing, because he feels that it will give Arabs and Israelis more room for maneuver if every proposal is not debated in public and because he and his aides say they truly are not sure whether any of it will work, diplomats say. Several Thorny Problems **********What optimism existed immediately after the defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait has given way to sobriety in the Administration. Officials dealing with the process say that neither side is itching to make fundamental compromises, like trading land for peace. The whole idea of trying to organize a ceremonial opening for regional talks is based partially on the hope that a dramatic meeting could create some momentum for substantive progress. **********In his private talks with Middle East leaders, Mr. Baker must sort out several thorny problems, including the question of who will represent the Palestinians. **********Also, he must try to establish what would follow the ceremonial opening of such a conference. In 1973, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger already had arranged the Sinai Desert disengagement talks he planned after the Egyptians and Israelis held their Geneva meeting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/11/business/office-glut-spreads-in-california.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1319, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Office Glut Spreads in California", "print_headline": "Office Glut Spreads in California", "body_text": " **********For the last decade, downtown Los Angeles stood as a gleaming testament to Southern California's seemingly boundless economic growth. In rapid succession, new office towers sprouted to house banks, law firms, stock brokerages and others that poured into the city as the region boomed. **********But today, downtown Los Angeles stands awash in vacant office space, a grim reminder to developers and lenders that no region, and no real estate market, is immune to economic dowturn. With new buildings still opening and the recession in California showing no signs of ending soon, the vacancy rate here will only worsen in coming months. **********Developers and building owners are already being forced to slash rents, sometimes to unprofitable levels, to attract the few available tenants. And banks are being forced to write off or renegotiate loans that only a few years ago they were competing with each other to make. **********Los Angeles is the largest -- and only the most visible -- example of how the commercial real estate markets throughout California have weakened precipitously, jolting not just the state's own big banks and developers, but lenders and investors from across the country and around the world. **********Citicorp, the largest banking company in the United States, has about $4.2 billion worth of commercial real estate loans in the West, mostly in California, comprising nearly a third of its $13 billion commercial real estate portfolio. **********\"The commercial market in California is wallowing in a really severe slump, and I don't see it turning up yet,\" said Paul R. Alanis, the president of Koar Inc., a development company that recently put off plans to start a new office building in downtown Los Angeles. **********\"There was a feeding frenzy here, with significant inflation in property values, partly fueled by foreign capital coming in, especially from Japan,\" Mr. Alanis said. \"It tended to obfuscate what was really happening, which was ever-increasing supply and a softening demand situation.\"  Small Consolation **********No is predicting that the California market will go the way of some of the great real estate disaster areas of the 1980's, like Boston, Dallas or Austin, Tex. Indeed, many analysts predict that California will eventually bounce back, thanks to its role as financial center for the West, a hub for the booming Pacific rim area and the state's diverse and historically resilient economy. **********But that is small consolation right now to developers with buildings in the area from San Diego to Irvine to Los Angeles. In downtown Los Angeles, nearly a quarter of all offices stood vacant on Sept. 30, an increase from about 15 percent only a year ago, and about 5.5 percentage points higher than a 35-city average compiled by Cushman & Wakefield Inc., the real estate brokerage firm. Midtown Manhattan's vacancy rate was 16.9 percent, Cushman & Wakefield said. **********To make matters worse here, three big office buildings are still being built downtown, offering space almost equivalent to the Empire State Building. **********Already, the slump has shown up on the bottom lines of California's big banks. Most, including the Security Pacific Corporation and First Interstate Bancorp, have greatly increased their reserves for losses on commercial real estate loans in recent months. Analysts think that otherwise strong banks like Wells Fargo & Company could face additional large write-offs in the next quarter or two.  Still Looking for the Bottom **********\"Our feeling is that the loss situation probably has not bottomed yet, because you don't see the problems peak in real estate until maybe 18 months after the trough of the recession,\" an executive of one of California's largest banks said. **********The situation is also threatening the earnings of Japanese and out-of-state banks that lent heavily to California developers in recent years. Citicorp is the main lender on California Plaza II, a 52-story office tower being built in downtown Los Angeles by Metropolitan Structures West Inc. Just a few months before the building's completion, Metropolitan Structures has leased only about 30 percent of its space. **********The slump has already claimed some casualties. The Equitable Life Assurance Company is foreclosing on the Westin Bonaventure, a hotel in downtown Los Angeles owned by a partnership including John C. Portman Jr., the Atlanta developer, and the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. The First National Bank of Boston foreclosed earlier this year on two office buildings adjacent to the John Wayne Airport in Orange County owned by the McLachan Investment Company. Scores of smaller properties across the state, including office buildings, shopping centers and industrial buildings, have been seized by lenders in recent months. **********\"The volume now is enormous,\" said Kurt DeMeire of County Records Research of Huntington Beach, which tracks property foreclosures in the previously fast-growing Southern California counties of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino. **********The squeeze is likely to continue for months or even years. \"There's no doubt that some owners, whether investors or builder-developers, are experiencing financial problems because cash flows on a lot of properties are insufficient to meet the debt service,\" said Stan Ross, a managing partner at Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a real estate accounting firm in Los Angeles. \"As a result, you're seeing a lot more troubled debt restructurings.\" **********Amid all the gloom, some new projects appear to be relatively successful. A group that includes Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman turned investor, is putting the finishing touches on an office complex in Santa Monica called the Water Garden. The project, financed by Citicorp and the Bank of America, is 65 percent leased and should be 80 percent leased by the end of the year, executives of the development group said. **********Most of the new construction downtown is backed by insurance companies, pension funds, Japanese real estate companies and other deep-pocketed investors that can afford to ride out years of weak income from buildings without being forced to sell at depressed prices. Those new buildings are aggressively wooing tenants from older buildings by offering not only spanking-new surroundings but also deeply discounted rents and other incentives.  Problems at Older Buildings **********As a result, owners of older buildings are already losing tenants, and analysts said many would be unable to pay their bank loans if they could not find new tenants. **********Jonathan Marine, a broker with CB Commercial Real Estate in downtown Los Angeles, said he was negotiating for a large foreign financial institution, which he declined to identified, that wants to move to a new building from an older one. **********The developer of the new building is willing to pick up the tenant's existing lease, which has six years to run, at a cost of $8 million, Mr. Marine said, in return for a 10-year lease in the new building. The developer is also willing to give as much as two years' free rent in the new building, and provide the tenant at least $60 a square foot in cash -- or $4.5 million for 75,000 square feet -- to finish the office's interiors and add furnishings. **********Those terms are far better than developers were offering just a year or two ago, Mr. Marine said, and much more favorable than anything the owner of the tenant's current building can afford to grant. **********Owners of older or less prestigious buildings \"are going to have an impossible time,\" Mr. Marine said. \"There is no demand for those buildings at all.\"  Virtually No New Construction **********If there is good news for the Los Angeles and California real estate markets, it is that new construction has virtually halted. Most economists expect California's recovery to lag the nation's, but they think that within a few years the state will resume its steady growth, albeit at a slower pace than during the roaring Eighties. Eventually, they said, the backlog of office and industrial space will be whittled away as economic growth picks up, forcing rents higher, allowing loans to be repaid and increasing property values. **********\"Longer term, we think the place works,\" said David Shulman, the head of real estate research at Salomon Brothers. \"But in the short run, who knows?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/world/salvador-officers-deny-slaying-role.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1991-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 367, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADOR OFFICERS DENY SLAYING ROLE", "print_headline": "SALVADOR OFFICERS DENY SLAYING ROLE", "body_text": " **********El Salvador's two top military men today denied the allegation of a panel of United States Congressional Democrats that they took part in planning the killing of six Jesuit priests in 1989. **********\"We energetically reject these imputations, which are based on speculation that lacks any evidence,\" Gen.

Only two Senators and no Representatives voted no. **********Twenty-seven of those lawmakers are still in Congress. And as they prepared for Saturday's vote on what was even more clearly the equivalent of a declaration of war, the resolution to authorize the use of military force in the Persian Gulf, the memories of that earlier vote weighed heavily on the minds of the seven senators and 20 representatives who served then and still serve now. **********Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, was in the House in 1964. He recalled the earlier resolution as one President Johnson had \"distorted,\" and one whose repeal he accomplished as a freshman Senator in 1970. **********Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, said caustically, \"It was a declaration of war despite the fact that those who stood in the well and who supported it said it was not.\" He added, \"The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was used as a declaration of war and plunged this country n eight or nine years of really disastrous war in Vietnam.\" **********Not everyone remembered it quite the same way. Representative Charles E. Bennett, Democrat of Florida, said: \"I am 80 years of age. I have been in this chamber 43 years. Out of the 17,000 votes I have cast, the only one I really regret is the one I cast for the Bay of Tonkin Resolution. I particularly regret it, because I knew it was a declaration of war.\" **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, did not offer second thoughts about his old vote, but said the Persian Gulf decision was even more difficult for him. \"Today's situation is clearer,\" he said in a statement in the Congressional Record. \"The possibility of armed conflict, casualties and even death is much more apparent.\" **********In that group of 27, some were silent last week. Among those who spoke, several did not hark back to the 1964 vote. But few avoided comparisons with Vietnam more generally. For example, Representative Frank Horton, Republican of Rochester, recalled his years in Congress during the Vietnam War. **********\"From that experience I learned the lesson of what can result from the commitment of troops to a conflict where our interests are not so clear, where objectives are not defined,\" Mr. Horton said. In the Persian Gulf, he said, those interests were as clear as they had been when he fought as an infantry companmy commander in World War II. **********When it came time to vote, 12 of the Tonkin veterans voted to authorize force and 14 voted against it.

The reason: yields on C.D.'s and other short-term investments like money market funds have dropped. **********As of Oct. 1, one-year C.D.'s were yielding just 5.66 percent on average, according to Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla. **********The interest rates that banks could pay were deregulated in October 1983, and because C.D.'s are sold mostly in six-month and full-year units, October remains the biggest month for C.D. rollovers. Rates are now at their lowest level since deregulation, and a recent survey by Gallup and Fidelity Investments found that fewer than one-third of the investors with certificates coming due were committed to reinvesting in C.D.'s. **********One easy alternative to C.D.'s is money market funds, but their yields are even lower. The seven-day compound yield for taxable money funds was 5.29 percent as of Oct. 1, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report in Holliston, Mass. **********New Yorkers and investors in other high-tax states can do better with United States Treasury money market funds, where earnings are exempt from state and local taxes. The Dreyfus 100 Percent U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund was yielding 5.80 percent before taxes. This generally produces an after-tax yield of 6.39 percent for California investors and 6.61 percent for New York City investors. **********Anything else involves more risk than C.D. or money fund investors are accustomed to. \"To get more yield, you have to take more risk,\" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago. **********Investors can minimize credit risk -- the risk that issuers will not repay interest or principal -- by staying with high-quality bond funds. Even so, going longer than the 90-day maximum permitted for money funds exposes investors to interest rate risk. Investors in foreign bond funds also assume currency rate risk. **********One way to minimize the overall level of portfolio risk is to mix the various types of risk, Mr. Phillips suggested. That said, what are investors' choices among high-yielding mutual funds? The following are suggestions, with discussions of the risk each entails. *********** Short- and intermediate-term bond funds. Unlike C.D.'s or money market funds, bond funds can lose value if interest rates rise. So while the yield looks good, the total return -- yield plus changes in principal -- may not. In the long term, it is total return that counts. **********To decrease risk, choose funds with shorter maturities. Short-term bond funds invest in securities maturing in one to five years. Among short-term government funds, Mr. Phillips recommends 20th Century U.S. Government, with a yield of 6.95 percent and a total return of 10.89 percent in 1991 through Sept. 30. On the corporate side, he likes T. Rowe Price Short-Term Bond Fund (yield, 7.17; total return, 10.05 percent). **********Intermediate-term funds invest in securities maturing in five to 10 years, so yields are slightly higher. Mr. Phillips likes the Benham Treasury Note Fund (yield, 7.07 percent; total return, 12.97 percent) and the Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund (yield, 7.64 percent; total return 13.29 percent). *********** Mortgage funds. There are two basic types: adjustable-rate mortgage funds and Ginnie Mae funds. The adjustable-rate funds were developed to compensate for the volatility of the fixed-rate Ginnie Mae funds, whose prices move around to compensate for shifts in market interest rates. **********The tradeoff: monthly dividends fluctuate more than they would with a standard Ginnie Mae fund. And the funds' yields drop when interest rates fall, as the borrowers' rates are adjusted downward. When rates rise, the funds lag because rates on the underlying mortgages are not adjusted immediately. **********In both adjustable-rate and Ginnie Mae funds, when mortgages are prepaid the money is reinvested at lower rates, cutting the funds' yields. Mr. Phillips recommends the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund (yield, 8.63 percent; total return, 9.59 percent) and the Vanguard G.N.M.A. Portfolio Fund (yield, 8.26 percent; total return, 16.67 percent.) *********** Short-term global income funds. These funds take advantage of foreign interest rates that are higher than United States rates. To minimize credit risk, they hold government securities and high-quality short-term corporate paper. To control currency risk, they rely on sophisticated hedging techniques. For investors who want to go this route, Alliance Short-Term Multi-Market Trust class A (yield 9.95 percent; total return 10.64 percent) is Mr. Phillips's choice. **********Next week: High-yielding stock funds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/world/tunisia-arrests-300-muslims-charging-plot-to-stage-coup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tunisia Arrests 300 Muslims, Charging Plot to Stage Coup", "print_headline": "Tunisia Arrests 300 Muslims, Charging Plot to Stage Coup", "body_text": " **********Security forces have arrested nearly 300 Muslim militants, including 100 army men, who planned to overthrow the Tunisian Government and create an Islamic state, Interior Minister Abdallah Kallel said today. **********He said at a news conference all those arrested were members of Nahdha, an outlawed Muslim fundamentalist movement. **********He said that in the final phase of the plot the 100 soldiers, including several officers with the rank of major, were to seize key points when the authorities called in the army to deal with demonstrations organized by Nahdha."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/world/havana-closes-communist-congress-to-outsiders.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1991-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Havana Closes Communist Congress to Outsiders", "print_headline": "Havana Closes Communist Congress to Outsiders", "body_text": " **********Faced with a severe economic and political crisis, Cuba has announced that for the first time in the 32-year leadership of President Fidel Castro the coming congress of the island's ruling Communist Party will be closed to foreign delegations and journalists. **********The departure from previous practice, a number of experts on Cuban affairs said, reflects a sense of uncertainty within the Cuban leadership bordering on disorientation after the announcement by the Soviet Union last week that it was withdrawing its troops and ending its economic subsidies to the island. **********But some of the specialists noted that the decision also reflected a growing view in Cuban society and elements of the party that fundamental changes were needed.

The hourlong video, culled by the agency from television around the world, brimmed with cleverness and was offered as proof that the approach, often considered negative and unseemly, can instead be creative and effective. **********Coincidentally, Burnett executives have also been giving clients a 24-page report from its research department proffering a similar view: that comparative advertising \"can, indeed, result in fresh, different and superior advertising.\" **********The aim of the Burnett video and paper is to make advertising executives and clients feel more confident and comfortable with the approach, which has often been criticized, particularly in political campaigns. The theme is timely because comparative advertising seems in vogue now. With the country battling recession, many advertisers say they are more inclined to wage aggressive campaigns to topple competitors. **********Executives at Leo Burnett say the video and report do not represent an attempt to persuade clients or copywriters to use comparative advertising more frequently. They were intended merely to stimulate thinking. **********Still, Burnett's actions reflect a continuing debate industrywide about the use of such advertising. Even supporters say it is executed poorly all too often. **********\"It's very clear that the term 'comparative advertising' has a very bad connotation among a lot of people,\" said Babs Thomas, the Leo Burnett executive who wrote the paper and a vice president in the agency's research department. **********\"The problem is when you say the term people tend to think of the lowest common denominator: 'Buy this; the other guy's product stinks.' The kind of no-brainer, non-creative approach. But that really is not the only way to execute good comparative advertising.\" **********The video makes the point graphically in examples of superior comparative advertising from agencies like the old Doyle Dane Bernbach from the 60's. One commercial for the Volkswagen Beetle that uses deadpan humor to make its point shows two cars parked in front of identical suburban homes. A narrator explains that each homeowner has $3,000 to spend on a car. One spends the whole $3,000 on his purchase. The other buys a refrigerator, numerous other appliances -- and a new Volkswagen. **********Burnett's paper says consumers are typically turned off not because they do not approve of naked comparisons but because the actual advertising is often mediocre. **********The problems often include consumer confusion about which product is being advertised and annoyance that such advertising does not explain well why one brand is better. The report says that campaigns that claim product superiority solely on consumer preference are often found to be strident and offensive. **********Even when an advertisement properly explains a difference, consumers often find the argument irrelevant, the report said. For example, Burnett showed one comparison of \"our brand's\" fresh ingredients and the competition's dry ingredients. But the ingredient comparison ends up having little or nothing to do with how consumers make brand choices. **********\"Indeed,\" the report said, \"one competitive user reasoned, 'I never knew that my brand used dry ingredients. That must mean I like the taste of dried ingredients better.' \" **********Agency executives said it was wrong to make generalizations about the approach, but they were sure it had its place. **********\"It's risky and has a greater tendency to flop,\" said Tedd Sann, the BBDO vice chairman who wrote \"Archeology,\" the commercial in which Pepsi-drinking students in a future time find a relic so obscure they cannot identify it.

A favorable inflation outlook, a \"sense that the economy could flounder,\" and low short-term interest rates are compelling arguments for investors to purchase longer-dated issues, Mr. Sullivan said. **********In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 102 23/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Thursday and 7.93 percent on Sept. 13. **********With economic fundamentals favoring lower bond yields \"it now seems quite likely\" that long-term Treasury yields will fall to 7 3/4 percent in the near term, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants.

Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.22 percent.

But the trend has been against the Government, and some think it points to a disturbing pattern of regulators trying to reduce the cost of Federal bailouts at the expense of the law. **********The validity of that interpretation, however, is still a matter of debate. **********Rosemary Stewart, a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington and former director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision, thinks the courts have recognized that regulators \"are going too far.\" **********\"In a vengence mentality after the savings and loan crisis,\" she said, \"the Government is trying to get everything it possibly can.\" **********But Alfred J. T. Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, feels the court decisions \"reflect either a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the new law, or both.\" **********\"We do not draw any conclusion that there is a tide flowing against the Government agencies,\" he said. **********No one contests the power of regulators to seize assets of insolvent banks and savings and loans in order to protect depositors' money. But several cases turn on interpretations of the savings and loan industry bailout legislation enacted by Congress in August 1989. **********Two cases test the retroactive application of that law. They involve the seizure by regulators in March 1989 of several healthy Texas banks after their parent banks, MBank in Dallas and the Texas American Bank in Fort Worth, became insolvent. **********Regulators pushed more than a dozen healthy subsidiary banks of the two companies into insolvency by failing to fully repay loans that the subsidiary banks made to the parents. Two courts have said that the subsidiaries are owed full payment under then-prevailing banking laws, but the Government is appealing on the ground that the 1989 bailout law permited only partial repayment. **********The F.D.I.C. has since lobbied successfully to have the 1989 bailout law permit unequal payments to creditors of failed banks. **********In another group of cases, regulators' attempts to abrogate concessions given to entice investors to buy failing savings and loans have been challenged. Eight of these cases have gone against the Government, four have gone in its favor and, in two others, the court said it had no jurisdiction. **********The Government has lost three other cases that involved attempts by regulators to collect money from owners of failed savings and loans by forcing them to put up new capital after institutions were declared insolvent. **********The 1989 bailout law is also being questioned in a group of cases involving concessions given by regulators to buyers of troubled savings and loans before the law's enactment. Regulators contend that the new law permits them to disregard these concessions, which are generally forbearances allowing newly acquired savings and loans to operate with lower capital requirements or more liberal lending policies than permitted by law. **********One of the best known in this group of cases involves Far West Federal Bank, a Portland, Ore., savings and loan that regulators sold to investors in 1987. In return for investing some $27 million of capital, the Government gave the new investors 10 years to meet capital requirements and approved a liberal lending policy. **********But with the 1989 bailout law, regulators told Far West that it was out of compliance with the law and that its owners faced daily fines of up to $1 million. Far West quickly complied, but as a result began losing money; officers and depositors fled and its balance sheet shrank. **********Far West's owners now say the Government can take the institution back -- they just want their $27 million returned, along with $100 million in damages. United States District Judge Owen M. Panner agreed, ruling that regulators violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against illegal seizure of property and that their action was \"economic suicide\" for Far West.\" Damages have yet to be set. **********A final batch of rulings against the Government involves attempts by regulators to collect money by enforcing capital requirements after a savings and loan failed. One leading case involves a Texas company named Tetco, which in 1983 bought a Texas savings and loan in San Antonio called the Bexar Savings Association. To get deposit insurance, Tetco agreed to certain capital levels and to add more when necessary. Over time, Tetco sunk some $25 million into Bexar. **********Bexar, however, suffered losses and was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in February 1989, wiping out Tetco's investment. The Government then sued Tetco for $558 million -- the amount needed for Bexar to meet its capital requirements if it were still alive. But United States District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in San Antonio dismissed the Government's claim, as did judges in two similar cases elsewhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/29/business/company-news-takeover-talks-begun-by-newmont-mining.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1991-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 328, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Takeover Talks Begun By Newmont Mining", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Takeover Talks Begun By Newmont Mining", "body_text": " **********The Newmont Mining Corporation, the largest North American gold producer, said yesterday that it had begun talks to be acquired by the American Barrick Resources Corporation, another leading gold producer, in a stock exchange estimated by analysts to be worth about $2.4 billion. **********Under the terms of the proposed agreement, 1.8 shares of American Barrick would be exchanged for each Newmont Mining share.

Mr. Ovitz was also involved in the $3.5 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures by the Sony Corporation in 1989. **********Creative Artists counts as its clients more than 650 top Hollywood actors, directors and screen writers, including Paul Newman, Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner.

Under the new S.E.C. proposal, public companies would have to pay an annual fee that would be used to finance the agency.  Bigger Range of Violations **********The increase in the amount of litigation stems in large part from new authority granted to the S.E.C. late last year, which expanded the range of violations that could result in fines. Before the additional powers were granted, the agency frequently settled litigation in exchange for milder sanctions that did not involve fines.

They are the behind-the-scenes workhorses of an industrial economy, used for cutting, grinding and boring all sorts of products, including armaments. **********In both World Wars, machine tools were officially earmarked for hurry-up production, regarded as vital to wartime mobilization. And in the 1980's, the decline of the domestic machine tool industry was seen as a symbol of both the plight of American manufacturing and Japan's export offensive. **********Today, the industry is once again at the center of a debate that touches on the larger issues of trade policy and national security. The Bush Administration must soon decide whether to push to extend a five-year-old program of restraints on imported machine tools. And it promises to be a tough choice this time because of the growing complexity of global trade patterns and the recent changes in the geopolitics of national security. Renewal Is Uncertain **********The Commerce Department is expected to make a recommendation within days on whether to renew the five-year program of restraints, which expires at the end of this year. The department's recommendation -- expected to be a call for renewal -- will then be reviewed by the Administration after consulting with other agencies, including the Defense Department and the United States trade representative's office. The outcome of that review is by no means certain, according to Administration officials. **********The advocates and opponents of import restrictions no longer line up in neat camps. A handful of America's most competitive machine tool makers, for example, want the protections for domestic producers dismantled because they have had the curious effect of protecting Japanese market share and driving up the costs for many American producers. **********One problem with the complex system of import curbs, they note, is that it defines an American machine by how much of the rudimentary cast-iron components are American-made but ignores the computer controls, which represent more and more of the cost of a modern machine tool. The largest supplier of such controls is a Japanese company, Fanuc Ltd. **********So the free-traders say that those who favor restraints are taking a backward-looking \"Maginot Line\" approach to international competition. \"The people who want to maintain the restraints are trying to fight a war that is already over,\" said Brian McLaughlin, president of Hurco Companies, an Indianapolis machine tool producer. \"Protectionism doesn't work. The only way to revive this industry is to focus on research and development, to develop leading-edge technology and to compete globally.\" **********For their part, the Japanese, who were the main targets of the curbs, are officially silent on the matter but would be happy to see the restraints renewed. The so-called voluntary restraint agreement serves to freeze Japan's large share of the American market, while restricting the advance of up-and-coming rivals like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.  A Different World **********National security calculations today are also far different than when the Reagan Administration prodded Japan and Taiwan into the voluntary restraint agreement in 1986. Back then, the United States reasoned that it should not depend on foreigners for machine tools to make parts for missiles and bombs. **********But those were still the \"evil empire\" days, when the Soviet military threat meant just that and before the Berlin wall had been torn down. \"All these national security arguments have been deflated enormously because of recent events,\" said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. **********Most companies in the machine-tool industry and 200 members of Congress eager to protect jobs back home insist that the national security argument still holds. \"National security is pre-eminent to commerce,\" said James Mack, the vice president for government relations at the Association for Manufacturing Technology, the industry's trade group. **********The pure free-traders, Mr. Mack said, \"want this country to be the Blanche DuBois of international trade politics -- always dependent on the kindness of strangers,\" in a reference to the faded Southern belle of Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" **********The restraint agreement allowed the Japanese producers to hold more than 50 percent of crucial machine tool markets like computerized lathes and machining centers, while warning other countries that they would be slapped with penalties if they rushed to increase their sales in the United States. The Taiwanese were pressured to join the agreement, partly to make it seem that the Japanese alone were not being punished. **********Opponents of renewal argue that the restraint pact has increased their costs by forcing them to buy more expensive domestic-made components, irritated overseas buyers and had the \"perverse\" effect of protecting the Japanese producers since their share of the market was calculated when the yen was cheap and imports at a peak. **********Yet the experience at Hurco, based in Indianapolis, shows the costs of the voluntary restraint agreement on one high-technology machine-tool maker. With sales of about $100 million a year, Hurco is a company that revived in the late-1980's by investing in research on computer controls and software, increasing productivity and moving aggressively into foreign markets. More than half of its sales are now overseas, including East Asia. **********At Hurco, Mr. McLaughlin estimated that the restraint agreement had forced his company to increase its cost of making a machine tool by more than 10 percent. He said the company it was forced to buy more expensive components domestically, like the cast-iron base and housings on machine tools, instead of buying less expensive ones from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. The additional cost in one of the cheaper $70,000 machines would be roughly $7,000, according to Mr. McLaughlin. **********Hurco was also forced to invest $6 million in new patterns and in establishing new sources of supply for machined cast-iron parts so they could qualify as American machines under the restraint accord. That money, Mr. McLaughlin said, would have otherwise been invested in research on the computer controls and software that are Hurco's competitive forte. **********The import restraints brand the United States as protectionist and thus can make selling overseas more difficult for American companies, according to Ray Blakeman, the chairman of the Met-Coil Systems Corporation, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company that has a joint venture in Japan and a sales office in Taiwan. **********Mr. Blakeman, a former president of the machine tool trade association, wrote to its board in August to protest the group's support for an extension of the agreement. \"We are riding a mule that is crippled and should be out to pasture,\" he wrote.  Plea for More Time **********Yet the proponents of continuing the import curbs say the agreement has safeguarded the domestic industry, allowing it to increase investment. An extension of three to five years, they add, would give the domestic industry the time it needs to regain competitiveness. The industry's revenues have increased slightly since 1986 to an estimated $2.9 billion this year, while employment has declined more than 8,000 people, to 60,150. **********At K. T. Swasey, a machine tool maker in Milwaukee, Winthrop Cody says the import curbs helped give his company the breathing space it needed to invest heavily in computer-aided design equipment and training for engineers. He estimated that the productivity of his operations increased 25 percent in the last four years. **********Without the import curbs, \"countries like Japan and Taiwan would take even more of our market because they will cut prices to gain market share regardless of the cost,\" said Mr. Cody, president of Swasey, which is a subsidiary of the Cross & Trecker Corporation. **********Economists and trade experts have generally scorned the use of voluntary restraint agreements in industries including autos, specialty steel, textiles and ball bearings as costly to consumers and of little genuine help to the protected industries. At best, the curbs may temporarily slow the shrinkage of a domestic industry and encourage foreign producers to set up factories in the protected country to sidestep the barriers. Indeed, the Japanese machine tool companies including Mazak, Okuma, Toyoda and Amada now have plants in the United States. **********The real hope for the future of the American machine tool makers, some experts say, is to increase their competitiveness in their basic businesses and band together to develop new computer-controls technology to leapfrog the Japanese and other rivals. **********A few such joint research efforts are under way. For example, a next-generation controller program, supported by $20 million from companies, the Air Force and the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a research consortium in Ann Arbor, Mich., was begun in 1988. \"That effort could have a monumental impact on American manufacturing,\" said Ed Miller, president of the center. \"But it's not going to have an effect today or tomorrow.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/14/world/mandela-hopeful-on-negotiations.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1991-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANDELA HOPEFUL ON NEGOTIATIONS", "print_headline": "MANDELA HOPEFUL ON NEGOTIATIONS", "body_text": " **********The long awaited conference of political parties that would lay the groundwork for formal negotiations on South Africa's post-apartheid future looks increasingly likely to get under way by the end of this month. **********\"The all-party conference is set down for the 29th and 30th of November,\" Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, said today.

Mrs. Bechtel, who had had a falling out with the Claremont center, imposed no restrictions on the photographs' use, and Dr. Moffett of the Huntington Library said the other day that scholarly access to them should be the same as for other library holdings. **********But the Israeli view is that the original restrictions still apply. **********Critics of the monopoly system have accused the scrolls' custodians of being deliberately slow in publishing their research and of withholding manuscripts from all but favored colleagues. In turn, the custodians have insisted that much of what remains consists of text fragments and that making them freely available risked having them fall into incompetent hands. **********Essentially, that remains Mr. Drori's argument, and he warned that allowing anyone to study the documents put the possibility of a \"definitive interpretation\" at risk. **********His opinion was echoed by Mr. Broshi, one of those supervising the research. \"It would flood the market and swamp the area with secondary productions,\" Mr. Broshi said. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Broshi acknowledged that control over the manuscripts might have been too tightly restricted. \"But the thing has been reorganized,\" he said. \"Instead of 3 or 4 scholars, we now have about 40 scholars -- young, ambitious people who are hungry for promotion. We expect them to do the work in good order.\" **********Researchers at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati this month announced the publication of the first volume of a computer-generated reconstruction of scroll texts.

The project initiates a chapter in the neighborhood's rejuvenation and in the city's efforts to provide affordable housing. **********Seventy-five condominium town houses and apartments are planned on the site at Selleck Street and Southfield Avenue; they will be sold to people with annual earnings of $35,000 to $50,000 who have had difficulty finding a home they could afford in the city. **********Prices are expected to range from $65,000 for the smallest apartment, a one-bedroom unit of 651 square feet, to just under $100,000 for a three-bedroom town house with 1,263 square feet. The average selling price of condominiums in the city, including town houses, is $143,533, said Allen Schaps, president of the Stamford Board of Realtors. **********Called Waterside Green, the $8 million project is being developed by the Stamford Waterside Development Corporation, a joint venture of two nonprofit groups: the countywide Fairfield 2000 Homes Corporation and the local New Neighborhoods Inc. The Connecticut Housing Financing Authority provided a $5 million construction loan at a below-market rate, and $1 million for start-up costs came from New Neighborhood's Revolving Loan Fund -- a pool of money collected through contributions from local businesses. **********Also making the project affordable are low-cost mortgages, with rates of about 8.5 percent. They will be offered to buyers of the 75 Victorian-style units through the housing mortgage finance authority, said John Madeo, executive director of Fairfield 2000. Construction and sales are to start April 15, he said, with completion in about a year. **********The architect for the project is Zane Yost & Associates of Bridgeport, Conn. **********The site used to be home to the John J. Ryle elementary school, and recyling land that once housed public buildings has been a fact of life across the nation since the mid-80's construction frenzy. Such is the case in Stamford, where the Ryle school, which closed a decade ago, is among the city's inventory of unused municipal properties. **********While the city always envisioned having affordable housing built on the site, high land and construction costs blocked the project until now, said Jon A. Smith, director of planning and zoning for the city. Today's depressed housing market, he noted, aided its redevelopment. **********In 1989 the city contracted to sell the site to Waterside for $2 million, $1 million less than its appraised value, Mr. Smith said. Financing for the acquisition came from the State Department of Housing's Land Trust Program, which carries restrictions to keep the units forever affordable. **********The significance of this project for Stamford, Mr. Smith said, is that \"it puts land back on the tax roll, stabilizes the neighborhood and produces much-needed middle-income housing.\" Though Stamford saw extensive commercial development in the mid-80's, residential growth lagged. **********To reverse that trend, Mr. Smith said, a revised city master plan in 1987 called for residential development within Stamford's central business district and the fringe area surrounding it. Two mixed-use projects, together totaling 250 rentals and 400,000 square feet of commercial space, have taken shape there in the last four years, and more than 1,000 additional residences are planned within two blocks of the core. **********Mr. Smith said that Waterside Green supported the city's plan to direct growth into four neighborhoods, including Waterside. Among the oldest parts of the city, Waterside, so named because it edges the west branch of Stamford harbor, began to falter in the 1960's when companies followed by families fled to the suburbs. The lack of new development also took its toll. **********But in the last few years that began to change as private developers took a chance on the mixed-income neighborhood, which has subsidized housing in the northern sections and houses selling for up to $1 million in the south. **********Bruce L. Warwick, chairman of Fairfield 2000, said the hope was that redevelopment of the school site, which he described as a gateway to the Waterside community, would \"anchor the neighborhood and spur future development.\" **********Because it was too costly to renovate the school, it was decided to raze it, Mr. Warwick said. **********He said the partners, working with the city and Waterside Task Force, a local residents' group, designed the project to incorporate features that typical home buyers would want. Among them are private entrances for each of the town houses as well as private backyards that back onto common open space. **********The residences will be grouped in four clusters at the corners of the property, with 17 to 22 units in each cluster, giving the project the feel of a suburban residential enclave despite its urban location."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/25/business/company-news-northrop-proposes-18-million-settlement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Northrop Proposes $18 Million Settlement", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Northrop Proposes $18 Million Settlement", "body_text": " **********A stockholders' lawsuit accusing officials of the Northrop Corporation of wrongdoing in the 1980's would be settled for $18 million under a proposal by the military contractor. **********Federal District Judge David V.

A big one is the tendency of the Western European countries, on one hand, and the United States, Mexico and Canada, on the other, to create regional trading blocs that give preferential treatment to products produced and sold within each region. **********The Bhagwati view of such trends, briefly stated, is that free trade will produce the greatest wealth over the long run; barriers only divert the flow of goods and services, rather than making them multiply.

The closest-priced novels are selling for a full $5 less. The publisher, Random House, said it had no choice but to charge that much, because at nearly four pounds \"Harlot's Ghost\" weighs as much as a roast that could feed eight people, and at 1,328 pages it has more heft than the average King James Version. **********\"Even at this price, it's underpriced,\" said Bruce Harris, who is in charge of sales at Random House. \"It costs a lot to produce a book this size. It had to be done.\" **********If Random House gambled correctly and readers make the book a best seller, people in the industry say, other publishers will push up the prices of their novels, even ones that do not match the formidable dimensions of \"Harlot's Ghost.\" **********There does not seem to be a hard and fast reason why nonfiction has traditionally been priced higher than fiction. Publishers say that people buy fewer copies of nonfiction, so the production costs are ultimately higher, and that the audience for nonfiction has generally been more affluent than the fiction audience and thus more willing to spend money. **********Until recent years, moreover, there was a long-held feeling within the industry that publishers are somehow morally obliged to keep novels within the financial reach of most readers -- even at the risk of losing money -- because literature is a \"product\" that cannot be copied and sold like knockoff suits for a cheaper price. **********But publishers say they can no longer be oblivious to market realities. With the recession and with more and more publishing houses being bought up by multinational corporations that demand balanced budgets, publishers in the last few years have begun to think and act more like business people. 'An Underpriced Commodity' **********The $30 novel is not a statement or a gamble, they say. It is as realistic as a $10,000 economy car, a $7.50 movie ticket and a $2 ice cream cone. **********\"Books cost this much to make,\" said Barry Lippman, publisher at Macmillan Inc. \"There's no other place a publisher recoups his money but in the cost of the book. And books are an underpriced commodity from a pure product point of view.\" **********Mr. Lippman points to a study showing that the price of books had risen very little over the last decade, compared with the price of, say, an Ivy League education, a car, a movie or a house. **********By his calculations, the average price of a house has risen 83 percent, to $140,000 in 1990, from $76,400 in 1980; the price of a Ford Thunderbird has gone up 157 percent, to $17,480 from $6,808, and movie prices have increased 114 percent, to $7.50 from $3.50. Meanwhile, according to Mr. Lippman's chart, hard-cover fiction has risen 64 percent, to $17.95 from $10.95. Likelihood of Discounts **********Many readers who buy the new Mailer book will not even pay the full $30 list price, because the large chain bookstores generally sell books at a discount, particularly if a book either is a best seller or has big expectations. **********A spokeswoman for the Barnes & Noble book chain said its stores would sell \"Harlot's Ghost\" at a 15 percent discount, or $25.50, and would double the discount if the book made The New York Times best seller list. **********Random House did not come easily to its decision to price the book at a record $30. And despite mixed reviews, executives there are not publicly questioning their choice. They took a similar, much-discussed gamble with a nonfiction volume last year when they priced a book based on the PBS television series \"The Civil War\" by Ken Burns, at $50, far above the nonfiction standard. It became a best seller. **********Setting the price for the Mailer book was one of the first big decisions for Harold Evans when he took over as publisher at Random House earlier this year. \"There was a lot of cold feet about doing it,\" Mr. Evans recalled, \"a feeling that a $30 novel would put people off.\" 'Unthinkable' Cutbacks **********So, the internal hand-wringing began. Could Mr. Mailer be persuaded to trim the manuscript? The idea was \"unthinkable\" to the book's editor, Jason Epstein, Mr. Evans said. Could the text be set in smaller type with tighter margins to cut the number of pages? \"I thought it was a bad idea,\" Mr. Evans said. \"It's really a beautiful book and very easy to read this way.\" **********Mr. Evans casually polled booksellers about the price. Some winced, he said, but most said that the $30 novel was an inevitability and that of all contemporary authors, Mr. Mailer was the best one for the gamble. **********\"If ever there was a book that you would risk breaking the $30 price barrier with, this is it,\" said William S. Lofquist, a publishing analyst at the United States Department of Commerce. \"You've got the huge size of the book; you have a great, very hot subject -- the C.I.A. -- and you have a dynamite author who's a name brand, like Colgate.\" **********After running through and rejecting a host of ways to cut the production costs, Random House decided to leap over the $30 breach. \"At the end of the day,\" Mr. Evans concluded, \"Mailer is worth it.\" 200,000 Advance Orders **********Booksellers also seemed to think the risk was worth it. In all, they placed advance orders for 200,000 copies of the book. **********Stuart Applebaum, a vice president at Bantam Doubleday Dell, said he still remembered the \"hue and cry\" when Delacorte priced James Clavell's novel \"Noble House\" at $19.95 in 1981. \"People were saying then that this is going to destroy the hard-cover fiction industry to have a novel at such a high tariff,\" Mr. Applebaum said. \"And the industry survived, and here we are with a $30 upper limit.\" **********As pleasures go, reading a novel -- even one with a $30 price tag -- is still relatively cheap. A two-hour movie at $7.50 a ticket ends up costing about 6 cents a minute, while Mr. Mailer's book, read at a pace of about two minutes a page, runs about a penny a minute. And when measured by weight, \"Harlot's Ghost\" comes out at just under 50 cents an ounce, while the same amount of Beluga caviar fetches about $55."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/17/world/european-force-is-proposed-for-croatia.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1991-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "European Force Is Proposed for Croatia", "print_headline": "European Force Is Proposed for Croatia", "body_text": " **********Alarmed by the increase in fighting in Yugoslavia, Western European countries moved closer today to dispatching a military peacekeeping force with a view to securing a permanent cease-fire in Croatia. **********The Netherlands, which currently holds the presidency of the European Community, proposed today that Western European countries consider deploying a \"lightly armed\" force in Yugoslavia because an international team of 200 civilian observers had so far been unable to end the fighting. **********Dutch officials said the idea of the force was not to impose a cease-fire but rather to use a European show of arms to discourage a resumption of warfare after a new cease-fire goes into effect.

Brazil has already begun to make cash interest payments that will cover about $2 billion of its $8 billion in interest arrears, with the remainder of past-due interest to be covered once the country and banks agree on a broader debt package. **********Analysts expect the solution for Brazil to be somewhat similar to that worked out for other countries, where bankers have accepted a package that allows them to choose among making new loans, accepting a market rate of interest on a reduced amount of existing loans, or accepting a below-market interest rate on the existing loans. The packages also include various mixtures of United States Treasury zero-coupon bonds and financial assistance from international organizations to guarantee some principal and interest payments. **********Mr. de Graffenried, who speaks Spanish and Portuguese, is no stranger to the debt talks.

Analysts said the auctions would probably put upward pressure on short-term interest rates. **********An important reason these rates may rise is that the Treasury needs to drum up much more demand for the securities to be auctioned this week than it did earlier this month. **********The refunding auctions raised $19.5 billion in new cash.

The G.N.P. is the total value of goods and services sold. **********\"When we realized how deep a hole we'd dug ourselves into,\" said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, referring to inventory cutbacks, \"we realized we'd be digging out faster.\" **********Just as efforts by businesses to cut production when sales decline can snowball into a recession, attempts to keep shelves filled when sales start to revive can give the economy a powerful kick. As a matter of arithmetic, reducing inventories subtracts from G.N.P. growth while inventory building adds to growth. Even merely trimming at a slower rate gives the economy a lift. **********\"There's a legitimate concern that industry is in better shape in this recession than usual, just like services are in worse shape,\" said Stephen S. Strongin, associate research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. \"With one part of the economy in better shape than usual and one part worse, it depends on which you emphasize whether you worry about too much versus too little growth.\" **********Last week's rash of economic reports made the possibility that the economy might shift directly into high gear seem more plausible, though hardly certain. Businesses reported that inventories in April were unusually lean, amounting to 1.5 months worth of sales, compared with the typical 1.65 to 1.75 months. At the same time, retail sales jumped and car buying picked up a bit. **********Lean supplies and a pickup in sales make it more likely that businesses will trim inventories less in coming months. \"An inventory kick like that is enough to produce a surge of real income growth next fall and winter,\" said Art Rolnick, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \"That is especially true if inflation comes down, too. \" **********As business pumps up production, there should be gains in hours worked, payrolls and, consequently, income. If inflation edges down for a while, as it almost always does in the first months of a recovery, purchasing power would rise, too. **********A spurt at the start of the recovery does not imply a lasting boom. \"An inventory rebound doesn't last for more than a few quarters,\" Mr. Rolnick said. In other recoveries, economists at the First Boston Corporation report, the swing from inventory reduction to accumulation typically adds a percentage point to G.N.P. growth during the recovery's first year and almost nothing after that. **********Most of the forces that kept growth sluggish before the recession are still around, two examples being well-stocked consumers and a shrinking military industry. A Slower Pace **********\"You are likely to get the normal cyclical dynamics, but on top of a very slow trend, \" said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter. What is more, any speedy start now would be modest by the standards of past recoveries. At most, this rebound might start with a couple of quarters of 4 to 5 percent growth, not the high-single-digits pace registered immediately after some previous recessions. **********Fed officials hasten to add that a bouncy recovery is not being forecast by the Fed, though Mr. Greenspan said two weeks ago that \"the probability of a stronger-than-expected recovery is rising slightly.\" **********Mr. Strongin of the Chicago Fed said: \"This recession has a different structure going in, and the recovery has a different structure coming out. Charting its course is especially difficult.\" **********One of the biggest differences is that alert companies started paring inventories when recession began. In most other recessions, inventories kept piling up for at least one quarter before business brought production into line with slower sales. In the long and deep 1974-75 recession, for example, inventories rose for a year before companies cut production. **********At a forecasters' conference last September, Mr. Greenspan a former business prognosticator, argued that \"economic forecasting is really the art of identifying tensions and understanding how they will be resolved over the short to intermediate term.\" **********When the economy is changing direction, the tension between sales and stocks on shelves and in storerooms -- which no one except forecasters or managers ever think much about -- can provide clues to the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/business/wall-street-keeping-tabs-on-the-rascals.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 992, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; Keeping Tabs on the Rascals", "print_headline": "Wall Street; Keeping Tabs on the Rascals", "body_text": " **********Once again, it is time to look at Wall Street's dirty linen, the brokerage industry's disciplinary experience in 1990. It is a sobering pile, ranging from cheating on the broker's exam to outright theft. Even the major sins came in all sizes: One brokerage firm employee stole $312; several others pocketed a thousand times that amount. The humdrum miscreants who made unauthorized trades mingled with the creative souls who used forged paperwork to borrow money against customers' life insurance policies. **********While a few of the largest retail brokerage houses had some major explaining to do, those firms again experienced far fewer disciplinary cases, as a percentage of their work force, than their flimsier brethren. It was a thoroughly disheartening year for the quick-buck crowd, with regulators expanding their attention from penny stocks into areas like price gouging on Government bonds. **********One thing, unfortunately, did not change. It was still a year in which how much you learned about your broker's ethics depended on whom you asked. **********Brokerage firms, as a condition of the licenses they hold, are required to confess their sins on a regular basis, through forms filed with an automated data base called the Central Registration Depository. The depository is a joint project of the National Association of Securities Dealers and the North American Securities Administrators Association. There's the rub. **********The N.A.S.D. believes its members' confessions should be limited to closed cases and final results. State regulators believe the public should be told about pending accusations. Thus, brokers risk trouble with the state watchdogs if they omit pending cases, and face unflattering comparisons with less candid competitors if they include them. **********Difficult as this is for the industry, consider the poor customers. They write the N.A.S.D. to check on \"Pat Broker,\" who has just set up shop in town, and the association edits out pending cases and sends them a clean bill of health. (The association does not advise the customers of the editing; it also sends a copy of the customers' inquiry to the broker.) But if the same query were sent to, say, the securities regulators in Missouri, the customers might learn that state regulators have just filed a case charging good ole Pat with unauthorized trades. True, the charges may be found to be exaggerated or wrong; they may also be proven true -- long after Pat has collected new victims. **********That's the problem. Negotiators from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities dealers association and the state group met last week to wrestle with their differences. John R. Perkins, the Missouri securities commission and the new president of the state administrators group, said that, while the divisions are still deep, some progress was made. \"One of the biggest problems is coming up with a way to make it clear to someone that some of these are pending actions, to make the data more meaningful and more useful,\" he said. **********Any guess about when the talks might produce action? \"Both the S.E.C. and the N.A.S.A.A. consider this to be a fairly high priority item to be resolved,\" Mr. Perkins said. \"I hope that at least by next year we are ready to have a proposal to take to the commission.\" Which means, of course, that consumers of Wall Street's services are going to be stuck with the status quo for some time. But they can still learn a good bit about Wall Street's dark side. **********A query to the regulators' computer data base about the 10 largest retail brokers, as one might expect, will show that the largest firms -- Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Brothers -- had more new cases than their smaller rivals. That may be logical, considering their larger volume of business. But there were exceptions. Industry records show that A. G. Edwards of St. Louis is sixth in the retail-business rankings, but the firm reported no new cases last year and several smaller firms did. **********And anomalies abound. While Merrill and Shearson each reported six new cases, Merrill's records show that the firm paid just $10,000 in fines during the year, while Shearon was assessed more than $545,000 in fines and was censured twice. Prudential-Bache Securities reported only three cases -- but one resulted in censure and a $750,000 fine for serious record-keeping and supervisory lapses over several years. **********There are other data sources that can add texture to the careful customer's research. The major stock exchanges and the dealers association report regularly on their disciplinary actions, and those reports provide harrowing and occasionally hilarious details of life in the trenches of Wall Street. **********One aspiring broker was disciplined for writing notes on her palm before going in for her licensing exam. Dozens of brokers were punished for paying arbitration awards with checks that bounced. One busy young man forged orders to earn phony commissions. **********And several firms and 20 individual brokers in Little Rock, Ark., and Memphis, Tenn., were disciplined by the N.A.S.D. last year for selling mortgage securities and other fixed-income investments at \"unreasonable and unfair\" prices. **********But unfortunately, the most common sin revealed in the dealers association files remains the one that is most devastating to customers: the theft of customer funds. Of the 464 individual brokers across the country who were disciplined by the association last year, nearly 30 percent were sanctioned for simply pocketing their clients' money. In a heartbreaking number of cases, it was money that customers clearly could not spare. **********All of which helps put the regulators' debate over the standards of disclosure that should apply in the brokerage industry's data base in perspective. These well-intentioned partisans are trying to balance efficiency with usefulness, to weigh disclosure against embarrassment, to count the costs against the benefits. But for the customers who encounter the black sheep of Wall Street, the stakes are much, much higher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/29/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 7, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

[ Pages D7 and D16. ] Iraqi Effects Cited **********Analysts argued that the impact on world financial markets of Mr. Gorbachev's fall would be less than that from the Iraqi invsion of Kuwait just over a year ago, although major markets fell two, three or even seven times as far yesterday as they did the day after the invasion. **********Oil prices rose, but not nearly as sharply as they did a year ago. The price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed up $1.17, at $22.47 a barrel. Many economies, including the American, are on the verge of recoveries after the recession that began last year. And there is a belief that the crisis in the Soviet Union could lead to lower interest rates as governments try to make money more readily available to help limit the impact. **********The flight from stocks also helped ease the pressure in bond markets, another safe harbor for investors in time of trouble. The move to the United States was reflected in the drop of three-month Treasury bills below 5 percent yesterday for the first time since just after the stock market crash in October 1987. Bond markets in Europe and Japan also fared better than their stock markets. New Opportunities Seen **********And some analysts were looking at the sharp falls in many stock markets as new opportunities to buy quality stocks that are much cheaper than they were a week ago. **********Yet, the economies of many countries, including the United States, Britain and much of Continental Europe, are struggling to begin economic recoveries. In addition, before yesterday, many markets, including Germany's, had not even recovered all the ground lost in the Persian Gulf crisis. **********Some analysts said the latest jolt could trip up the economic recoveries. To have this impact, however, analysts say the Soviet upheaval has to dampen consumer and business confidence, a result that many do not expect unless the Soviet situation deteriorates significantly. **********\"The worry that stock markets were reflecting today was that the impact of what happened in the Soviet Union would somehow find its way through and slow down the incipient recoveries\" around the world, said Martin Paling, the international investment strategist for James Capel in London. **********\"But the only way for that to happen is through falling business and consumer confidence and that is very difficult to forecast,\" he added. \"The real problem is that at this time we haven't got enough to go on but there is a new element of risk.\" **********All financial markets are likely to continue to be volatile while the new hard-line Government moves to consolidate its control. But markets in the United States and in the Far East, are expected to be hurt less. They are farther away and have little trade or other economic relations that can be disrupted. **********The hardest impact is expected in Germany because of the Government's close role as a financial backer of Mr. Gorbachev; the threat of immigration because of the flight from countries bordering the Soviet Union and the presence of 372,000 Soviet troops in what was East Germany. Germany is also a major importer of natual gas from the Soviet Union. Plunge in Tokyo **********In Tokyo, where the stock market was already weakened by a series of stock and banking scandals, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks was already off about 360 points when the news of the coup arrived. In minutes it was down by 1,000 points and closed down 1,357.61, off 5.95 percent, at 21,456.76. It fell 1.92 percent the day after the Iraqi invasion. At midday today it was off 36.48, at 21,420.28. **********In Germany, the drop was more severe. The DAX index of 30 leading shares plunged 155.40 points or 9.40 percent, to 1,497.93, which exceded the first-day drop after the Iraqi invasion, which was 1.24 percent, and was the largest one-day drop since the small market crash of October 1989. **********Other stock markets falling in Europe included Britain, where the FT-SE 100 dropped 80.5 points, to 2,540.5, its largest one-day drop since October 1989; France, where the CAC-40 fell 132.77 points, to 1,687.54, and Italy, where the Milan Bourse index dropped 79 points, or 7.23 percent, to 1014. The markets in Spain, Switzerland, Beligum, Norway and Sweden also fell sharply. **********The dollar rose the most against the German mark because of the impact the Soviet coup could have on Germany. After jumping to over 1.83 marks to the dollar, the dollar ended in New York at 1.8235, up 3.34 percent on the day. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose only 0.57 percent, to 138.15, reflecting the expected smaller imact of the crisis in Japan. **********For the impact of the Soviet coup to change the economic foreces that are pushing the world's economy now there would have to be an abrupt slump in both business and consumer confidence. If this happened, like it did during the Persian Gulf crisis, spending by business and consumers would decline and the economy would slow. **********But many analysts do not expect this to happen. \"This crisis is localized,\" said Michael J. Howell, chief strategist for Salomon Brothers in London. \"It will have fewer ramifications for the global economy because the economic fundamentals on the near-term baisis are not that bad.\" He added that its impact should be more like that of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June of 1989 in China when the Government crushed the democracy movement. **********In the United States, Fabian Linden, the executive director of the consumer research center of the Conference Board, a business research group, said he expected no signficant impact on business or consumer confidence because the Soviet coup should not have the fallout of the Persian Gulf crisis. \"With the events in Iraq, we were deeply involved; there was talk of body counts and other dreary forecasts,\" he said. \"There was the impact on taxes, on inflation and on oil prices and the cost of driving to work. These were things that really hit home.\" **********But George Mangus, the chief strategist at S. G. Warburg in London, said confidence had been hurt, which, he added, meant that Europe, outside of Germany, \"could bounce along the bottom of this recession for considerably longer\" and that doubts about an American recovery could deepen. **********The big risks now, said Paul Feldman, global strategist at Goldman Sachs & Company in London, was that oil prices could rise, there could be \"blood on the streets\" in the Soviet Union; American investors could pull money out of European stocks and there could just be a long period of volatility. **********--------------------       HEAVY ASIAN SELLING **********TOKYO, Tuesday, Aug. 20 (Special to The New York Times) -- Asian financial markets, which were the first to react to the Soviet coup, were hurt on Monday by a heavy wave of selling by nervous investors from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. **********The huge Tokyo stock market fell almost 6 percent, while the Hong Kong stock market tumbled 8.4 percent. Stock markets in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur also took steep dives. **********Analysts suggested, however, that as the initial shock wears off, Asia may fare better than markets in the West. Asian economies, while vulnerable to any major shocks to the global political and economic system, generally have fewer direct ties with the Soviet Union, analysts said. **********\"There are some ominous signs here, but in the longer term I would rather be in Japan than Germany,\" said Peter Norton, head of research here for Baring Securities. **********The Soviet shock waves hit an already weakening market in Tokyo and jolted it into a near free-fall just after midday. A series of financial scandals and worries that the economy is slowing have sent the market lower here for weeks. **********The 225-stock Nikkei index was off about 360 points just before the first reports hit Japan. Minutes later, at 1 P.M. the index had fallen by about 700 points. At 1:04 P.M. the Nikkei average had dropped more than 1,000 points, or about 4 percent. **********The closing price of 21,456.76 on Monday, off nearly 6 percent, is close to what is considered the psychologically important 20,000 level. At midday today it was off 36.48, at 21,420.28. **********Mr. Norton of Baring Securities said much of the Monday selling came not from Japanese, but foreign investors worried about the impact of the developments in the Soviet Union. **********In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index had its sharpest decline since the Chinese Government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square two years ago. The index fell 340 points, or 8.4 percent, to 3,722. **********In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrial index tumbled 84.51 points, or 6.1 percent, to 1,309.23. Nearby, in Malaysia, the Kuala Lumpur index skidded 36.19 points, or 6.7 percent, to 505.47. **********--------------------       SHOCK IN EUROPE **********BONN, Aug. 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Soviet coup shocked Europe's financial markets today. Fearing a reprise of the cold war economic climate, investors sent stocks plunging while driving the dollar's value sharply higher in tumultuous trading. **********Economists said Mr. Gorbachev's removal and subsequent replacement by an emergency committee of Communist hard-liners might continue to roil financial markets until the situation in the Soviet Union stabilizes. Big losses on Wall Street would also weaken European share prices, despite the fact that the sudden change in the Soviet leadership was not seen endangering Western Europe's economic health. **********\"I don't see any great economic effect on Western European nations since their ties to the Soviet Union simply aren't that big.\" said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. \"There could be short-term disruption of Soviet trade, depending on developments. And the markets may suffer because fantasies about the potential for business in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe are really gone right now.\" **********Should the situation in the Soviet Union deteriorate, the broader consequences of Mr. Gorbachev's fall could include at least a temporary freeze in Western economic aid to the Soviet Union. \"There can be no money and know-how from the West for a return to totalitarian thinking,\" Germany's Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said. **********Many Western banks and businesses may share that view. They will immediately begin reassessing their strategies in the Soviet Union, said Jonathan Hoffmann, an economist with Credit Suisse-First Boston in London. **********Those factors helped drive prices sharply lower on Western Europe's major stock exchanges. The Frankfurt stock market was hardest hit, with the DAX index of 30 leading German stocks falling 155.40 points, to close down 9.4 percent at 1,497.93. It was the DAX's biggest one-day drop since October 1989 and prompted some comparisons with the global stock crash of October 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/world/soviet-turmoil-coup-gone-awry-behind-classic-soviet-failure-special-report.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1991-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3069, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Special Report", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL: A Coup Gone Awry/Behind a Classic Soviet Failure/A special report; GORBACHEV QUITS AS PARTY HEAD; ENDS COMMUNISM'S 74-YEAR REIGN: Plotters Who Had  Handcuffs But a Poor Sense of History", "print_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL: A Coup Gone Awry/Behind a Classic Soviet Failure/A special report; GORBACHEV QUITS AS PARTY HEAD; ENDS COMMUNISM'S 74-YEAR REIGN: Plotters Who Had  Handcuffs But a Poor Sense of History", "body_text": " **********The abortive coup that finally broke the Communist Party's grip on the Soviet Union was a spasm of desperate nostalgia by a committee of men who saw themselves as patriots of an endangered order. **********In its genesis and failure, it was the most Soviet of coups, the scheme of a gray collective against the new politics of the popular hero. **********The conspirators were so tuned to the plodding rhythms of the Five Year Plan that they thought to order 250,000 pairs of handcuffs from a factory in Pskov and preprint stacks of blank arrest orders, but neglected to detain the man -- Boris N. Yeltsin -- who would inspire the resistance. **********They failed because their bland collective offered neither the charismatic leadership of a Yeltsin nor the single-minded brutality of a Stalin. Plans for Assassinations **********Mr. Yeltsin asserted today that the collaborators had prepared a list of 12 men to be assassinated in the first half-hour of the takeover. Soviet newspapers, citing military sources, said airborne troops had been poised to assault Mr. Yeltsin's government stronghold at 2 A.M. Wednesday. But like decades of Soviet plans, these went unfulfilled, because of indecisiveness and internal division. **********The coup was foreshadowed by a year of intrigues, threats and premonitions, including a January assault on the separatist government of little Lithuania that looks in hindsight like a dress rehearsal for this week's events. **********Incredibly, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when he was interrupted at his Crimean dacha by the emissaries of the plot, had been working with another writer on a speculative article that included just such a scenario. He told reporters after his rescue that it involved the very conspirators who turned against him. Stranger Than Fiction **********But to Mr. Gorbachev, trusting in the men he had chosen and believing in the ultimate reasonableness of human behavior, it was merely a scenario, not a clear and present danger. **********\"My argument was that this would lead to the destruction of society,\" said Mr. Gorbachev, seeming more bemused by the shortsightedness of his captors than by their treachery. \"This would be a dead end.\" **********Muscovites, who thrive on conspiracy, have been smitten by the theory that Mr. Gorbachev helped organize his own overthrow, calculating that either it would succeed and he would return as a dictator, or it would fail and he would come home a hero. **********Members of the Russian delegation that flew to the Crimea to bring Mr. Gorbachev back after the coup collapsed said their suspicions had dissolved when they had seen the stricken looks on the faces of the Soviet leader and his family. **********Mr. Gorbachev's sin, they said, was not complicity but almost willful misjudgment of the men around him, whom he trusted more than his own public. **********Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of the independent Moscow newspaper Nyezavisimaya Gazeta, said that after what he called the \"putsch of fools,\" Mr. Gorbachev has been pushed to the periphery of his own revolution, a symbol of the legal power that was rescued by others. **********\"Evidently during the days of the putsch he was a victim, and for a time the halo of a victim will keep him on the surface,\" Mr. Tretyakov wrote today. \"But today we need him only to personify the resurrection of our constitutional order.\" The Plot That Failed **********Disorganization And Defections **********It is not known when the conspirators set their plan into motion, but it seems likely that things began to move around Aug. 6. On that day Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman announced Aug. 20 as the date for signing the new union treaty, which promised a radical decentralization of power to the republics. **********Confident in his new partnership with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev had left the previous weekend for his vacation home in the Crimea. **********By Friday, Aug. 16, the plan was unfolding. Komsomolskaya Pravda reported today that on that day a secret memorandum went out to K.G.B. field offices signed by Mr. Kryuchkov. It announced that all K.G.B. agents would have their pay immediately doubled. Two subsequent cables put the K.G.B. bureaus on alert and directed them to begin destroying documents. **********On Sunday, United States intelligence officials said, the Defense Minister, Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov flew to the Crimea, evidently to oversee security arrangements to detain Mr. Gorbachev. Even if true -- it has not been confirmed in Moscow -- the Defense Minister did not join the delegation that confronted Mr. Gorbachev. **********At 10 minutes to 5 that afternoon, Mr. Gorbachev says, he was told of unexpected visitors. When he picked up his phones to inquire, he discovered that all communications were cut off. Gorbachev Rebuffs the Emissaries **********Mr. Gorbachev said the emissaries from the junta were Yuri S. Plekhanov, the chief of security for the K.G.B., and Valery Boldin, the chief of Mr. Gorbachev's staff at the Communist Party Central Committee. Saying later that he indignantly rebuffed their demand that he voluntarily sign over emergency powers to the junta, Mr. Gorbachev began 72 hours of anxious isolation, accompanied by his family and loyal bodyguards. **********On Monday morning, somber announcements on television and radio informed Soviet citizens that they were under \"new leadership.\" Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the Speaker of Parliament, released a statement fiercely critizing the the union treaty and urging that it be postponed. **********With apparent ease, the conspirators managed to enlist, or silence, most of central Soviet officialdom. **********When Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov assembled the Cabinet on Monday night to solicit their approval, only three among the dozens of ministers present expressed reservations, according to notes kept by the liberal Environment Minister, Nikolai N. Vorontsev. **********His minutes record a typical reaction from Vladimir Gusev, head of the state committee on chemistry and biotechnology: \"If we step back even an iota, we will sacrifice our jobs, our lives. We will not have another chance.\" Signs of Disorganization **********The execution of the coup was limited to Moscow, Leningrad and the Baltics.  From the outset, it showed signs of disorganization. **********\"The first rule of a coup is isolate and control,\" said an American intelligence analyst who monitored the takeover from Washington. But this was not happening, he said. K.G.B. units designated for cutting key communications centers were not being deployed. **********Another mystifying mistake was the failure to detain Mr. Yeltsin, who flew back on Sunday from a trip to Kazakhstan and could have been easily detained at the airport. **********On Monday, military armor shuttled back and forth through Moscow, with no clear sign of an objective. **********Almost by sheer force of will, Mr. Yeltsin rallied the resistance. On Monday morning he stepped from his building -- as aides scanned neighboring buildings anxiously for snipers -- and climbed atop a hostile tank to declare his defiance for a gathering crowd of Muscovites. **********By the end of the day, three units sent to surround Mr. Yeltsin's \"White House,\" as it the Parliament building is called, had defected to the Russian government, including a battalion from the Tamanskaya Tank Division whose imposing armor now pointed in defense. Bus Drivers and Boatmen Help **********Trolley-bus drivers surrendered their vehicles to create makeshift tank barriers, Moscow River boatmen barricaded the river with their barges in case of a boat landing and volunteers from two private industrial security firms -- ex-policemen and army veterans who have found profit in the new Soviet freedom -- showed up to help secure the building. **********The Russian Parliament building became a hive of resistance, with a war room, a ham radio center, a printing press. On Tuesday Mr. Yeltsin managed to convene his Parliament in a session that became an inspiring show of legality amid the chaos of the putsch. **********As the conspirators wavered before the resistance, key politicians surfaced to support Mr. Yeltsin, including the leaders of the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. **********Still, as late as Tuesday night, Mr. Yeltsin's team and Western analysts feared that the junta would try to regain the momentum with a show of force. Gen. Konstantin I. Kobets, a member of the Russian Parliament, says that the Russian defense chief, three battalions of K.G.B. troops were to have led the attack on the Parliament building after midnight. **********But the only deaths in the coup were apparently unplanned: three civilians killed when a crowd tried to stop an armored vehicle on the Moscow ring road. Why Parliament Was Never Stormed **********There are conflicting versions of why the storming of the Russian Parliament House never took place. Mr. Gorbachev suggested that the K.G.B. officers refused, but provided no details. Two members of Mr. Gorbachev's National Security Council, Yevgeny Primakov and Vadim Bakatin -- now the post-coup K.G.B. chief -- asserted that the assault was stopped when they intervened with Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the chief of the general staff. **********From that point, the coup unraveled quickly. **********Gen. Yuri Yashin, a Deputy Defense Minister, told reporters that the 15-member collegium of the Defense Ministry had decided early on Wednesday morning to withdraw its troops. Marshal Yazov listened to the decision in a state of agitation, General Yashin said, and told his colleagues he wanted time to think over his next move. **********\"I got into this, and now I have to think about making a declaration on getting out of it,\" General Yashin said. Later in the day, Marshal Yazov, along with the K.G.B. chief and two other collaborators, flew to the Crimea to plead with Mr. Gorbachev for mercy. **********Mr. Gorbachev, following telephone advice from Mr. Yeltsin, refused to see them. **********\"When they came, I said put them in the house, put them under guard,\" the Soviet leader said upon his return. \"They'll have a long lifetime to think about it.\" The Military and the Police **********To Go Backward Was Their Desire **********A full reconstruction of the plot awaits months of investigation and trial, but to an astonishing degree the conspiracy coalesced in full public view. **********The pretenders to power were men who had made no secret of their alarm at the decline of centralized authority or their willingness to prevent it. They headed institutions whose power was vested in the old order of state ownership, central planning and the coherence of the union. **********\"The threat of the collapse of the Soviet Union has emerged,\" warned Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the chairman of the K.G.B., in a chilling televised statement last December, one of several public cries of anguish by future coup leaders. **********What was this threat? Ethnic separatists, free-market \"profiteers\" and ambitious political \"adventurists,\" whom Mr. Kryuchkov and his comrades saw as engaged in a Western-inspired sabotage of the Soviet state. Potential Danger Disregarded **********Mr. Gorbachev told his first post-coup news conference that he was generally aware of the potential danger in the state police agency but had selected and trusted Mr. Kryuchkov for the job because he was an apparatchik, \"less professional\" than the career spymasters and enforcers in the agency. **********The K.G.B. was the key to the one successful episode in the coup, the capture of Mr. Gorbachev. **********According to Mr. Gorbachev's own account, the conspirators only managed to penetrate his loyal 32-man security guard and deliver their ultimatum because one of the emissaries was Yuri S. Plekhanov, who as the K.G.B. security chief was formally superior to the palace guard. **********Another of the collaborators, Boris K. Pugo, had been the K.G.B. chairman in Latvia. Western Kremlinologists pegged him as more pragmatist than ideologue when Mr. Gorbachev promoted him to a key post overseeing Communist Party discipline in 1988, but since becoming Interior Minister last December he has been a voice of doom and decline. **********The Interior Ministry, responsible for maintaining public order, controls the troops used to put down ethnic violence, including the \"black beret\" anti-terrorist teams that have been deployed in the Baltic states. **********Mr. Pugo committed suicide on Thursday when authorities arrived to arrest him. **********In the early post-mortems since the coup, Soviet analysts have assigned a more ambivalent role to Marshal Yazov, whom Mr. Gorbachev plucked from obscurity in 1987 to make his Defense Minister. **********\"It seems to me that Yazov was sucked into a political game,\" said General Kobets, who led a battalion that helped put down Czechoslovakia's \"Prague Spring\" in 1968 and who this week directed Mr. Yeltsin's defenses. \"He does not want bloodshed. If he wanted, he could pulverize everything standing in the way of the armed forces.\" **********Marshal Yazov had been outspoken in defending the military's prestige during a period of cutbacks in the career officer corps, withdrawals from Eastern Europe and scornful slings of a liberated press. He has spoken bitterly against the Baltics and other independence-minded republics, where the army has been vilified as a symbol of imperial power. Division Within the Military **********At the same time, there is a strong reformist streak in the mid-level and junior officer corps, bent on repairing the army's image and professionalism and supportive of broader economic and political reforms in society. And conscripts deployed in Moscow by the Committee for the State of Emergency were admittedly uneasy in the role, even assuring civilians that they would not obey orders to shoot. **********The division in the military was a major factor in the failure of the coup, as mutinies by senior officers and some whole units undermined the conspirators' confidence in their ability to consolidate control. **********General Kobets, who worked on the general staff of the military until he was elected a member of the Russian Parliament last year, drew on his contacts to lure high-level defectors and maintain frequent contact with the military leadership. **********On Monday, Lieut. Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, commander of paratroopers, came over to Mr. Yeltsin's side, a decision rewarded on Friday with an extra star and the post of Deputy Defense Minister. Another, Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, commander in chief of the Air Force, who refused to support the coup, is the new Defense Minister. The Central Bureaucracy **********Cabinet Members Feared for Jobs **********But the men who had the most to win from the coup were not the police or military, but the custodians of the central Government. As Mr. Yeltsin pointed out presciently on the eve of the coup, the new union treaty Mr. Gorbachev was preparing to sign with Mr. Yeltsin and other republic leaders would almost surely have swept most of the Cabinet ministers from their jobs. **********Mr. Pavlov, the crew-cut Prime Minister, was a critical though reportedly weak-kneed member of the conspiracy; one Soviet newspaper reported that he spent much of the three-day putsch drinking and was so incapacitated that he had to be hospitalized. **********The most enthusiastic cheerleaders of the takeover were apparently the leaders of the defense industries, which have been in turmoil because of arms treaties and the loosening of central economic controls. Why 500-Day Plan Was Killed **********They were represented in the eight-man Emergency Committee by Oleg D. Baklanov, the Communist Party secretary in charge of the military-industrial complex, and Aleksandr I. Tizyakov, director of a missile factory in Sverdlovsk. **********Last October, the military-industrial complex played the principal role in persuading Mr. Gorbachev to abandon a 500-day economic reform package. They were in open panic at his recent return to the cause of radical change. **********The chief conspirators were linked by overlapping memberships in the Government's main security policy organizations, the Soviet Defense Council and Mr. Gorbachev's National Security Council. They also were part of a hard-line clique in the Communist Party's governing Central Committee and clearly hoped to use the party's surviving network as an instrument of control. The Disregarded Omens **********Ignoring Hard-Line Threat **********Mr. Yeltsin described the arrest of President Gorbachev last Sunday as \"the third attempt\" by the same cast of conspirators to halt the menace of democracy. That is perhaps putting it too strongly, but there is no doubt that Mr. Gorbachev had repeated omens of the danger confronting him and apparently chose to ignore them. **********Emboldened by their successful campaign to kill the 500-day reform plan last autumn, the hard-liners stepped up their pressure on Mr. Gorbachev, and he responded by trying to appease them. **********At a session of the Congress of Peoples Deputies last December, he named a colorless career Communist apparatchik, Gennadi I. Yanayev, to be his Vice President, a choice that stunned even his closest aides. **********Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was the first to sound the alarm. Frustrated that Mr. Gorbachev seemed to be letting the military undermine his efforts to negotiate new arms treaties with the United States, and angry that his longtime friend did not defend him against virulent public attacks from the old guard, Mr. Shevardnadze resigned in December with a stunning warning of encroaching dictatorship. **********Four weeks later, in what Mr. Yeltsin described as the first attempted coup, K.G.B. special forces, army paratroopers and \"black berets\" from the Interior Ministry struck in Lithuania and Latvia. They seized broadcast facilities and used them to announce the transfer of power to mysterious National Salvation Committees based in the headquarters of the Communist Party. Justification for a Crackdown **********Although Mr. Gorbachev professed innocence, Baltic hard-liners involved in planning the attacks say the Soviet leader gave general approval after Mr. Kryuchkov and others convinced him that Baltic separatism threatened the disintegration of the country. **********But when Lithuanians and Latvians rallied to defend their pro-independence governments, the Kremlin lost its resolve. What was to have been Moscow-backed coup in the two republics gave way to stalemate marked by sporadic violence. **********Another premonition of the Kremlin's fecklessness in the face of democratic insurgency came in March, when the Government called out 50,000 troops to prevent a pro-Yeltsin rally in central Moscow. The protesters came anyway, in the tens of thousands, and the troops made no move against them. **********What Mr. Yeltsin calls \"the second attempt\" against Mr. Gorbachev came in June when, without consulting the President, Prime Minister Pavlov asked the Soviet Parliament to give him additional lawmaking powers. At a closed parliamentary session, Mr. Kryuchkov, Mr. Pugo and Marshal Yazov all chimed in to endorse what the Soviet press described as an attempt to usurp the President. **********Four days later Mr. Gorbachev put down the mini-rebellion. Afterwards he appeared in the parliamentary lobby with Mr. Pugo, Marshal Yazov and Mr. Kryuchkov and joked, \"The coup is over.\" **********Interestingly, another supporter of that power grab was Mr. Lukyanov, the Speaker of Parliament and Mr. Gorbachev's friend since they attended law school together in the 1950's. **********Mr. Lukyanov was suspended this week amid allegations that he had served as \"the chief ideologist\" for the junta. Those who have worked closely with him say that in the week's events he was less an ideologue than an opportunist. **********Throughout this period of intrigues, Mr. Gorbachev allowed the hard-liners to keep their jobs. **********\"We saw it all,\" Mr. Shevardnadze recalled this week. \"We expected what is happening. Unfortunately, Mikhail Sergeyevich did not draw the necessary conclusions. All of this could have been prevented.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/business/bork-gets-chicago-job.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bork Gets Chicago Job", "print_headline": "Bork Gets Chicago Job", "body_text": " **********The Chicago Board of Trade has hired former Federal Judge Robert H.

Mr. Demirel was ousted in that coup, as he had been once before, in 1971. **********The election appears more likely to result in a shift by the Ankara Government away from the stongly pro-Western policies of Mr. Ozal and the conservative Motherland Party. Mr. Demirel, whose nationalist True Path Party took 180 of the 450 Parliamentary seats, is trying to hammer out a coalition with the left-wing Social Democrat Populist Party, which won 88 seats.  'Atmosphere Is Different' **********\"We are entering a political crisis,\" said Kamran Inan, Mr. Ozal's Minister of State and one of Mr. Demirel's fiercest critics. \"We are faced with enormous problems. We must assume a leadership role in the Middle East, the Balkans, Central Asia and beyond. We have economic difficulties and increased terrorism. We need a strong leader, but what we are getting is a man who prefers political survival over political stability.\" **********Mr. Demirel argues that Turkey has come too far to ever slip back into thepolitical violence of the years before the coup. **********\"The atmosphere of the country is different, quite different,\" the avuncular 68-year-old politician said, seated in his office in Parliament. \"The atmosphere of the world is different.\" **********For the last decade Turkey was dominated by the voluble and high-handed Mr. Ozal, who was appointed Prime Minister by the military in 1983 and oversaw the transition from military dictatorship, propelled the country toward parliamentary democracy and a market economy and gave unreserved support to the West, in particular the United States. During the Persian Gulf crisis, Turkey shut off the pipeline by which Iraq exported most of its oil and allowed American warplanes to make sorties against Iraq from Turkish soil. **********But the cozier President Ozal became with the West, the more he engendered disgust at home, and he was often attacked for his regal way of life and the wealth supposedly accumulated by his family. Mr. Demirel, during his campaign, promised to remove the President, \"his crown, his throne and all.\"  Taking Aim at Presidency **********Mr. Demirel says he is determined to strip the power of the presidency, which he argues is unconstitutional, and give it to the Parliament. He says the new Parliament will take up the legality of Mr. Ozal's election by Parliament to the newly created post of President in 1989. **********It would take a two-thirds majority to oust the President, and the new Parliament still has 113 members of the Motherland Party, enough to block such a move. **********But Mr. Ozal, whose term expires in 1996, seems to have thrown in the towel. \"The Ozal era is finished,\" he recently told a Turkish newspaper. \"I don't want any role from now on.\" **********In fact, the True Path Party and the Motherland Party have many policies in common. Mr. Demirel promised during the campaign to apply more strigent fiscal controls, to give the right to strike to public employees, to create a ministry for human rights and a national health-insurance system, to continue selling off state-owned businesses and to suppress leftist terrorist groups and the Kurdish guerrilla movement in the southeast. Kurdish Violence Is Up **********The Kurdish violence has increased in the last year. The rebels, who have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983, want a separate Kurdish state. **********Mr. Demirel has called for \"compassion\" in dealing with the Kurdish problem, telling Kurdish leaders that he will lift bans on publications in Kurdish. But on economic matters, Mr. Demirel's policies may be influenced by his coalition negotiations with a party whose distrust of market economics is only exceeded by its distrust of the United States. **********The Social Democrats opposed Turkish involvement in the Persian Gulf war and are calling for a halt to the privatization of the public sector, which constitutes about 40 percent of the economy, and the creation of new state enterprises. Austerity May Be Needed **********If he is to rein in the inflation rate, Mr. Demirel must convince the Social Democrats to endorse what could be an unpleasant austerity program, according to Western diplomats. **********There is a budget deficit of $6 billion and a foreign debt of $44 billion. And there is little likelihood that Mr. Demirel will ever begin to deliver on some of his more outlandish campaign promises, including one to give every Turk two keys, one for his car and the other for his house. **********The Social Democrats, moreover, are split by internal power struggles, and fell far short of their aspirations in the last elections. Most acknowledge that the process of economic and political reform, coupled with Turkey's drive to become part of the European Community, has advanced too far to be rolled back. **********\"We are part of Europe,\" Mr. Demirel said, \"and we should stay a part of Europe.\"  Western Diplomats Worried **********Some Western diplomats worry that Mr. Demirel, forced to bend to the Social Democrats, will find himself unable to introduce the economic reforms needed to prod the economy along. **********\"The economy needs some major tinkering with and another impulse of privatization,\" a Western diplomat said. \"What we fear is that things will just go on as they are with a few rhetorical statements.\" **********But for many Turks, for whom this is the third election since the military relinquished power, the democratic transition is in itself a victory, despite all their other worries. **********\"Forming a government is a means now, not a goal,\" Mr. Demirel said. \"The goal is what this government will do.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/business/saatchi-reports-progress-in-refinancing-bond-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1991-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saatchi Reports Progress In Refinancing Bond Issue", "print_headline": "Saatchi Reports Progress In Refinancing Bond Issue", "body_text": " **********Executives of the Saatchi & Saatchi Company said today that the ailing advertising company was making headway in its efforts to refinance a bond issue that could be converted in 1993. **********\"We are making progress,\" a Saatchi spokesman said.

Impasse at Trade Talks **********Lack of an agreement on a farm proposal helped bring an end to the world trade talks last year. The United States and some other farm exporters wanted the community to cut farm supports and eliminate export credits so that farmers in the United States could better compete with their European counterparts. **********But the community proposed less substantial cuts than the United States was looking for, and the four-year, 108-nation effort to lower world trade barriers collapsed. **********The plan announced today is an attempt to sever the link between production and guaranteed prices, which has encouraged farmers to grow more to earn more.

Farmers would be compensated for the big price cuts, with direct assistance geared more toward small- and medium-sized farmers. **********Farmers who are at least 55 years old would be eligible for a new early retirement program. **********The commission estimated the proposal would cost about $4.2 billion in its first year and less in subsequent years.

Shrinking real estate values in New England can cause bank stocks to fall on Wall Street. Deteriorating junk bonds on Wall Street can send insurance companies into bankruptcy in California. Declining prices at art auctions in New York can leave Tokyo tycoons short of cash. **********With that lesson in mind, two analysts at Fitch Investors Service, a Wall Street credit-rating agency, have spent a good part of the summer tracking the travels of weakening commercial aircraft loans. With unsold and unleased aircraft going begging, Nancy Stroker and Valerie Gerard suspect that many of those idle planes will ultimately be written down -- or written off -- with unhappy consequences for the profitability of the companies that financed them. **********Indeed, they warn, in a draft of a report to be released tomorrow, that airplane loans and leases are about to join third world debt, real estate lending and leveraged takeover loans as \"hot spots in the loan portfolios of financial institutions over the next several years.\" **********Of course, direct investments in commercial aircraft have been going sour for the past 18 months, as the airline industry's health has worsened and several leading carriers have filed for bankruptcy. **********Aircraft limited partnerships, the speculative investment pools set up to purchase airplanes and lease them out to carriers, have cut their dividends and declined sharply in value. Equipment trust certificates, which are publicly traded notes secured by specific airplanes, have also done a nosedive, and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of them have gone into default. **********The culprit has been an old-fashioned glut. There are too many aircraft for sale or lease at a time when air travel is down and ailing carriers are cutting back on their plane-buying plans. The partnerships that planned to pay dividends from lease income are finding their planes are unrented. Noteholders who thought they could recoup their principal by selling their airborne collateral are finding few buyers. **********Seeing all this, Ms. Stroker said, \"we began to wonder where the pain is going to be felt next.\" She added, \"So we decided to look at the finance companies that Fitch rates to see what we could find.\" **********What they found was that the aircraft trouble too had traveled: Commercial finance companies whose loan portfolios include significant levels of debt secured by aircraft are getting caught up in the dizzying collapse in aircraft prices. **********The companies, each of which has issued publicly traded debt or commercial paper that is rated by Fitch, include Chrysler Financial, Concord Leasing, Foothill Capital, General Electric Capital, Greyhound Financial, Household Finance, McDonnell Douglas Finance and Westinghouse Credit. All told, these units have issued about $45.2 billion in public debt; aircraft loans make up about $3.4 billion of their total portfolios. **********The analysts' first stop was at the used aircraft flea market itself, where they checked to see just how bad things are these days. Very bad, it turns out. \"Recent market activity has demonstrated an alarming 50 percent increase in the number of commercial aircraft available for sale or re-lease,\" the Fitch report says. There were 840 planes offered for buyers or renters in June, up from 545 at the end of 1990. **********\"Concurrently, there has also been a 50 percent decline in the number of actual completed transactions,\" the report continues. This suggests that the glut of commercial jet aircraft is likely to remain a fact of life for finance companies for some time to come. **********This trend is having the same effect on the value of finance company assets as the slump in auction prices is having on the estimated net worth of art collectors. Even conservative estimates of probable resale values now look dubious, at least for the short term, the Fitch report warned. **********If aircraft cannot be resold or re-leased, their owners face the same choices as any collector: to let the assets sit idle until the market recovers, to write the assets down to more realistic values or to retire the assets and not wait for a recovery. **********The result of each option, however, is likely to be that the companies Fitch examined will experience near-term increases in their nonperforming assets and in the related carrying costs, the analysts predicted. That, in turn, is likely to put pressure on those companies' profitability. **********The impact will be uneven, she said, depending on the amount of aircraft lending a company has done, and the age and condition of the various aircraft in its portfolio. **********The companies that are expected to feel the most impact going forward, the Fitch report says, are Chrysler Financial, a unit of Chrysler; Concord Leasing, a subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; General Electric Credit, the appliance maker's financial arm; McDonnell Douglas Finance, a unit of the aircraft builder, and Westinghouse Credit, part of Westinghouse Financial Services. Fitch notes that \"parent ownership and support\" for these subsidiaries could mitigate the damage \"in different degrees.\" **********Except for Concord Leasing, however, these same units are already feeling heat from two other hot spots in the financial community: commercial real estate and loans to heavily indebted companies, called \"highly leveraged transaction loans.\" So the worsening aircraft market simply turns up the voltage a bit, according to Fitch. **********But the aircraft glut is not yet likely to put pressure on those companies' credit ratings, the analysts said. \"Ratings are usually projected over a three-year period, and we perceive this glut to be a short-term problem,\" said Ms. Stroker. \"So we don't see a likelihood of any immediate rating changes. But we wanted to warn investors who have a shorter-term horizon that they may be incurring some short-term profitability risks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/15/world/soviet-crackdown-history-the-kremlin-revives-an-old-refrain.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1991-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 803, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Kremlin Revives an Old Refrain", "print_headline": "SOVIET CRACKDOWN: HISTORY; The Kremlin Revives an Old Refrain", "body_text": " **********The official Soviet explanation for the military intervention in Lithuania, belying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recent policies of glasnost, strongly resembles official explanations by his predecessors of the invasions of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Afghanistan in 1979. **********Mr. Gorbachev may have disavowed Stalinism and neo-Stalinism, but he has clearly not cured Soviet decision-making of its trademark reflex: to clothe the naked assertion of state power with Communist ideology, however transparent. **********So in the official explanations of what happened in Vilnius early Sunday morning, the Soviet Union did not say it had decided to use force to hold the country together against the separatist wishes of the Lithuanian parliament, even though it had been freely elected. It answered a call for help from a National Salvation Committee that nobody had heard of until last Friday. **********Consisting, apparently, mainly of Lithuanian and ethnic Russian Communists loyal to Moscow, the committee asserts, in the way the Communist governments in Eastern Europe used to claim, that it represents the true interests of the ordinary people better than an elected Parliament can. A Sense of Betrayal **********The sense of betrayal and disappointment, the heartsickness, that many people in this country feel at hearing such explanations by high-ranking officials over Soviet television Sunday night comes from their hope that Mr. Gorbachev had put that sort of manipulation of the truth behind them. **********What is different today is that, so far at least, the Soviet Army has not clapped the Lithuanian legislators in jail, arrested President Vytautas Landsbergis, or cut off international telephone and telecommunications links. They are, for the moment, still free to denounce Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet Army's actions, and international news organizations are still able to report what they see in Vilnius to the world. **********But the pattern, the reflex, is a familiar one. It got the Soviet Union into a bloody 10-year war in Afghanistan that Mr. Gorbachev now realizes is a mistake. On Dec. 27, 1979, Soviet troops helped install Babrak Karmal as the Afghan ruler, replacing President Hafizullah Amin in a coup. **********Probably after the fact, the Soviet Union said that it had acted in response to a request by the Afghan Government for help. President Amin, who had been installed only three months earlier, was denounced as a pro-American agent. Detente on the Rocks **********Later, Soviet officials with access to high-level thinking conceded that this was simply propaganda. The Kremlin acted, they said, because it looked at that point as though detente with the West was in for a rocky period anyway and it had little to lose by protecting its interests on its southern border. **********Mr. Karmal also did not last long. The damage to Soviet relations with the West did -- until well after Mr. Gorbachev came with his new policies and his seeming renunciation of Stalinist methods. Now his use of very similar methods, in a Baltic republic the annexation of which by Stalin in 1940 has never been formally accepted by the West, could cause similar lasting damage. Whether Mr. Gorbachev has resigned himself to this is not clear. **********He acquiesced to the loss of Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries from the Soviet bloc in 1989. But his Government's explanation of how it acted in Lithuania is much like the explanation made by the Government of Leonid I. Brezhnev as to why it sent troops and tanks into Prague in the summer of 1968 to put an end to the Communist reform leadership under Alexander Dubcek. **********Moscow said its troops moved into Czechoslovakia at the request of \"party and Government leaders of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic,\" after Pravda, the official Soviet Communist Party newspaper, warned that the Czechoslovak leadership was \"losing control\" of the situation -- just what Soviet authorities now are saying about President Landsbergis in Lithuania. Fate of Dissidents **********Mr. Dubcek and his colleagues were flown off to Moscow, interrogated and sternly warned, and returned to Prague for a short while before being replaced by more orthodox and obedient Communist functionaries and disgraced. **********Mr. Dubcek, unlike the Hungarian leader Imre Nagy, lived long enough to make a comeback when his country returned to democracy in 1989. Mr. Nagy, who tried to take his country out of the now defunct Warsaw Pact in 1956, was swept out of power by Soviet tanks that November. The Soviets installed a new \"revolutionary worker-peasant government\" led by Janos Kadar, acting, of course, at its request. Mr. Nagy was subsequently taken to Romania and executed. **********No one now seriously believes that Mr. Gorbachev would countenance a return to such crude methods.

Asked what that was worth to CNC, he replied, \"In my view, it is worth less than $2 per share, a lot less.\" But Mr. Cole said CNC, which owns 2,000 small retail stores in the gift and optical businesses, would benefit from severing its links to Child World, which have included some cross-guarantees of debt. **********The prospective buyer of Child World is a newly formed company headed by two former officials of Toys \"R\" Us, the No. 1 toy retailer, and financed by institutional investors whose identities were not disclosed. **********W. John Devine, one of those executives, said negotiations were under way with Child World's banks, which are owed $135 million, and its toy suppliers, which are owed $190 million. He said the company would offer a combination of cash and notes, and perhaps some stock. \"They will come out whole, ultimately,\" he said of the creditors. **********For Child World's public shareholders, the newest deal is a huge step down from the previous one, which was announced last July and collapsed in November. That deal called for a partnership led by Roy Disney's Shamrock Holdings to buy the public shares at $14 each. **********In that deal, CNC was also to get no cash, instead receiving bonds that First Executive had agreed to accept to cancel some of CNC's debts. Mr. Cole said First Executive would cancel less debt under the new agreement than in the first deal. First Executive officials did not return telephone calls. **********Mr. Cole took Cole National private in a 1987 leveraged buyout, leaving it saddled with large debts, including some on which cash interest must begin to be paid next month. Asked about that payment, Mr. Cole responded that \"the probability of our making it is low,\" but said that he believed a bankruptcy filing could be avoided while the company sought to restructure its debt. **********To function, a toy retailer needs credit. \"The banks and the trade are very positive about the new prospective buyers, and seem to be willing to finance them going forward,\" Mr. Cole said, \"whereas there has not been a lot of willingness to finance Child World with the existing CNC ownership. We kind of wore out our welcome.\" Child World suspended payments to toy suppliers in early December. It is now paying its smaller bills, but not its larger ones. **********Yesterday's announcement said that the WC Acquisition Corporation had signed a letter of intent to buy CNC's stake, and that \"as promptly as practicable\" after that stake is bought, public shareholders would be offered $2 a share. Mr. Devine said he hoped that would occur within two months. **********There are only two million shares in public hands, so the total cash outlay for the shares will be only $24 million to control a company with annual sales of more than $800 million. **********Besides Mr. Devine, the other principal in WC Acquisition is Ronald E. Tuchman, 55 years old, who left Toys \"R\" Us in 1989 to join an unsuccesful effort to acquire the Lionel Corporation, which operates Kiddie City, the No. 3 toy retailer. He is now an executive of Toy and Sports Warehouse, a chain of five stores that he said might be merged into Child World. **********Mr. Devine, who retired from Toys \"R\" Us is 1983 at the age of 43, said he was re-entering the toy business at the age of 50 in part because his real estate investments had not worked out as well as he had hoped. **********But he added, \"I am now caught up in the challenge\" of turning Child World around. \"There is so much that can be done here,\" he said. \"If the company even begins to approach the profitability of Toys 'R' Us, there are great opportunities.\" **********It was those opportunities that led public shareholders to buy Child World shares, paying nearly $20 a share as recently as 1989. But Mr. Devine said no thought had been given to allowing those shareholders to hang on, hoping that the new management would do better. **********And $2 a share is much better than what might have been. Some of the takeover offers for Child World \"did not include anything for the shareholders,\" Mr. Cole said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/04/business/business-digest-524091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********International **********A casualty of the Soviet Union's political and economic chaos has been American enthusiasm for investment there.

Brown Inc. and Piper Jaffray Inc. all reported sharply higher earnings. **********Like many other Wall Street firms that are reporting successful quarters, the four took advantage of stock and bond market rallies in the first quarter to earn significant trading profits. But, for the most part, investment banking fees, in mergers and corporate finance, remained weak. **********\"The industry is definitely not covering all the bases yet,\" said John Keefe, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. But he said that the soft spots \"were completely overshadowed by the strong trading results. **********Following are the results of the four financial concerns:  Morgan Stanley **********Morgan Stanley yesterday reported earnings of $120.1 million, or $3.07 a share, in the quarter just ended, compared with $82.1 million, or $2.07 a share, in the first quarter of last year. **********Revenues for the quarter also grew. Revenues for the period were $1.6 billion, up from the $1.4 billion it reported in the first quarter of 1990. **********Richard B. Fisher, Morgan's chairman, said in a statement that the results stemmed in part from strong trading revenues in almost every business. \"Revenues during the period benefited from the continued strong performance in our global sales and trading activities, particularly in fixed income, equities, foreign exchange and commodities,\" Mr. Fisher said. **********The company's investment banking revenues totaled $187 million for the quarter, up from $162.2 million in the first quarter of 1990. Morgan attributed the growth in investment banking to increased underwriting volumes in both the debt and equity markets, which it said offset a decline in the financial advisory business. **********Morgan closed at $87.375 yesterday, up 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.  Salomon Inc. **********Salomon yesterday reported record earnings of $273 million, or $2.30 a share, in the quarter just ended, compared with earnings of $119 million, or 88 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1990. Revenues for the quarter were $2.69 billion, up from the $2.35 billion in the first quarter of 1990. **********Salomon Brothers, the company's brokerage subsidiary, reported sharply higher earnings before taxes. The firm earned a record $503 million before taxes, more than double the $227 million earned before taxes in the first quarter of last year. **********Revenues less interest expenses, increased to $1.1 billion in the first quarter, up 70 percent from the $669 million in the first quarter of last year. **********Salomon said that the strong performance of its brokerage subsidiary \"was primarily attributable to excellent trading results across virtually all products and geographic areas.\" **********Trading revenue increased to $968 million, up from $658 million in last year's first quarter. Commissions also rose, up 20 percent, to $60 million, compared with $50 million last year. Investment banking revenues also increased moderately, to $99 million from $84 million. **********The improvement at the full company was achieved without much of a contribution from Phibro Energy Inc., Salomon's oil refining and trading operation. Phibro, which has long been a source of financial stability for Salomon, reported pretax earnings of $5 million in the quarter, down from $7 million a year ago. **********Salomon's shares rose $1.50 yesterday, to $32.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Alex. Brown Inc. **********Alex. Brown, based in Baltimore, yesterday reported record earnings of $10.6 million, or 71 cents a share, up from $2.5 million, or 16 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. The firm also reported record revenues for the quarter of $93.6 million, up 37 percent from the $68.5 million in revenues in the comparable period in 1990. **********Revenues increased across the board. But the firm was unusual in reporting strong growth in investment banking revenues, which rose to $28.7 million in the first quarter, up 41 percent from the $20.3 million reported in the first quarter of 1990. **********\"The firm that has the most to be proud of is Alex. Brown,\" said Mr. Keefe of Lipper. \"They had the biggest pickup in investment banking revenue.\" Much of that pickup was related to the firm's strong performance in underwriting equity offerings, particularly in the new issue market. **********The firm also reported a strong increase in its retail and institutional businesses, leading to a 36 percent rise in commission revenue compared with the first quarter of last year. Trading revenues also increased, more than doubling the revenues from the comparable period last year. **********Alex. Brown fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $18.125, in over-the-counter trading.  Piper Jaffray Inc. **********Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis-based regional brokerage, reported quarterly net income of $4.65 million, or $1.13 a share, more than double the $2.11 million, or 52 cents a share, of a year earlier. Piper Jaffray revenue was $63.3 million, up 28 percent from $49.5 million a year ago. **********Piper Jaffray rose 50 cents, to $22, in over-the-counter trading."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/09/business/recovery-gasps-for-new-orders.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1991-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1395, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Recovery Gasps for New Orders", "print_headline": "Recovery Gasps for New Orders", "body_text": " **********The Will-Burt Company, a parts maker in Orrville, Ohio, senses the beginnings of an economic recovery. Various customers -- a nearby Volvo truck factory, for example, and AMF Bowling Inc. -- are purchasing a few more fenders, doors, bumpers and finely machined parts. As the pace picks up, Harry E. Featherstone, Will-Burt's chief executive, finds himself with a week's supply of steel. But he wishes the stockpile were smaller. \"I'd like to order steel daily,\" he said. **********Such thinking helps to explain why the heralded recovery from the recession is having trouble getting off the ground. Much depends on whether Mr. Featherstone and thousands of other American executives conclude, more or less simultaneously, that sales are again brisk enough and sustained enough to warrant restocking. When they do, economists say, the jump in production needed to satisfy the surge in new orders will give the economy a kick out of recession.  Not This Month **********\"There will come a moment when people will decide that they don't have enough in their warehouses,\" said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton. \"But that moment has not arrived yet.\" **********Almost certainly it will not arrive before Labor Day, interviews with executives, industry experts and economists indicate. Across many industries, sales are indeed rising, but many of those interviewed said they lacked confidence that any improvement would endure. What is more, even if they become confident, summer is the worst of times to fire up a recovery through inventory rebuilding. **********Retailers, for example, normally postpone major apparel orders until late August while they test the appetite for the new fall styles with pre-season sales. Most major chain stores reported yesterday that July sales of summer goods were listless.  [ Page D2. ] **********Similarly, auto sales have clearly outstripped production in recent weeks, but in July and August manufacturers phase out one year's models and begin to make the new lines. While they do so, production is held below par. Then, before setting new production schedules, auto makers must gauge the demand for 1992 models, said Joel Pitcoff, an analyst at the Ford Motor Company.  Just-in-Time Strategy **********Finally, the American economy faces an obstacle in this incipient recovery that did not hinder stockpiling after previous recessions. A surge in orders would undoubtedly prompt Mr. Featherstone's company to stockpile some steel. Nevertheless, he and many others are becoming increasingly adept at the new strategy of just-in-time delivery: moving products quickly from the factory to the customer, with the shortest possible stay in a warehouse. **********Mr. Featherstone, for example, notes that Caterpillar Inc., a big customer, has eliminated a 500,000-square-foot warehouse in Aurora, Ill. \"They want us to hold their inventories and make shipments to them weekly and even daily,\" he said. \"But we are also going in the direction of not holding costly inventories.\" **********Because of the recession, thousands of American companies took to selling from their existing stockpiles, rather than ordering new merchandise they might not have been able to sell. They have lived largely off their stockpiles for nearly nine months now, although the liquidation rate has fallen lately, the Commerce Department reports. Selling from inventory rather than making new merchandise contributed to the recession.  Companies Still Liquidating **********Now, with sales somewhat improved, production is beginning to rise as companies cautiously reorder. The big question, though, is whether the new production will increase to the point that the selling from stockpiles finally ceases in this third quarter. If so, that would be enough to end the recession, economists say. **********\"You don't need a vigorous restocking to drive the recovery,\" said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. \"All you have to do is stop liquidating.\" **********But many of the executives and industry experts interviewed did not think the inventory liquidation would end before the fourth quarter. And recent surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business, representing small companies, and the National Association of Purchasing Management, representing mostly major corporations, suggest a similar conclusion. In both surveys, substantial percentages of companies said they were still liquidating their inventories.  Gillette Cutting Inventory **********At the Gillette Company, liquidation is likely to remain the order of the day until October, said Milton L. Glass, the company's vice president for finance. Nevertheless, since June, Gillette has been selling more razors and razor blades to retailers. The retailers' inventories had fallen too low to meet the demand from consumers, and for two months retailers have been restocking, Mr. Glass said. But Gillette itself is not. Quite the contrary, it is selling to retailers from its own factory inventories, without increasing production. **********\"Our inventories had built up in April and May, and in June they were on the high side,\" Mr. Glass said. \"Now, we are switching them to the retailers.\" **********Like many of their compatriots, Gillette executives remain skeptical about how long the stronger orders from retailers will last. \"You are going to have to wait until October before you can say whether there is a genuine consumer-led recovery or this increase in retail orders is just a flash in the pan,\" Mr. Glass said. Commerce Department Data **********Some economists optimistically pin their hopes of a production surge on Commerce Department data that show inventories nationwide to be at an unusually low level -- 3.01 months of stocks on hand if production stopped dead today and sales continued at their current pace. That is a decline from 3.06 months last year, on the eve of the recession. **********But while inventories nationwide might be very low, the Commerce Department figures can obscure some important variations. While some major industries are still selling from stock, others are not. Sales of household appliances, for example, have risen sharply and, with inventories lean, production has shot up. Such production increases, in turn, prompt companies to rehire workers or pay more in overtime, and those new wages help pump up the economy. **********The steel industry, however, built up stockpiles early this year, partly in anticipation of a strike at the USX Corporation that did not materialize. Sales then fell, leaving manufacturers and distributors with too much on hand, which has suppressed production, said Walter Carter, a steel industry specialist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm. **********\"We are still in the relatively early stages of reducing the stockpile,\" he said, adding that the rest of 1991 might be spent in trimming away two million tons of stored steel products. Some Industries Holding Back **********Some industries with lean inventories nevertheless prefer to hold back production until short supplies drive up prices. That is the case among makers of linerboard, the heavy cardboard-like material used to make shipping cartons. Linerboard stockpiles are down to less than six weeks' supply, said Timothy McKenna, a spokesman for the Union Camp Corporation, a major maker of linerboard. But the priority is to get the price toward where it was last January: $370 a ton, compared with $320 today. **********Other, less tangible factors are also discouraging the inventory rebuilding that played a major role in recoveries from past recessions. One is low inflation. Companies stockpiled in the past to avoid paying much higher prices for raw materials, parts and finished goods a few months later. Inflation today, however, is running at a low annual rate, under 3 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. **********\"No one is tempted to buy in anticipation of price increases,\" said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization. \"This failure to restock in turn helps to keep prices down.\" **********Imports are also a much greater source of inventories than a decade ago -- a trend that pushes up production abroad but not at home. **********\"With production now globalized, companies can 'outsource' overseas as well as domestically,\" Richard B. Berner, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in a recent article. \"As a result, imports now substitute for domestic inventories.\" **********Finally, the credit crunch inhibits stockpiling. Keeping 10,000 pairs of shoes on hand means a retailer must borrow money to buy the shoes and store them until they can be sold to consumers, and then repay the loan. Bankers themselves say they are more cautious than they were in the 1980's about providing such financing. That caution has meant, for example, that the shoe manufacturer and the economy are often deprived of the wealth that comes from producing the extra shoes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/business/company-news-briefs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Ashland Oil Inc., Ashland, Ky., said its Scurlock Corp. subsidiary would sell its Corpus Christi, Tex., marine terminal, as well as other pipelines and oil-gathering systems, to Koch Industries Inc., Wichita, Kan.

Shechtman wrote that many workers in their 20's and 30's are still adolescents emotionally and are less productive than the workers of other generations. **********He said managers should be prepared to deal with their young workers in the same way they treat their teen-age sons and daughters at home. By using a strategy of \"re-parenting,\" he said, companies may be able to increase self-absorbed workers' productivity to acceptable levels within two or three years instead of the six or seven years that might be required otherwise. **********Here are some of the letters received in response to Mr. Shechtman's advice. **********Dated Practices **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Shechtman's premise that a significant number of working people in their 20's and 30's are \"adolescents emotionally\" and should be \"re-parented\" is exactly the kind of thinking that has helped to create the relatively dismal competitive posture of many United States businesses today. **********The advice Mr. Shechtman dispenses -- do not tax employees' attention spans, do not give out more than one task at a time and do not accept any exceptions to the rules -- reeks of dated management practices that have proved highly ineffective for today's fiercely competitive business environment. Following are examples: *********** The principles espoused by the scientific-management pioneer Frederick Taylor, who recommended keeping tasks very simple and straightforward and giving simple directions so there was no room for human error. Workers' reaction to this management philosophy led to the rise and spread of the American labor union movement. *********** The paternalistic, we-know-what's-best-for-the-kids style of management. The response by employees and children to this style is \"Well, if Mom and Dad know what's best for us, then we will wait for them to tell us what to do.\" This treatment by management yields a dependent, lethargic, stagnant work force. *********** The \"command and control\" theory of management, which says the managers are the experts and will make the rules and create the directives for everyone else. This philosophy creates status barriers, low commitment and a lack of motivation to perform. **********In my 13 years as a management consultant, I have encountered many emotionally immature employees in their 20's and 30's. But I have also worked with just as many, if not more, employees in their 40's, 50's and 60's who are emotionally crippled because of their insatiable need for power, control, status and stability. Stereotyping segments of the work force puts people in boxes, which are very difficult to get out of. **********Given the strenuous demands, conflicting priorities and scarcity of resources that managers have to deal with today, re-parenting is not a legitimate job responsibility. Managers who are expected to watch the bottom line, delight the customer, facilitate technological breakthroughs and serve as quality gurus do not have the time or patience to develop the emotional acumen of the work force. **********Building a competitive, flexible, talented work force can be accomplished only by treating all employees, regardless of age, like adults. In an adult work world, business must do the following things: *********** Insure the right fit between employee and job content. If an employee does not have the skill and ability to perform the job, train him or her. If the employee is not trainable, someone made a mistake in hiring. *********** Set realistically high performance expectations for everyone and ratchet up those expectations as performance improves. *********** Allow all employees freedom to make decisions about the shape, content and context of their work. *********** Encourage employees to \"grow the job.\" As market needs shift and change, so should employees and their job. **********If employees of any age are treated like children, they will respond and perform like children. If employees are treated as mature rational adults, they will respond and perform like mature rational adults. DIANE RIGGAN  Norwalk, Conn., Nov. 19    The author is president of Riggan & Associates, a management-consulting firm.   Insulting and Demeaning **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Shechtman suggests that to increase productivity among young workers, managers should use \"strategies not unlike those that you use at home with your teen-agers.\" Such a recommendation is insulting and demeaning to young workers and will only worsen a productivity problem that many managers unknowingly cause in the first place. **********Today's young workers are collectively more educated than the young employees of previous generations, and they consequently have more confidence in their abilities and greater career expectations. **********Unfortunately, many managers waste this young talent and ambition by providing recent college graduates with unchallenging and unstimulating tasks that require doing, but not thinking. This produces boredom and dissatisfaction, which cause the productivity and motivation problems that Mr. Shechtman erroneously attributes to \"adolescent traits like self-absorption, lack of commitment and short attention spans.\" **********If you want to improve the productivity of your young employees, treat them as you would your more senior personnel. Establish challenging, yet attainable goals. Provide young workers with responsibility and the commensurate authority required to meet objectives. And create a supportive atmosphere that encourages learning and initiative. **********Indeed, young workers will rise above their expected performance levels if their work is interesting and the career prospects are encouraging. That is the key to productivity; re-parenting is not. LAURENCE PLAWSKY  Plainview, L.I., Nov. 20  Lowering Expectations **********To the Editor: **********As a recent college graduate who has held several temporary jobs in the past six months, I realize I am expected to be mature and responsible on the job, no matter what it is. **********Companies do not lower their expectations or make allowances because of my \"prolonged adolescence.\" Instead, I am given projects, brief instructions and advice as to their completion and then turned loose. Often the feedback is minimal or nonexistent, as completing the projects is fulfilling my obligation as an employee. **********Admittedly, my living away from home with partial parental support has forced me to grow up quickly and lose the \"work as play\" attitude pervasive among many people my age. Pavement pounding and interviewing taught me that employers want employees who are willing to work, learn and carry out assigned tasks with little or no feedback, not employees who need or want baby-sitting. **********I believe Mr. Shechtman's suggestions on how to \"raise\" young workers will only encourage and prolong adolescent behavior and attitudes among young staff. By lowering their expectations of young workers, companies are effectively lowering the expectations they have for themselves. **********If a project requires three people three days to complete, it should take no longer. Employers should not break up meetings and projects for the benefit of their young staff but should instead expect their young employees to adapt to their management styles, not vice versa. **********The strategies Mr. Shechtman suggests will cause rifts within the office, as older employees may resent supervising and babying young employees who require constant feedback. Older employees who have been with a company for more than 10 years often do not wish to slow productivity so they can explain tasks and provide feedback. **********Young employees should realize that much of what is done in offices is thankless and goes unrecognized unless done badly or incorrectly. If feedback or advice is needed, the employee should be encouraged to seek answers either through his or her own research or by asking a senior employee. **********I do not expect to be \"re-parented\" in my job. Instead, I expect to be treated as a young adult who wishes to grow in a company and will fulfill expected duties. GILLIAN E. COX  Boston, Nov. 17  Behavioral Triage **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Shechtman addresses one of the most important aspects of our steady economic decline: the prolonging of adolescence and its damaging consequences in work and business. **********But the strategies given for dealing with this problem are pathetic. In effect, Mr. Shechtman suggests that corporations must act as a sort of day-care center, patiently coaxing productivity out of people who despite their advanced education and degrees are little more than spoiled children. **********This is not a cure and it does not address the cultural source of this problem: the \"entertainmentization\" of America. What good does it do to perform behavioral triage on workers of all levels when television and movies continue to promote irresponsible adolescence as an ideal state of existence? **********As Neil Postman pointed out in \"Amusing Ourselves to Death,\" the power of entertainment has infected many aspects of American life. Its most damaging aspect is on the American character: our addiction to image over substance, our susceptibility to slogans over reasoning, our simple-minded pursuit and adulation of shallow \"heroes.\" **********Until those who wield the economic power in America come to realize that they have a greater responsibility for the larger society than for improving the performance of their companies' stocks, they will find their resources incapable of stemming the tide of immature workers, ethically blind workers, unproductive workers, illiterate workers, substance-dependent workers -- and all of those whose characters are currently being crafted by the massive power of the amusement media and who are the potential workers of the next century.

Country after country in Latin America declared interest in free trade with the United States -- and six have signed bilateral or multilateral \"framework agreements\" with Washington providing for regular discussion on key issues. The proposal has also reinvigorated existing trade pacts throughout Latin America; prompted Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to work toward a common market, and spurred other nations to begin free-trade talks.

He was then taken away to the maximum security prison, by one account. **********Col. Elias P. Ramaema replaced General Lekhanya as chairman of the six-member Military Council, according to unofficial reports confirmed by a South African diplomat here. Colonel Ramaema served on the council that has ruled Lesotho since Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan was overthrown in January 1986. **********The naming of a successor was reportedly delayed by disagreement among rebel officers over whether General Lekhanya should be replaced by another military officer or by Lesotho's current constitutional monarch, King Letsie III. **********In a radio interview today with the South African Broadcasting Corporation, Evastius Sekhonyana, a former Finance Minister of Lesotho, said the general had been told \"in very strong terms\" on Monday night that he and some other Cabinet ministers had to resign. Mr. Sekhonyana said he did not know who had carred out the coup. **********General Lekhanya, a 54-year-old career policeman, took over Lesotho in January 1986 at the head of a junta pledged to eliminate corruption. He subsequently stripped away the powers of King Moshoeshoe and forced him into exile in February 1990, replacing him with his son, now King Letsie, who has no executive authority. **********Last year, the general promised to return civilian rule to Lesotho (pronounced Le-SOO-too) by June 1992 but had not begun any arrangements to do so. There had been increasing complaints about his tenure, prompting the South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and President Sam Nujoma of Namibia to cancel scheduled visits in recent weeks.Mike Taole, general secretary of the Christian Council of Lesotho, told the South African Press Association that the uprising against General Lekhanya's rule began Monday morning, when some military units went on strike for higher pay.

President Is Optimistic **********\"It doesn't change the outlook very much -- and might even improve it,\" said Robert H. Chandross, the chief economist for Lloyds Bank North America in New York. **********President Bush, when asked in Kennebunkport, Me., whether today's report meant continued recession, said he did not think so. \"I feel all right about things,\" he said. \"There are some statistics up and some down, but basically I think it's doing all right.\" **********Most reports on economic activity so far this summer have portrayed an economic rebound, and even skeptics regard growth in G.N.P. for the third quarter to be a near certainty. A number of analysts said they did not expect the Federal Reserve to relax monetary policy further in response to today's revisions of the spring-quarter performance. **********Traders in the financial markets, however, grasped at the prospect that signs of economic weakness might yet mean a new cut in interest rates by the Fed, which also trimmed rates earlier this month to give the economy a lift. That hope helped to inspire the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 29.07 points to reach a new high of 3,055.23.  [ Page D8. ]  The G.N.P. report, coupled with a successful auction of new five-year Treasury notes, also helped to push up prices for Treasury securities in the credit market.  [ Page D18. ] Shattering an Illusion **********A minority of private analysts pointed to the latest G.N.P. figures as evidence of lingering weakness that to some implies no significant growth until next year. **********\"Today's downward revision of the second-quarter G.N.P. should shatter any remaining illusion of an economic recovery,\" said Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. \"This third consecutive quarter of economic contraction removes all doubt about the continuing economic stagnation.\" **********A prominent reason for caution, some analysts say, is a wavering of confidence among consumers, the source of two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The ABC News/ Money Magazine Consumer Index was calculated today at minus 38 on a scale ranging from plus 100 to minus 100. The index, based on consumer ratings of the economy, consumers' personal finances and the buying climate, is down one point for the week and within five points of its record low of minus 43, set on Oct. 28. **********Albert Sindlinger, a longtime pollster, said today that consumer incomes had slumped to a 36-year low, in part because of taxes not included in Government inflation statistics. Depleted Inventories **********The main factors dragging the G.N.P. into negative territory were more rapid reductions in business inventories and lower personal spending. Analysts noted, however, that depleted inventories represent a positive factor for gauging future economic activity, since any increase in demand will quickly require stepped-up production. **********\"This sets up the possibility of significant economic growth in the second half of the year,\" said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist a Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Businesses cut inventories at a $27.7 billion rate in the April-June quarter instead of the $21.2 billion pace initially estimated, a difference of $6.5 billion, the Commerce Department report showed. **********Analysts also tended to playdown the $5.1 billion downward revision in personal spending, which shrank the annual growth rate to 2.8 percent from 3.6 percent. Much of the reduction reflected what were, in effect, accounting changes that shifted car purchases from individuals to businesses.  Daunting Task for Auto Makers **********Even optimists, however, cautioned that the automobile business faced a daunting sales task in coming months, since it has imposed significant price increases that exceed current rebate programs. **********The biggest upward revisions in today's G.N.P. report were a $4.1 billion improvement in foreign trade -- imports were $3.1 billion lower than first estimated and exports $1 billion higher -- and a $3.4 billion rise in the output of producers' durable equipment. **********Over all, analysts said that while they did not consider the half-point revision in G.N.P. to be large, it was somewhat surprising that it was downward and into negative territory. Based on experience, the department said the chances were two out of three that in the future, revisions of second-quarter G.N.P. would not be worse than a four-tenths of 1 percent rate of decline or better than a five-tenths of 1 percent rate of advance. **********The G.N.P. declined at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1991 and 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  Inflation at 3 Percent **********Inflation, as gauged by the fixed-weight G.N.P. price index that assumes the composition of output does not change, ran at 3 percent during the quarter, the same pace as estimated in late July. The nation's savings rate, however, is now seen as remaining at 4.2 percent instead of falling a half point as initially estimated in July's advance report. **********G.N.P. in current dollars rather than 1982 dollars fell to a 4.2 annual percent rate of increase in the second quarter from 4.6 percent in last month's report. **********Today's report also included the Government's first calculation of corporate profits for the spring quarter. **********Profits from current production -- before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments -- rose $1.7 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to $287.9 billion at an annual rate. This compared with a decline of $2.7 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the first quarter. **********Increases were posted in manufacturing, trade and the transportation and public utilities group, while profits fell in other nonmanufacturing industries, the department stated. **********Profits before taxes, but without adjustments, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after falling 7.4 percent in the first quarter, and profits after taxes fell 1.6 percent, compared with a 6.3 percent drop during the winter. But current-production cash flow, a measure of a company's ability to finance projects internally, edged up only a tenth of 1 percent after rising 3.5 percent in the first quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/10/business/business-diary-november-3-8.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1991-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1597, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Diary/November 3-8", "print_headline": "Business Diary/November 3-8", "body_text": " **********COMPANIES The Market Get Jittery Over Maxwell's U.S. Holdings **********Though Robert Maxwell spent his career building a business that spans the globe, 90 percent of the profits of the Maxwell Communication Corporation -- about $352 million -- come from the United States. \"The businesses have performed more strongly than Maxwell really had any right to expect,\" said William Reilly, former president of Maxwell Communication. Still, there is nervousness among investors that Mr. Maxwell paid too much for his American holdings and that his heirs would be forced to sell assets. Interest payments last year were $344.96 million, almost entirely offsetting profits. Last week, David Shaffer was named Maxwell chief executive. Though he has experience in American business, as head of Macmillan since 1990, his appointment did not qualm market jitters over Mr. Maxwell's death. Maxwell share prices fell in London to about $1.20, down almost 50 percent for the week. Compaq's New Chief Moves In  Eckhard Pfeiffer is moving swiftly to rewire the ailing Compaq Computer Corporation. After just two weeks on the job as Compaq's chief executive, Mr. Mr. Pfeiffer outlined a new business strategy. Costs will be cut and the company will bring out a new line of cheaper PC's. It will also drop the price on some of its notebook computers by 25 percent and set up a new distribution system. Mr. Pfeiffer said he was also putting a new top-management team in place. Wall Street was pleased with Mr. Pfeiffer's remarks. The company's stock (it was in the $50 range in May) gained a little ground. Its shares rose $1.25, to $27.875, on the announcements and closed the week at $26.50. Another Alliance for I.B.M.  Big Blue was once considered aloof. No more. Last summer, the International Business Machines Corporation announced plans to join forces with Apple Computer Company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Germany's Siemens and Japan's NEC. Last week, I.B.M. announced one more. It formed a 10-year pact to jointly design computer chips for PC's with the Intel Corporation. Intel makes the chips that are at the heart of most PC's. The new pact gives I.B.M. the right to buy Intel's chips first. It also allows I.B.M. to modify them. It gives \"I.B.M. the flexibility to build things the other guys don't have,\" said Michael Slater, the publisher of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.  An Industry Running on Fumes  The automobile industry's octane rating could use a little boost right now. Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America for October were down 8 percent at the end of October. Business has been so bad that Standard & Poor's issued a credit watch \"with negative implications\" to creditors of the General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company.  Can Pepsi Catch Up? When it comes to globalization, no company knows more than the Coca-Cola Company, which gets 80 percent of its profits from abroad. Those profits have been the been the fizz behind Coke's 20 percent annual growth rate over the last five years. For arch-rival Pepsico Inc. -- which outsells Coke in the United States but not elsewhere -- that smarts. So last week Pepsi said it will invest $1 billion in Spain over five years to build plants, fast-food restaurants and distribution system. Is Pepsi trying to be more like Coke? \"All companies in the United States are trying to become more like Coke,\" said David A. Goldman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. Lockheed's Stock Ploy  The Lockheed Corporation said last week it would purchase 6.3 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock. At current prices, that will cost the company $180 million. The announcement came after the company had pared down its debt and won a number of large Pentagon contracts, including one to build the Air Force's next-generation fighter plane. After a tough proxy battle last year with Harold C. Simmons, the Dallas investor, Lockheed's management said it would do more for investors. Last week, it revealed what it would do: Buy them out.  Rating Off at American Express  A stellar credit rating is something the American Express Company has rarely been without. But last week, Moody's downgraded about $7 billion of Amex's long-term debt. That was a first. The turmoil at its Shearson Lehman Brothers subsidiary did not help the company. Nor did defaults from its Optima credit card holders. While still investment grade, Amex's borrowing costs are expected to rise slightly from the ratings change. Last week, American Express dropped Ogilvy & Mather, its green-card account ad agency, for Chiat/Day/Mojo in New York.  Mr. Olasky's Charity Litmus Test  Each year, Marvin Olasky, a journalism professor at the University of Texas at Austin, grades corporations on their philanthropy. The worst? Dayton Hudson, one of the most generous corporate contributors in America, got an \"F\" last week. Dayton Hudson gave money to \"groups that lobby for increased government welfare, which increases dependency,\" he said. Which groups are those? The Children's Defense Fund and the Center for Community Change. Top marks -- a \"B plus\" -- went to the FMC Corporation. It gave money to the conservative Heritage Foundation, where Mr. Olasky was a resident scholar. ECONOMY **********The Fed Gives It a Try  To control the economy, the Fed has two buttons it can push. Last week it pressed them both. First, it lowered the discount rate, the rate it charges member banks to borrow money, to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent. Then it pulled down the Fed funds rate on overnight loans to 4 3/4 percent from 5 percent. Together, the cuts are designed to add a little pep to the economy. Banks lowered their prime rates to 7 1/2 percent from 8 percent in the aftermath. But some observers remain dubious. \"People do not go out and buy a car just because rates are down half a point,\" said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, of Meridian Bank in Reading, Pa. Hope of a Tax Cut?  To give the lethargic economy a jolt, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, introduced a bill to cut taxes.  The Meaning of Productivity  One side of the argument goes like this: Productivity improvement means workers are adding more value to the nation's economy; wages and living standards increase. But the other side says productivity increases when companies shed workers but still sell as many goods; life becomes harsher. So when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that productivity grew 2.4 percent in the third quarter which side of the argument was supported? \"I'm going out on a limb,\" said Allen Sinai, of the Boston Company. \"This could be the beginning of the process of an increase in the standard of living.\"  More Gloom for Workers  With the economy's engine ignited, but so far failing to lift off, forecasters are skittish. Once they ignored weekly unemployment statistics. Now they ponder them. When the Labor Department said 14,000 people were added to the jobless lists in late October what did it mean? \"We're stagnating.\" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities. INTERNATIONAL **********A Real Soviet Bang for the Buck  With the remnants of the Soviet economy spinning closer to the 'abyss' -- a word used by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week -- everything is for sale. Desperate for hard currency, the Soviets are willing to sell once-secret Mig jets, miniature nuclear reactors and possibly the Mir space station (it's still in orbit). They are also offering services involving underground nuclear explosions. For between $300 to $1,200 a kilogram, the International Chetco Corporation in Moscow is prepared to vaporize toxic waste in an underground explosion. Scientists, environmentalists and weapons-control experts around the world have lodged loud complaints. But so far the Soviet Union is undeterred. According to Vladimir B. Dmitriev, Chetco's president, \"it will be possible to export services.\"  After hesitating for two weeks, the Ukrainian Parliament voted last week to join with Moscow in a new, looser economic union.  Opening More Lines to Europe  Right now, 57,750 conversations can be carried on simultaneously between the United States and Europe, not enough capacity to avoid delays. Next February, capacity will jump to about 150,000 simultaneous calls, still too little capacity for this burgeoning market. So last week, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced it would lay two new fiber-optic cables between the United States and Europe. That would add enough capacity to handle 300,000 simultaneous conversations and data transfers. The project, which will cost about $580 million and take a year to complete, still must be cleared by the Federal Communications Commission. Slow Growth in the Philippines  This has not been a good year for the Philippines. First Mount Pinatubo erupted, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. Then tropical storm Thelma ravaged the islands that make up the country, killing as many as 5,000 people. Nevertheless, growth is still expected to be positive. Last week, President Corazon Aquino said the official estimate is that the Philippines would grow by just less than 1 percent, compared with 3.6 percent last year. One of the reasons for the slowdown is that thousands of Filipino guest workers living abroad who send their salaries home have traveled back to the Philippines to repair their damaged villages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/world/women-among-war-dead.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Women Among War Dead", "print_headline": "Women Among War Dead", "body_text": " **********At least three women were reported to be among the 28 American soldiers who were killed in an Iraqi missile attack on Tuesday.

Then bright colors begin to appear, and what seemed like rocks begin to move. Then there is a person. Then two. And then 100, and then a thousand, and suddenly 50,000 people are carpeting the mountainsides like wildflowers almost as far as the eye can see. **********This was the scene today on the border between Iraq and Turkey, just south of the Turkish mountain village of Cukurca. There in the middle of nowhere Kurdish men, women and children are gathering in a throng on the mountainsides as they flee from the army of President Saddam Hussein. **********Of many memorable aspects of this scene, two stand out: The beehive-like hum of 50,000 Kurds all talking at once that suddenly hits the visitor when he rounds the last bend and the scene unfolds in the valley below, and the dazed, deer-caught-in-the-headlights look that seems locked in the eyes of every Kurd there, particularly the barefoot children too gun-shy to even reach for a free stick of chewing gum. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d flew all the way from Washington to assess this scene on orders from President Bush. He spent only seven minutes in the camp, though, because, his aides said, Turkish Army officers suggested that he leave out of fear that if the crowd got surly they would never be able to control it.  Laundry in a Muddy Stream **********Few of the Kurds had any idea that the American Secretary of State was present or cared that he had actually walked across the Turkish border a few yards into Iraq, where most of the refugees were backed up. The women went about their business of washing clothes in a muddy mountain stream while their menfolk gathered twigs from the hardscrabble mountainsides to make fires that would warm them at night when the temperature dips into the 30's. **********There appeared to be only a dozen tents for 50,000 people, but already the territorial instinct was taking hold. Many families had placed a circle of stones around the plot where they were squatting, apparently assuming that they were going to be there for a while. **********\"Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!\" shouted a Kurdish man as he tried to break through the ring of rifle-toting Turkish soldiers surrounding the Secretary, who was wearing his cowboy boots. \"Can I talk to you please? Please Mr. Baker. I need to talk to you.\" **********The Secretary, slightly taken aback, ordered that the man be let through. \"We are suffering,\" the man said in English. \"Our children are suffering from starvation. We need doctors, we need medicine, we need water. There was heavy bombing on our heads.\" **********Mr. Baker nodded, taking it all in. When the man, who said later that he had walked six days from his Kurdish village to this spot, finished his appeal, the Secretary told him, \"As you may or may not know, President Bush has ordered a major airlift, which is going on right now.\" **********But he quickly added, \"It is up to the international community as a whole to do something about this tragic crime.\" U.S. Analysis Is Rejected **********That was the message that Mr. Baker came to deliver, and he did so to the Turkish officials in Ankara and to the Kurdish refugees. The Kurdish problem is a humanitarian issue and requires a humanitarian response by the international community as a whole, Mr. Baker said. The Bush Administration is not going to become embroiled in the civil war in Iraq to resolve the Kurds' political fate. **********Many Turkish officials and commentators, not to mention the Kurdish refugees, rejected this analysis. They said that they expected the number of Kurds fleeing Iraq to swell to one million in the coming weeks and that those are numbers that are simply beyond the scope of any sustained international relief effort, particularly when the refugees are living hundreds of miles from a major city or real hospital. Thirty thousand refugees is a humanitarian problem, but one million, they argued, is a political problem. **********The only solution, said the Kurds and Turkish officials, is a political one that will enable these Kurds to go back to their homes. But they say they will not do that as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power. They say they will never trust his promises of safe passage home in light of his poison gas attack on Kurds in 1988 and of the fact that his army used tanks, helicopters and planes to fire everything from bullets to napalm on refugees fleeing this week. **********Mr. Baker's visit, hastily arranged last week, is part of the Bush Administration's effort to blunt criticism of its failure to help the Kurds militarily by focusing attention on American aid. **********But the visit has inadvertently underscored that the Kurdish problem, because of its scope, is a political issue that cannot be solved with tents and relief supplies alone. It has also raised anew the question of whether the United States should have ended the war with Mr. Hussein still in power. A Refugee's Question **********A 21-year-old Kurdish refugee in Cukurca remarked after Mr. Baker walked by: \"Why Bush no help Kurdish people destroy Saddam? Schwarzkopf, he want to destroy Saddam, but Bush no?\" **********At a news conference today after his hasty border visit, Mr. Baker declared: \"Today we have witnessed the suffering and despair of the Iraqi people. We have seen examples of cruelty and human anguish that really do defy description. Our relief efforts, including airdrops of supplies, have begun, but they alone are not going to be enough.\" **********\"So,\" Mr. Baker continued, \"the international community has to respond quickly and effectively.\" **********But when Mr. Baker was asked who would protect the Kurds from President Hussein if they did return home, he answered, \"You will now have a major humanitarian relief effort undertaken by the international community, and it is hoped that the presence of humanitarian relief workers will act as a deterrent to future harassment and persecution of these people.\" **********Neither the Turks nor the Kurds seemed to believe that President Hussein would be intimidated by relief workers. The Turks have told the Americans that the Kurdish problem is now a national security question for them. As they see it, President Hussein, by driving the Kurds across the border, is simultaneously solving his Kurdish problem once and for all and obtaining revenge on Turkey for its support for the anti-Iraq coalition. **********As one American diplomat remarked, \"It is as though all of northern Iraq has gotten up and walked.\" Pressure on Turks Seen **********The Turks fear that the addition of the Iraqi Kurds to their own Kurdish population of 20 million will create tremendous political pressure for Turkey, and not Iraq, to cede part of its territory for a Kurdish state. Altogether, there are two million Iraqi Kurds. **********Mr. Baker began his day by flying from Ankara, where he had held talks with Turkey's President, Turgut Ozal, to Diyarbakir, the only city in southeastern Turkey with a runway that could handle his Air Force Boeing 707. From there he and his staff boarded helicopters for a 90-minute flight into the mountains of Kurdistan. **********Before taking off, Mr. Baker inspected an American C-130 loaded with Army rations of chicken a la king and spaghetti with meatballs that were to be parachuted to Kurdish refugees inside Iraq today in hopes of feeding them and thereby keeping them there. **********Mr. Baker's helicopter landed at a small Turkish military base in Cukurca on a plateau guarded by a wall of mountains. Gen. Kamil Basar, the commander at the base, briefed the Secretary on the refugee problem. **********He told him that there were about 280,000 Kurdish refugees in several makeshift camps along the Turkish-Iraqi border and that judging from the numbers that the Turks know are heading in their direction, they expect the figure to reach between 500,000 and 600,000 within a week. **********After the briefing, Mr. Baker met privately with a selected group of Kurdish refugee leaders, including Noori Bireskani, who asked reporters traveling with the Secretary: \"Why did they stop the war? If they would have continued only two more days, they would have finished it.\" **********Then, referring to President Hussein, he said: \"We thought they were going to throw him out for everyone's sake. We are all disappointed.\"                    --------------------       Iran Reopens Border **********NICOSIA, Cyprus, April 8 (Reuters) -- One day after closing its border to Iraqi refugees, Iran reopened it today, but Teheran said it was in urgent need of international help to save the refugees from certain death. **********Interior Ministry officials said 771,850 refugees had arrived by this afternoon. \"The figure is expected to rise to one million by the end of the week and to 1.5 million soon,\" Vahid Dastjeridi, the head of the Red Crescent Society, told the Teheran radio."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/09/world/barring-of-press-from-military-base-upheld.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barring of Press From Military Base Upheld", "print_headline": "Barring of Press From Military Base Upheld", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge today upheld military restrictions against news coverage of the return of bodies of American troops killed in the Persian Gulf war. **********The Defense Department has barred the press from Dover Air Force Base, Del., when bodies of servicemen and servicewomen have arrived from the gulf region, saying it wanted to protect the privacy of the troops' families. **********A group of photographers, reporters and other groups filed suit, saying the restrictions violated press freedoms.

Now it has become a target of deadly terrorism. **********A Treuhand office in Berlin was firebombed on Friday, and three days later the director, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, was killed by a sniper from the far-left Red Army Faction. The assaults have thrust the Treuhandanstalt, or Public Trustee, to the forefront of political debate. **********The assaults have also added an element of tragedy to the troubled process of German unification, and jolted those who believed unification could be achieved calmly and without conflict. **********In eastern Germany, the name Treuhand is often taken in vain. People there blame the agency for selling and shutting down hundreds of formerly state-owned companies without concern for workers. Unemployment at 9.2% **********As if to underline the deterioration of economic conditions in eastern Germany, officials in Bonn today released figures showing that unemployment there, formerly all but unknown, has reached 9.2 percent. Many analysts believe the true figure is substantially higher, and several political and religious figures have predicted it could reach 50 percent by mid-summer. **********After the killing of Mr. Rohwedder, Government officials have pledged that Treuhand policies will not be altered. **********\"No change in direction is needed,\" Finance Minister Theo Waigel asserted after meeting with Treuhand executives in Berlin on Wednesday. He said terrorism would not force the Government to retreat into \"fear and paralysis.\" **********Nonetheless, the killing threw a pall over the unification process. Financial experts said it might discourage some foreign investors who had been considering buying or establishing companies in eastern Germany. New Director to Be Named **********Mr. Waigel is expected to name a new director for the Treuhand soon. The leading candidate is said to be Birgit Breuel, a Volkswagen board member who has been working for the Treuhand since last year. **********Politicians from eastern Germany joined in condemning Mr. Rohwedder's slaying. But in recent weeks, many had expressed rising frustration with Treuhand policies. **********\"The problem is that the Treuhand is part of the Finance Ministry, and the Finance Ministry's job is to worry only about money,\" Klaus Buttner, the Mayor of Weimar, said in a recent interview. \"Nobody is worrying about the human beings whose lives are being thrown into upheaval.\" **********Treuhand managers are responsible for the liquidation of about 8,000 companies in eastern Germany. They have shut about 300 of the companies and have sold about 1,000 others, many at bargain prices. Treuhand policies emphasize quick action against indigent companies, rather than subsidies to keep them afloat. A Symbol of the Divide **********Before his death, Mr. Rohwedder, who was 58 years old, often acknowledged the anger his policies had provoked in the East. He portrayed himself, however, as a true friend of eastern Germany whose policies would, in the long run, prove to have been economically sound. **********Even in death, Mr. Rohwedder has become a symbol of the cleavage between eastern and western Germany. Officials from the two parts of the country are arguing over how the murder investigation should be conducted. **********The Red Army Faction, which as taken responsibility for the killing, maintained intimate ties to the former East German secret police, the Stasi. Prosecutors want access to Stasi files to search for possible leads. But organizers of the anti-Stasi movement in eastern Germany, suspicious of security agencies after 40 years of police oppression, do not want the files turned over to law enforcement officers. **********In Bonn, Johannes Gerster, a senior member of Parliament from the governing Christian Democratic Union, called for the creation of a special parliamentary commission to investigate ties between the Red Army Faction and the Stasi. **********The police said today that they had no clues to the identity of the sniper who killed Mr. Rohwedder as he sat in his Dusseldorf home shortly before midnight on Monday. They said that the Red Army Faction consisted of about 15 to 20 members, and that many are unknown to the police. **********The rifle used to kill Mr. Rohwedder, the police said, was the same one used to fire shots at the United States Embassy in Bonn in February. That case is still unsolved. So are the three other assaults, two of them fatal, attributed to the Red Army since the Berlin wall fell in 1989."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/21/world/yugoslavia-perplexed-over-status-of-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Chuck Sudetic", "pub_date": "1991-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslavia Perplexed Over Status of Aid", "print_headline": "Yugoslavia Perplexed Over Status of Aid", "body_text": " **********Yugoslavia's Prime Minister said tonight that he had received implied assurances from President Bush that the United States would not cut off economic aid to his country because of human rights violations. **********The Prime Minister, Ante Markovic, said that in a telephone call tonight, Mr. Bush indicated that there had been no fundamental change in U.S. policy toward this Balkan country of six quarrelsome republics. **********\"Mr. Bush underlined support for the unity and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the reform efforts of its Government,\" Mr. Markovic said.

No one is likely to offer this company much mercy.\" Sophisticated Gear **********The Japanese-made equipment included gyroscopes, inertial navigation systems and other sophisticated electronic gear, all made under license from American military contractors. The licenses specify that Japan Aviation is permitted to sell the equipment only to the Japanese military, which requires that most of its components be made in Japan. Slightly more than half of Japan Aviation's stock is owned by one of the world's biggest electronics conglomerates, NEC Corporation. **********So far, no arrests have been made. But the Japanese authorities have raided Japan Aviation's offices in Tokyo, and officials familiar with the investigation say they found evidence of more than a dozen separate transactions in which military electronics was apparently sold to agents of the Miami concern, which they identified as Aero Systems Inc. The equipment was allegedly transferred in hotel rooms in Tokyo and transported, in ordinary luggage, to Hong Kong and Singapore, and ultimately to Iran, investigators say. **********Other officials say they are not aware of evidence that the Japanese Government knew of the transactions in advance, or approved sales under pressure from the United States. **********For Japan the case has disturbing similarities to the 1987 Toshiba scandal, when a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation was discovered to have shipped huge machine tools to the Soviet Union. American officials contend that the tools were used to make special propellers that help Soviet nuclear submarines evade detection. **********In the aftermath of the Toshiba scandal, most of Japan's major companies adapted strict export-control policies, including NEC and Japan Aviation. But the sales to Iran apparently continued until 1989. \"It's a mystery to me,\" said an American executive in Tokyo who had dealings with Japan Aviation. \"They are a very conservative company. The amount of money involved in these deals is relatively small. There is no clear reason why they did it.\"  Police Will Say Little **********So far the police have said little about what Japan Aviation sold to Aero Systems. Most of the equipment seems suited for Sidewinder missiles and American-made fighter. Iran had both, left over from American equipment sold to the Shah of Iran in the 1970's. **********As in the Toshiba case, Japanese investigators apparently knew nothing about the exports until they received queries from American officials. The questions about Japan Aviation apparently arose from a United States Customs Service investigation. Affidavits filed in Miami in December 1989 by Customs officials alleged that Aero Systems circumvented export controls and used a front company in Hong Kong, Hierax Company, to ship aircraft parts to Iran starting in 1981. **********For reasons that are not clear, Aero Systems apparently turned to Japan Aviation to supply equipment that is also made in the United States. Some executives speculate that because export control enforcement has historically been lax in Japan, it is possible that the companies determined that there was little risk of detection. **********Japanese news reports say Japan Aviation sold its goods to Hierax, which in turn sent them to a firm in Singapore. Aero Systems' annual report, filed recently with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, indicates that it sold an unnamed subsidiary in Hong Kong, which it said dealt in \"general consumer products manufactured in the Far East.\" **********Officials of Japan Aviation and Aero Systems have refused to comment. \"We are simply not answering any inquiries about this,\" a woman in the office of Robert G. Holmes Jr., Aero System's president, said by telephone.  Relations With Honeywell **********Almost all of Japan Aviation's gyroscopes and inertial navigation equipment are produced under a license from Honeywell Inc. The relationship between the companies goes back more than a decade, and at one point they considered a venture in Japan. But there is no evidence that Honeywell was aware of the transactions. **********Japan Aviation is the largest maker of aviation electronics here, with sales of nearly half-a-billion dollars annually. More than 40 percent of its equipment is purchased by the Japanese military and the country's civilian space program. The firm's top executives, many of whom are drawn from NEC, are said to have strong links to the Japanese military establishment. **********Military budgets are slowing in Japan, and the company's competitors say it is possible that the concern felt pressure to find customers outside of Japan. That would be permissible under Japanese law, as long as the equipment is destined for civilian uses, like commercial airliners. \"We are guessing that Japan Aviation wanted to expand its market in Southeast Asia through Aero Systems,\" a Japanese official said. \"And then they were seduced to deal with Iran.\" **********In one case -- the shipment of small \"flywheels\" that help stabilize the flight of Sidewinder missiles -- officials say employees of Japan Aviation must have known how the equipment would be used. That shipment, in 1989, may be the only one that goes to court. The statute of limitations may have run out on previous transactions. Until the Toshiba scandal, Japan's statute of limitations on export-control violations was three years; it has since been extended to five."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/01/business/foreign-stocks-gain-but-us-investors-lag.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1991-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 515, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foreign Stocks Gain, But U.S. Investors Lag", "print_headline": "Foreign Stocks Gain, But U.S. Investors Lag", "body_text": " **********It was a good quarter for investors in foreign stock markets.

Gyrations in the Markets **********Some gyrations in the markets were the product of sudden shifts in focus. One day investors would look beyond recessions or economic slowdowns in many countries to recoveries. Then on the next day, a set of disappointing earnings would return them to the bad news of the moment. **********Germany, where the Financial Times index rose 7.7 percent in marks, was the weakest performer of the major stock markets. For Americans, the dollar's rally turned the modest gain into a 5.2 percent loss. While the Frankfurt market rallied on the war victory, thoughts in Germany quickly turned to the growing economic problems in the former East Germany: rising unemployment and political protests.

But to their surprise, they have developed alternatives -- including warm, soapy water -- that in some cases are better and less expensive than CFC's. Some companies have revamped their manufacturing methods to produce circuit boards that need no cleaning at all. **********Environmentalists say the rapid progress demonstrates how unfounded the industry's complaints about the burden of environmental regulations can be. They say the CFC experience shows what can happen when companies stop fighting environmental measures and instead seek to carry them out. **********\"This is just another example of how when push comes to shove, you can get beyond the first line of defense,\" said Ted Smith, the executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a group that monitors pollution by electronics companies here. \"For all the moaning that went on, it really has not been a significant technical problem.\" **********David Doniger, the senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the CFC example had important implications for other concerns, including how much time the industry should have to reduce fossil-fuel use, which contributes to global warming. Environmentalists cite other examples, such as the elimination of CFC from aerosol cans and the formulation of cleaner gasolines. **********Industry executives are divided on whether other environmental goals can be met as readily as the phasing out of CFC's. But some say that with sufficient determination industry can indeed solve other problems. \"If the Federal Government set a goal that there would be no fossil fuels sold by 1994, I bet you we would see electric cars by then,\" said George Allen, the chemist in charge of CFC reduction at Apple Computer Inc. **********The electronics industry's progress is most evident at the International Business Machines Corporation's sprawling disk drive factory here, which in 1987 was the nation's largest source of CFC-113 emissions. The chemical is the main type of chlorofluorocarbon used by the industry. **********I.B.M. said this week that its CFC-113 emissions at the San Jose plant last year were 95 percent below the 1987 level. Officials here also hope they can eliminate the solvent's use by the end of the year, two years ahead of the corporate target date.  High-Tech Car Wash **********I.B.M., which is based in Armonk, N.Y., is replacing chlorofluorocarbons with, of all things, water. In the plant, disk-drive components are dipped in soapy water and are then carried by a moving track through various bays, where they are rinsed and dried with hot air in what resembles a miniature car wash. **********\"Some of the things we thought would be really big problems in 1987 turned out to not be such big problems,\" said June J. Andersen, the plant's manager of environmental programs. \"It's hard to imagine in 1991, but in 1987 this was a hotly debated issue of whether you could water-clean the parts.\" **********Other large companies, including the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Northern Telecom, the Digital Equipment Corporation and Apple, have said they will eliminate CFC's by no later than 1994.  Other Problems Remain **********But some experts say problems remain. Many smaller companies have not yet taken action, for lack of money or interest. Military contractors have not moved as fast as commercial computer and telephone companies, saying that regulations gave them less freedom to alter their production processes. **********\"The speed at which the industry as a whole is converting is not the same as those big-name, high-profile companies,\" said Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He added that the electronics industry was moving faster than expected. **********Chlorofluorocarbons have been linked to the deterioration of the ozone layer, which in turn is expected to lead to a sharp rise in certain types of cancer. In an accord reached in Montreal in 1987 and since amended, many nations agreed to eliminate the use of CFC's by the year 2000.  A Big User of CFC's **********The electronics industry accounts for about 20 percent of the use of CFC's in the United States. The largest use, accounting for about 40 percent of consumption, is in air-conditioners and refrigerators. Another primary use is in making foam for insulation and food packaging. **********The executives say all the industries that use CFC's are reconsidering their statements about how hard it would be to eliminate the chemicals. \"Our views have changed on how quickly it could be done,\" said Kevin Fay, the executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, an ndustry lobbying group. **********He said that makers of refrigerators, air-conditioners and foam insulation were shifting toward alternatives, though in some cases these are other fluorocarbon-based chemicals less harmful to the ozone layer than the ones they replace.  Du Pont's Prediction **********But the electronics industry's progress has been particularly fast -- especially considering that a few years ago, an expert at Du Pont, the leading manufacturer of CFC's, predicted that CFC-113 would be the most difficult type to replace. **********CFC-113 is mainly used to clean printed circuit boards of the residue that remains after chips and other components are soldered on. The residue can cause corrosion, leading to a breakdown of the computer. **********Such cleaning is becoming more important, and more difficult, as the industry develops more complex products. Chlorofluorocarbons not only cleaned all the nooks and crannies well, it was also non-toxic, nonflammable and inexpensive. **********While Du Pont and others have developed some alternatives to CFC-113, many electronics companies have not waited. Some use water to clean components, while others have turned to a solvent made from terpenes, chemicals that are extracted from orange rinds.  Modifying the Process **********And other companies, like Northern Telecom and Apple Computer, are modifying their soldering process so that circuit boards do not have to be cleaned at all. This not only eliminates CFC's but also saves a step in manufacturing, and eliminates the need for water and for waste-water disposal, which are drawbacks of the other approaches. **********\"When you go to an electronics conference today, people complain that there are so many choices, not that they don't know what to do,\" said Stephen Andersen, an official of the Environmental Protection Agency who works with electronics companies. \"That's a real turnaround from when they were saying 'Goodbye computers.' \" **********The industry executives say that cleaning processes must be tailored for each product or assembly line and that no CFC substitutes have been found for some areas. \"There is no one magic drop-in solution,\" said David R. Chittick, A.T.& T.'s vice president for environment and safety. The telephone company is aiming to end its use of CFC's by 1994.  Just as Good, Even Better **********The executives say that in some cases the alternatives clean as well as CFC's or even better. And in some cases, the alternatives are also less expensive, although there can be high initial costs. **********\"We've shortened the process, gotten better-quality boards; it's been more helpful to the environmnet, and we've saved money,\" said Margaret G. Kerr, the vice president of health and safety for Northern Telecom. The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer has pledged to eliminate CFC's by the end of the year, earlier than most companies. **********A I.B.M. spokesman said the company was expected to have spent about $100 million in capital and personnel costs by 1993, its target for eliminating CFC's from its plants worldwide. He said I.B.M. did not expect to save money over all. But at the San Jose plant, Dr. Andersen said she expected savings to pay for the cost of new cleaning equipment in three years.  Reasons for Progress **********There are several reasons for the electronic industry's progress. It is used to rapid change because of technological advances. A Federal tax that has more than doubled the price of CFC's is scheduled to keep rising. And some environmentalists speculate that the industry, which has generally enjoyed a reputation as nonpolluting, was growing uncomfortable being blamed for contributing to ozone destruction. **********But the industry executives say the secret was to consider the goal a challenge, like developing a new product, rather than merely doing the minimum to comply with guidelines. **********\"I've never seen a project with this level of grass-roots motivation by the engineering team,\" said Dr. Andersen of I.B.M. \"They got convinced that this was the right thing to do.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/05/business/patents-circuit-could-help-computers-mimic-brain.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1991-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Circuit Could Help Computers Mimic Brain", "print_headline": "Patents; Circuit Could Help Computers Mimic Brain", "body_text": " **********In pursuit of a \"neural network\" computing system that mimics the human brain, researchers at a California company have patented a new circuit that could serve as an important building block for computers that teach themselves to recognize patterns and images. **********To recognize an image, a computer must make sense of millions of bits of data that stream through a vast number of tiny receptors. Conventional computers try to match patterns of incoming signals with patterns stored in their memories. **********Neural network systems, however, respond to particular patterns in particular ways. The processors send electrical signals, and the computer \"rewards\" processors that contribute to \"correct\" responses by increasing the strength of their signals and decreasing the strength of signals from processors that contribute to \"incorrect\" responses. **********Toward this goal, researchers at Synaptics Inc. of San Jose, Calif., have patented a refinement on what is known as a \"winner take all\" circuit. First developed by John Lazzaro, a scientist at the University of Colorado, the winner-take-all circuit is something of a gatekeeper that instantly selects the strongest signal from the array of different processors, or neurons, relying on basic principles of physics. **********\"It's an amazingly clever circuit,\" said Timothy P.

Some, like Richard O. Rieger of Ladenburg, Thalmann, dismiss most of the distributors as \"uninteresting\" companies in an extremely competitive business. \"These guys are making less money on much larger revenues than in the early 1980's,\" Mr. Rieger said. **********True, say others, but the industry has gone through plenty of consolidation since earnings and share prices crashed in the mid-1980's. Some 25 companies have left the business. Most recently, Arrow acquired the North American and European operations of Lex Services P.L.C., a British company that had often been an instigator of costly price wars. \"I think we are close to equilibrium again,\" said Mark Hassenberg, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"If you get some increase in sales volume,\" he said of the distributor sector, \"you will get strong earnings growth.\" **********Arrow has been the sector's star, with its shares rising on the Big Boad from $3.625 last January to $16 earlier this month. It closed yesterday at $14. The company, based in Melville, L.I., is heavily indebted, having relied on junk bonds to finance its expansion during the 1980's. But Wall Street was impressed with its smooth absorption of its rival Kierulff, acquired four years ago. The betting is that Arrow can do the same with Lex. **********The biggest unknowns are how quickly Arrow can eliminate overlap between its operations and Lex's and how much business the combined company can retain. Some customers who bought from both companies are likely to shift part of their purchasing elsewhere to make sure they have multiple sources of supplies. And some major chip makers may also look for a second distributor. **********Mr. Hassenberg estimates that Arrow will achieve nearly $1.36 billion in revenues in 1992, assuming $130 million less in sales than if Arrow and Lex hold on to all their business. He says the company, with Lex, has overtaken Avnet in total electronic component sales, and is still undervalued. He predicts that the stock will move into the high teens, at which point Arrow will issue new stock to pay down its high-cost debts. And he says the stock could top $30 within 18 months if the economy begins to recover. **********But others say the combined company could lose several hundred million dollars of its current business. And Clarke Walser, who follows the industry for Hamilton Investments in Chicago, said that the Lex's value to Arrow was harder to assess than the Kierulff acquisition because Lex involved overseas operations and more customer overlap. \"There's not much margin for error in the current price,\" Mr. Walser said. **********Analysts say that Avnet's strongest selling points are a healthy balance sheet and the investment it has made in modernizing its distribution system. But the Great Neck, L.I., based company needs more sales volume for those investments to pay off. Most rate the company a hold at $24.875, its close yesterday on the Big Board. In early February it was over $29. **********Perhaps the most admired company in the group at the moment is Anthem Electronics Inc., a specialty distributor that concentrates on higher-priced components. Anthem, based in San Jose, Calif., is also cited as an example of the trend among distributors to raise earnings with value-added services like assembling components or programming memory circuits before delivery. **********Even Mr. Rieger has a buy recommendation on the company. Anthem's shares jumped from $15.75, in early January to $35 over the next three months, then bounced down as far as $27.625 by Oct. 7 and subsequently rallied. It closed yesterday at $33.375 a share on the Big Board. **********Marshall Industries, the one major distributor handling Japanese semiconductors, has had a bumpier ride but closed yesterday at $24.50, up more than 20 percent from its January levels. Two smaller distributors also listed on the Big Board, Wyle Laboratories and Bell Industries, have been less successful. Wyle, based in El Segundo, Calif., rose sharply last winter to a peak of $17 in April but finished trading yesterday at $11, down slightly from its price at the beginning of the year. Los Angeles-based Bell is down from $13.625 at the beginning of the year to $9.75 in yesterday's trading, but Leonard Goldberg, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, says its prospects are looking up as it expands to the East Coast from its Southern California base. **********Mr. Goldberg sees the whole group as \"a less painful way to play the semiconductor cycle\" than the semiconductor companies themselves. The stocks have relatively few shares outstanding, he said, but they typically move less dramatically than those of the chip makers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/01/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-no-madge-manicures-palmolive-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Madge or Manicures In Palmolive Campaign", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; No Madge or Manicures In Palmolive Campaign", "body_text": " **********Madge the manicurist, the advertising character who has touted Palmolive dishwashing liquid for more than two decades, may no longer be surprising customers with her trademark line, \"You're soaking in it.\" **********For the first time since the character appeared, the Colgate-Palmolive Company and its agency, FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, is introducing a significant campaign without her.

But it also raised some fares in an attempt to compensate for revenue lost through the many reductions. **********American introduced a number of short-term promotions like a $318 round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles or San Francisco, and the other four biggest airlines -- United, Delta, Northwest and Continental -- said they would match most of them. **********But American went beyond these special offers, altering its pricing structure and hoping the industry will follow. The airline, which along with its competitors had spent two years trying to simplify the fare structure and eliminate many discount rates, is now seeking to reverse that trend. It has brought back the 30-day advanced-purchase fare, which until it was phased out two years ago had been the lowest fare available to travelers. It also added new discount fares aimed at the business traveler. And it is substantially cutting the price of some international tickets.  14-Day Fares to Rise **********But while American revived the 30-day discount fare, it will significantly raise its 14-day advance purchase fares, which have been particularly popular with leisure travelers. The carrier also announced that more of its lowest discount fares will now require travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday, the days when the most seats are available industrywide. The goal is to try to prevent discount passengers from taking away too many seats from higher-fare passengers. American also said it would limit the number of lowest-fare seats that it makes available. **********To these changes, the other major carriers reacted cautiously, saying they needed to study them. **********American will revive the 30-day advance-purchase fare on April 9, after its short-term promotions end. The 30-day fares will for the most part be somewhat lower than the best fares now available except for the short-term offers. For example, a round trip between New York and Los Angeles on weekdays will cost $468 if bought 30 days in advance and on weekends, $518. **********The current 14-day rate on weekdays is $504 and on weekends, $554. But the 14-day fare between these cities will rise to $558 on weekdays, and to $608 on weekends. **********Michael W. Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at American, said the 30-day advance-purchase fare would be the lowest discount fare in the market -- about 8 to 10 percent below the current 14-day fares and from $60 to $90 a round trip below the new, lower 14-day fares. Low Prices Until April 8 **********The savings on the short-term offer are more substantial. For example, the round-trip fare from New York to San Francisco, which was $504 on weekdays on a ticket bought at least 14 days before traveling, will fall to $318 for travel during the spring and to $398 for travel during the summer, as long as the ticket is bought by April 8. The new fare must be purchased seven days in advance, is not refundable and requires a Saturday-night stay. **********American is also trying to respond to the growing resistance of business travelers to pay full coach fares, which have risen substantially in recent years. **********For the short term, it matched Delta's offer of 20 percent off regular coach fare if the trip is booked three days in advance. **********For tickets bought after April 9. American has proposed a seven-day advance purchase fare aimed at business travelers that would have a 25 percent cancellation penalty.  Discounts to Europe **********American is also offering lower fares to Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Travel from New York to various European destinations, for example, would be $598 round trip during the peak travel period after June 1, which is 29 to 32 percent lower than the current Eurosaver fare, the main discount fare in the market. **********Some analysts would not characterize American's moves as the beginning of a fare war, because they were not aimed at gaining share in a particular market or against another carrier. Instead, they said, the strategy was broadly aimed at stimulating weak traffic. **********Mr. Gunn said the fare restructuring was intended to encourage people to make their summer reservations early.  Profits Are Expected **********Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the fares would not cut too deeply into the industry's revenues because fares have been driven upward by about 15 percent by a series of fuel surchages since last August. He added that there had also been significant fare increases before then. **********Mr. Murphy said that because of the increases the industry had room to cut and still keep fares high enough to make a profit. **********The industry has been helped recently by a drop in fuel prices to about 70 cents a gallon, from well over $1 last fall. Traffic has also showed signs of recovering now that the Persian Gulf crisis has been resolved although it is still far below normal. **********On the other hand, the carriers have been taking delivery of a large number of new planes and need to bring in more passengers to fill up the new capacity. **********American is preparing to take over the London routes of Trans World Airlines, pending approval from government agencies, and is trying to restore the confidence of travelers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/business/seeking-to-stay-out-of-proxy-battles.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1991-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seeking to Stay Out of Proxy Battles", "print_headline": "Seeking to Stay Out of Proxy Battles", "body_text": " **********Dozens of companies that want to avoid messy proxy battles are quietly accepting the demands of pension funds to lower their takeover defenses and broaden the rights of shareholders. **********The K Mart Corporation has agreed to seek shareholder approval next month to phase out its \"poison pill\" takeover defenses within four years. **********Avon Products Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company have agreed to meet regularly with a shareholder advisory group. The Boise Cascade Corporation revised its rules to give dissident shareholder proposals a better chance of passing. **********Other companies have instituted confidential shareholder voting and eliminated \"golden parachutes\" that benefit executives in the event of a takeover. **********Many companies are now giving in to stave off shareholder votes that threaten less favorable results, and to develop loyal shareholder followings that can help fend off takeovers. **********The growing sophistication of institutional investors, whose holdings have increased to more than half the stock in American corporations, has also recently made companies more responsive. Public employee pension funds, once passive, have learned how to rally other shareholders. **********\"It makes absolutely no sense for a corporation to act in a hostile manner against its shareholders,\" said Owen F. Knauer, head of investor relations at K Mart. \"I don't think large corporations have had much experience with this type of relationship. But our view was: 'Why go through a hassle with a major shareholder? Why not talk things out.' \" **********At K Mart, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board submitted a 1990 proxy proposal asking that important takeover defenses require approval by shareholders, not just the board. The measure failed, getting a majority of shares voted but not the required majority of all shares. Subsequent talks yielded the plan that K Mart will present to shareholders next month. **********The Wisconsin fund, with $20 billion, and the California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, with $61 billion, are the most prominent among those putting pressure on executives and boards to heed shareholder views. **********The United Shareholders Association, a group founded by T. Boone Pickens, the corporate raider, to represent smaller investors, has successfully pursued the same sorts of issues as the pension funds. **********Many companies are now making concessions on issues that public employee funds have pursued for years. Cheaper to Talk **********\"We are seeing the early stages of what will be very, very healthy dialogues,\" said Howard Sherman, a vice president at Institutional Shareholders Services Inc., a Washington proxy advisory firm. \"The two sides are looking to find some common ground and a partnership.\" **********The funds often take aim at poorly performing corporations on the notion that as corporate governance improves, so will performance. Corporations facing a hostile attack are often the most willing to talk. **********Companies find it a lot cheaper to keep big shareholders happy than to protect themselves by finding new, friendly investors. **********\"If you take this to the logical conclusion, a corporation can create a class of patient investors through dialogue and not have to resort to the exorbitant prices of private placements and white squires,\" said Mr. Sherman of Institutional Shareholders Services. \"This, in turn, can lower a company's cost of capital and increase profitability.\" **********Richard Koppes, general counsel for the California employees fund, said the decline in hostile takeovers has actually enhanced the pension funds' influence at many companies. \"Things are just snowballing,\" he said. \" The raiders are gone because the money is not there and the power is now in the votes.\" **********Not all companies, however, are eager to cooperate. \"There are still some hard-core boards and C.E.O.'s who have that old Victorian feeling that shareholders should be seen and not heard,\" said John C. Wilcox, managing director at Georgeson & Company, a New York proxy solicitation firm. \"There are still many directors that grew up when shareholders were passive and trusting, and that's no longer the case.\" **********The Wisconsin Investment Board has filed proxy proposals after failing to convince Pfizer Inc., the United Technologies Corporation and United Telecommunications Inc. to alter their poison pill provisions. The California fund has failed to reach agreements with Hercules Inc., the Northrop Corporation, the Scott Paper Company and the Whirlpool Corporation on a number of issues. **********But the successes are signficant. At Avon, which was recently under attack by a major shareholder, Chartwell Associates, that wanted greater board representation, James E. Preston, Avon's chairman, conferred closely with executives of the California fund. The fund had failed last year to win approval for a proxy proposal seeking a shareholder advisory committee. This year, as the fund prepared to offer the proposal again, Avon agreed to a less formal arrangement, holding semi-annual meetings with several public and corporate pension funds. **********\"Boards are now more willing to engage in constructive dialogue with these groups,\" said W. Thomas Knight, an Avon senior vice president. \"We've been through this slavish process of cleaning up our balance sheet and restoring our core business to health and we want to reach out to our owners.\" Meeting With Shareholders **********At Sears, Edward A. Brennan, the chief executive, pledged to meet with managers of the California fund twice a year after the fund agreed to drop a proxy proposal calling for a nine-member committee to advise the corporate board. \"We're always willing to meet with individual large shareholders,\" said David Shute, Sears's general counsel. **********Boise Cascade accepted a proposal from the California fund that failed in a proxy vote last year. The fund wanted shares not voting to be eliminated from any proxy tallies; the board had counted them as \"no\" votes. When Boise's chief executive, John B. Fery went to meet with the fund's managers in California after the measure's consideration last year, he \"told us it made a lot of sense to him,\" said Mr. Koppes, the fund's lawyer. **********Vincent Hannity, the Boise director of investor relations, said the company wanted to avoid another battle over the proposal this year. \"If there is any way to resolve proxy issues without submitting them to shareholders, we'd prefer to do it that way,\" he said. \"Whenever you take a formal public position, you will have people taking the opposite position and then you have a fight on your hands.\" **********Shareholder groups besides the pension funds are also exerting pressure. United Shareholders has gained agreements from Baxter International Inc., Consolidated Freightways Inc., the General Signal Corporation, the Unisys Corporation and the Weyerhaeuser Company for confidential voting and the elimination of golden parachutes. Some companies make changes to remove themselves from United Shareholders' Target 50 list of companies said to have poor records on shareholders rights. **********\"Five years ago, we couldn't get a phone call returned,\" said Ralph V. Whitworth, president of United Shareholders, based in Washington . \"Now a lot of companies don't want to take proxies to a vote because it could cast a disparaging light on management.

Spector, a nonproliferation analyst and author at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. **********The letter, delivered to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday, also shows that at least some of Iraq's critical stockpile of potentially weapon grade fuel had been moved from the country's main nuclear installation at Tuwaitha near Baghdad to an undisclosed site for reasons of safety. **********Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, American commander of the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf war, said in late January that warplanes \"have neutralized their manufacturing capabilities, their nuclear manufacturing capability.\" Officials Pleased With Response **********The Iraqi letter said that nuclear material was shifted during the war from locations known to the International Atomic Energy Agency to \"nearby locations, thus avoiding the possibility of a nuclear accident and any risks including radiation contamination.\" **********Bush Administration and agency officials said they were pleased with the Iraqi response, which followed an earlier letter that was considered insufficient. On April 18, when the Iraqis sent an inventory of all of its weapons of mass destruction to the United Nations as required by the Security Council cease-fire resolution, they denied having nuclear arms or nuclear weapons-grade material. **********Most Western analysts said before the war that Iraq still faced technical problems in developing nuclear weapons and that even with sufficient enriched uranium, it would take Baghdad 5 to 10 years to build and deploy nuclear warheads. **********The latest Iraqi letter informed the United Nations agency based in Vienna that some of the nuclear material that was not hidden away was buried under the rubble of the bombed reactors but the Iraqis asserted that there is no evidence of damage to any of the fuel. **********\"This is a total capitulation,\" said one Administration official who is familiar with Iraq's nuclear programs. \"The first letter the Iraqis wrote was completly unforthcoming and revealed nothing. The Iraqis have come back with an extraordinarily detailed account of the status, location and amount of all of the enriched material.\" **********Administration and I.A.E.A. officials also said they were surprised by the number of Iraq's nuclear research installations. \"There was building after building that we didn't really know about,\" said one senior Administration official. \"There were a lot of sites that we suspected were engaged in nuclear activity, but just weren't sure.\" **********According to the document, most of the 24 installations listed, which include a number of research, production and design laboratories, were completely destroyed. **********Under the terms of the cease-fire resolution, all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are to be destroyed or removed.  Uranium in Various Forms **********The inventory submitted by Iraq reveals that it received tons of uranium in various forms from previously undisclosed sources. The imports include six tons of depleted uranium from sources, which remain undisclosed and 1.8 tons of lightly enriched uranium, which Adminsitration officials said was sent from Italy more than a decade ago and which was subject to agency safeguards. The lightly enriched uranium could significantly increase the output of weapons-grade uranium from future Iraqi centrifuges. **********The inventory also shows that Iraq possesses more than the 48 pounds of highly enriched uranium obtained from France and the Soviet Union that nonproliferation experts believed to be under I.A.E.A. inspection. **********The inventory confirms the existence of a site at Al Qaim in northwestern Iraq near the Syrian border that produced yellowcake, uranium concentrate that centrifuges can convert to weapons-grade nuclear fuel. Iraq maintained the installation was completely destroyed. **********But there are significant omissions, Administration officials and nuclear nonproliferation experts said. The inventory fails to list nuclear-weapons development laboratories, like Al Qaqaa, which the officials and experts said may have been conducting high explosives research and assembly before the war. It also does not list the Osirak research reactor near Baghdad bombed by Israel in 1981.  Centrifuges Not Mentioned **********Neither does the letter mention any of Iraq's equipment for producing and testing high-speed centrifuges. Centrifuges, machines that extract the uranium isotope usable in nuclear weapons by rapidly spinning uranium gas, are widely regarded as the key to Iraq's future nuclear potential. **********Despite Iraq's attempt to be more forthcoming on identifying weapons of mass destruction, the United States and Britain have taken the lead in the Security Council in opposing the lifting of sanctions against Iraq, and have resisted Iraqi appeals to sell oil on the world market or to be given access to assets frozen in foreign banks. **********In Washington, the White House said today that it would oppose allowing Iraq to sell its oil or gain access to its frozen assets unless Washington were convinced that the Iraqis would use the money for humanitarian purposes. **********\"We don't have a lot of confidence in Saddam Hussein,\" said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, referring to the Iraqi President.

The reason is that more of those legs are attached to people who are old enough to drive and vote. **********As more grown-ups take part in a holiday once the exclusive province of children, advertisers, always eager to cash in on a consumer trend, are directing more Halloween-themed advertisements at adults. Research by Hallmark Cards Inc. indicates that one adult in three now takes part in Halloween activities. **********A print ad for Hallmark, created by Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, typifies the trend. Amid photographs of a cryptful of holiday merchandise for adults, from T-shirts to earrings to lapel pins, the headline reads, \"This Halloween, why should the little monsters have all the fun?\" **********Behind the adult focus to Halloween, said Dan Fox, the executive vice president of Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago, is that \"the baby boomers are taking the things of their childhood into adulthood, and they're unwilling to let go.\" **********The actress Elvira, who has gained popularity for her campy shtick as the \"Mistress of the Dark,\" is featured in a campaign that Foote, Cone has created for Coors Light beer. In a television commercial, after Elvira crowns Coors Light with a made-up designation as \"the official beer of Halloween,\" she changes the word \"right\" in the brand's slogan, making it \"It's the fright beer now.\" **********Another explanation as to why adults are adopting Halloween as a holiday comes from Sherry S. Timbrook, a spokeswoman for Hallmark, from the company's offices in Kansas City, Mo. \"As we become more hectic and more busy,\" she said, \"Halloween is a day when we can escape and be whoever we want to be.\" **********\"No one laughs at you for being silly, or acting out a fantasy,\" she added. **********Also influencing the trend is the idea that for decades, Halloween has been for an occasion for adults in the gay community to throw parties and stage parades. Like other trends that begin among homosexuals and enter the mainstream, so, too, have adult-oriented Halloween happenings. **********Among other advertisers seeking to appeal to adults at Halloween are the Pillsbury Company, which in magazine ads urges bakers to \"Make them a cake so scary, it's scary!\"; Anheuser-Busch Inc., which in television spots has a woman dressed as a vampire telling the celebrants at a Halloween party, \"I want to drink your Bud\"; the First Brands Corporation, which is introducing King Pumpkin and the Pumpkinettes, decorative orange lawn bags with drawn-on pumpkin faces, and the Kellogg Company, which is advertising its Mrs. Smith's pies in newspapers with the slogan \"Mom knows witch's best.\" **********Some Halloween campaigns are meant to appeal to adults and youngsters alike. One television spot, touting Sega of America's new Joe Montana Football sports video game, shows the San Francisco 49ers quarterback in the clutches of a mad scientist. **********\"We're primarily selling to teen-age boys, but we know we also have to sell to the moms and the dads,\" Robert Botch, Sega's marketing director, said of the spot, created by Della Femina, McNamee Inc. in Los Angeles. **********In previous years, the confluence of adult and child interest in Halloween has led to complaints from activist groups, which have contended that adult-oriented Halloween beer ads are actually also aimed at youngsters. **********Though the breweries have denied such charges, elements in their campaigns for 1991 reflect the activists' concerns. **********In the Coors Light spot, Elvira calls the brand \"just what an adult party needs to be a howling success.\" And the Miller Brewing Company is running a Halloween version of its continuing \"Think before you drink\" campaign, which encourages moderation in drinking; print ads and posters show Frankenstein's monster under the headline \"Keep a level head this Halloween.\" **********For those wondering how advertisers will try to lift their Halloween sales after they garner the adult and child markets, a newspaper ad from the Quaker Oats Company suggests that its Snausages and Pounce pet products make great Halloween treats for dogs and cats."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/30/business/us-notes-and-bonds-up-in-light-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Notes and Bonds Up in Light Trading", "print_headline": "U.S. Notes and Bonds Up in Light Trading", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose yesterday, and interest rates moved lower.

However, he denied reports that he had reprimanded them.  Most Were Americans **********The team's leader, David Kay, is an American. He was accompanied on the mission by Robert L. Gallucci, the Special Commission's American deputy executive chairman. Altogether, 25 of the 44 team members were Americans, and they included Government scientists with practical experience in nuclear weapons design. **********In particular, officials say that by sending reports directly to the United States Government, the Americans helped bolster the Iraqis'charge that Mr. Kay is a Central Intelligence Agency spy acting under cover of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency. **********\"We very firmly instructed them not to make such contacts but only to report to the Special Commission and the I.A.E.A.,\" Mr. Ekeus said today. **********Commission officials say that the Americans argued that they were only trying to get the substance of confiscated material out of the country quickly for fear that the Iraqis would take it back by force. **********At a news conference after the team's arrival in Bahrain today, Mr. Kay said that the inspectors had removed a total of 25,000 pages of documents dealing with Iraq's covert nuclear plans as well as 19 hours of videotape and 70 rolls of film used to photograph documents. **********\"I think we collected a lot of valuable information\" on Iraq's secret nuclear program,\" he said, adding: **********\"You can't help but be impressed by the sophistication of it.

That is a major anomaly.\" **********The team has also brought out records of nuclear material that Iraq purchased for its program from foreign countries and companies.

The new developments raise the prospect that the brokerage may face serious new penalties. **********Government officials also say they suspect that Nomura, the world's largest brokerage, provided improper compensation for trading losses to more of its customers than it has disclosed so far. **********The head of the Justice Ministry's criminal division had said in July that an investigation had begun into Nomura's dealings in the shares of the Tokyu Corporation, a big railroad and property group. Finance Ministry officials now say they have broadened their own investigation to examine the trading of Nomura's customers as well as the activities of the brokerage's branch offices, and will share their findings with the prosecutor's office. **********If Nomura is found to have engaged in manipulation, a criminal offense, the individuals involved could be sentenced to three-year prison terms and the firm could face an array of harsh administrative measures, the head of the ministry's enforcement division, Toshihiro Tsuchimochi, said. These include suspensions or even the revocation of its operating license. **********A revocation is considered unlikely, but even a far less harsh penalty could cause customers to flee and seriously damage the firm's reputation. **********One reason the investigations of Nomura have been suddenly upgraded is that the Finance Ministry is itself under growing pressure to demonstrate that it can deal with the issues raised in the scandal, which has damaged the ministry's credibility. **********Facing a barrage of criticism by opposition lawmakers in the Diet, Japan's Parliament, about its handling of the matter, the Finance Ministry has made threatening comments about Nomura even though it acknowledges that it has yet to prove a case. Many of the disclosures that have advanced the investigations have come in newspaper articles. **********The political pressures have created an unpredictable new dynamic in the scandal, as the Finance Ministry itself struggles to survive in its current form. Charges that the ministry has been an ineffective watchdog of the financial industry and that it is going too easy on Nomura and other firms have encouraged those who want to shift regulatory powers to an independent new agency. Disclosures that the ministry knew of some improper activities years ago, and yet did nothing, have made it as much a subject of the scandal as the securities firms. **********\"The ministry is really struggling not to come across as the bad guys, so they're trying to reach the correct conclusions before there is a formal conclusion from the investigations,\" said Robert Zielinski, an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities here. \"They're paying close attention to the political winds. They just want this thing to go away.\" **********Until recently, ministry officials had spent much of their time describing why they could not prosecute or penalize Nomura and the other major securities brokers.  Promises Are Forbidden **********Japanese law prohibits securities firms from promising to pay compensation to customers to cover losses, but not from actually making such payments. When it was disclosed that more than 20 large firms made improper loss-compensation payments of more than $1.3 billion, the ministry accepted their words that no promises had been offered in advance. **********It was disclosed on Monday that some firms, including Nomura, may have made improper compensation payments to customers that did not lose money. The implication was that the firms had guaranteed the customers a minimum return and that when they came up short, the firms made up the difference. Nobuhiko Matsuno, head of the securities bureau, said that the behavior looked suspicious and that the ministry was investigating. **********Perhaps the most curious case involves the investigation of Nomura's dealings in Tokyu stock.  No Evidence of Manipulation **********Minoru Nagaoka, the president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, insisted in July that the exchange had investigated trading in Tokyu shares in late 1989 and found nothing amiss. Finance Ministry officials also said that an investigation at that time had turned up no evidence of manipulation. **********Mr. Tsuchimochi, head of the enforcement division, said in a telephone interview today that a new investigation began into the Tokyu trading because of numerous newspaper articles. He said the 1989 inquiry had focused on whether a single customer had tried to manipulate Tokyu's shares, but not whether Nomura had been involved in the scheme. That is a focus of the current inquiry, he said. **********\"Basically, we have not found any evidence of a violation yet,\" he commented. \"But the investigation is continuing.\" **********It had been previously disclosed that Susumu Ishii, who until last year had headed one of Japan's largest organized crime groups, acquired more than 27 million Tokyu shares in the spring of 1989. Nomura and Nikko Securities had each provided more than $100 million in financing to back the purchases of Mr. Ishii, who died today at age 67.  [ Obituary, page B9. ] **********In October 1989, Nomura issued a strong buy recommendation to its branches for Tokyu, sending the stock price soaring. Setsuya Tabuchi, who was forced to resign as Nomura chairman because of the scandal, said in parliamentary testimony last week that Nomura had exceeded for a few days an informal prohibition against securities firms' accounting for more than 30 percent of the trading in a stock. But he denied that the firm had manipulated Tokyu shares. **********An opposition member of Parliament disclosed Monday that he had obtained a ministry report showing Mr. Ishii had earned nearly $6 million in profits by selling a small portion of his holdings near their price peak, when Nomura was recommending Tokyu.

But when he was transferred by the Army to Italy three years ago, his orders did not mention welding, and he suddenly found himself assigned as an infantryman. **********\"I was 18 and dumb and didn't complain,\" he said, tugging nervously on the zipper on his flame-retardant, olive-green tanker suit. **********Even though Corporal Gilman says he has come to accept his fate here, his anxiety was transparent as he waited for what appeared to be an imminent order to charge across The Berm. **********Pvt. Michael Anthony O'Donnell of New Hyde Park, L.I., turns 22 next week. He left his job as a truck driver and joined the Army in May, \"looking for a little discipline, a little adventure.\" On the day he graduated from basic training at Fort Knox, Ky., Iraq invaded Kuwait, a faraway country he said he had never heard of. **********Six months later, he was standing on the sandy border of that country, risking his life to liberate it. **********\"I can feel it breathing down my neck,\" he said of the war, his left hand resting near large gray plastic containers of armor-piercing ammunition. \"I'd like to come home in one piece. I can't wait to get out of here.\"  One Combat Veteran on Team **********The one combat veteran on this Bradley team is the commander, 39-year-old Sgt. Ron Mullinix. **********He describes his team as \"a good bunch of men\" and insists that he is confident of a quick victory against Iraq. **********\"I think it's going to be quick and deliberate,\" he said. \"My best guess is that it will take a month. My hope is that it's a week.\" **********But Sergeant Mullinix served in Vietnam, and he says that in many ways, the war against Iraq \"ain't no easier\" to fight. **********He said that in Vietnam he learned a difficult lesson about battle, and it applies here, too. \"You start pumped up, you go into it scared to death, and you come out of it wondering what you did,\" he said. **********First Lieut. Paul Calvert, 27, of Athens, Ga., directs the men of the \"Merchants of Death,\" and he does not deny that there is fear in what may be the final hours before battle. **********\"There's always a fear factor,\" he said. \"You've got to be cognizant of the fear factor in yourself.\" **********But he said he chose an assignment in the Second Armored Cavalry, an elite regiment that dates back to the 1830's and led the advance for Patton's Third Army in World War II, and \"I feel safer in this unit than any other place in the war.\" **********Lieutenant Calvert said he knew that battle would be easier for him than for many of his soldiers, if only because he can share his fear with his older brother, Capt. Mark Calvert, 29, who works in the regimental headquarters a short drive south from The Berm. **********\"I've always got somebody I can grab hold of,\" Lieutenant Calvert said. \"We've always had so much in common. We've passed for twins.\"  A New Bond for Brothers **********The war, he said, offers them \"the kind of bond a lot of brothers never experience.\" **********Both brothers are married, and the families live only 45 minutes apart in Germany, where the regiment is based. Mark has two daughters. Paul's wife is pregnant with their first child. **********Their father died years ago. \"And my mom's real worried,\" Lieutenant Calvert said. \"I know from letters she is extremely proud of us. She's got faith in us. She's got faith in our abilities.\" **********As for his brother, Paul says he believes that Mark would prefer to break away from the safer confines of the regimental headquarters and come here to The Berm, to lead the attack, the brothers side by side. **********\"I know he'd want to be here,\" Lieutenant Calvert said proudly of his brother. \"He's an outstanding soldier, and this is why we joined the Army.

In Chicago, the Lithuanian flag hung over the Seklycia Restaurant, and the refrains of \"God Bless Latvia\" rose from the corridors of a Latvian church. **********It was a day of joy and disbelief, but also one of disappointment that the United States, the embodiment of freedom to so many of their relatives in the Baltics, was among the last of the Western countries to recognize their independence. **********\"We would have been happier to see the President lead instead of follow,\" said the Rev. Vilis Varsbergs of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church. **********\"It was so painful for us to watch our cousins standing up to the tanks for freedom,\" Ms. Narvsis added. \"For us not to be first was hard for many of us to take.\" **********That did not stop them from hugging and toasting themselves. The Lithuanians on the South Side and the Latvians on the North Side had been up since 5 A.M., preparing for the celebration, bracing for the President's words.

Maybe there will be a civil war. There will be a lot of mess yet.\" **********He remembered a visit he made to Siberia 12 years ago, where he saw the fruit of division ripe even then. \"People were saying, 'We are Ukranians or we are Cossacks.' Never fighting for the Soviet Union.\" **********For decades now, the Latvians and Lithuanians and Estonians in this country have worked on the same team in the fight for independence, in marches and rallies and in letter-writing campaigns. Today they went their separate ways to celebrate and are likely, some noted, to find themselves rivals for scarce development resources now that freedom has come. **********\"Now there may be more competition to decide which country is going to get what and how much,\" said Dr. Tomas Remeikis, a political science professor who lives in Chicago and is Lithuanian. \"Things might even get nasty.\" **********To avert such an outcome, many say their lobbying efforts will focus on gaining technical and humanitarian aid for the Baltics and pressing the United States to grant their homelands the status of most-favored nations. Some Baltic Americans are already planning trips to reclaim family land that was confiscated and used by the Soviet Government or talking of quitting jobs to help rebuild the countries. **********The day, as joyous as it was, had its sadder moments as well, as these expatriates, many of them survivors of the Red Army purge of intellectuals and capitalist sympathizers after World War II, remembered the relatives who could not share it with them. **********\"We survived, but so many didn't,\" said Olita Kins, Mr. Kins's wife. **********Her grandmother, Marija Kakis, lived for the day when shecould see Latvia free and again touch a son who was exiled to Siberia for 25 years. **********\"She always said, 'Someday we'll go back,' \" Mrs. Kins said. \"She said she couldn't die until she saw her son and Latvia.\" **********She would not live to see either.

Eckerd offered to buy the company and bring it out of its bankruptcy reorganization effort; Revco filed a plan for reorganization on June 7. **********Despite the rejection, the offer has the support of some of Revco's creditors, and it could still succeed. The offer came about because a committee of one group of Revco's creditors, frustrated with the reorganization's slow pace, asked Eckerd to bid, people involved in the bankruptcy said. Value Not Disclosed **********The total value of the offer was not disclosed. But in a recent court hearing, a Revco lawyer estimated that the company had a value of about $835 million. An adviser to one of the creditor committees, however, said the market was putting the value of all of Revco's securities at about $340 million. **********\"While we have not received a formal response to our proposal, we have been told the information requested would not be forthcoming at this time,\" Eckerd's chairman, Stewart Turley, said in a statement. Revco's management has reportedly refused to turn over financial information Eckard said it would need to proceed with the offer. **********David Supino, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company, Revco's investment banker, said in a statement that \"most creditors of Revco have expressed their belief that they would receive more value in a stand-alone reorganization plan\" than through an acquisition like the one offered by Eckerd. **********People who have been briefed on the proposed deal said yesterday that Merrill Lynch & Company was helping Eckerd and that Merrill would be taking a financial position in Revco if the deal worked out. **********While it has been protected from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, Revco has turned in a dismal sales performance, racking up losses of about $400 million and compounding its creditors' frustrations. **********A bid for the company would be an added factor in what has evolved into one of the most complex bankruptcies stemming from the wave of mergers in the 1980's. Revco was taken private in 1986 in a deal that increased its debt level by $1.1 billion. A little more than a year later, the company failed to make payments on its debt and filed for bankruptcy.  Earlier Offers **********This is not the first time outside bidders have tried to buy Revco, according to documents filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio. In 1989 and 1990, the company was approached with a bid of $925 million, which was dimissed at the time as inadequate by investors with a financial stake in Revco. **********Revco's own plan faces difficulty because of the reaction among creditors, court documents show. Revco said it had submitted that plan based on the \"hardened positions of the various creditor constituencies\" in recent negotiations. **********For Eckerd, the proposed deal would tighten its already close corporate relationship with Revco. Last year, Eckerd bought 223 Revco stores, as Revco tried to emerge from bankruptcy protection. **********But Revco is a much different company from what it was when it began its reorganization three years ago. The company, which operated more than 2,000 drugstores in 30 states in 1986, has sold many of them during the bankruptcy. It now owns 1,100 stores with about $2.5 billion in annual revenues. **********Eckerd, a private company based in Clearwater, Fla., owns 1,680 drugstores in 13 states.

Some especially severe cases have been independently substantiated and widely publicized, including attacks with chemical weapons on Kurdish villagers at Halabja during the war between Iran and Iraq. Relative Freedom **********But the graves and other recent discoveries offer evidence of the wide extent of Baghdad's repression. They are coming to light now that the Kurds have been left relatively free to run their affairs and rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the American-led military effort to protect them from Mr. Hussein's forces. **********Baghdad crushed a Kurdish uprising in the aftermath of its defeat in the Persian Gulf war, forcing hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee for months into Iran and Turkey. **********\"When we first complained about these human rights violations the world did not listen,\" said Jalal Talabani, one of two top Kurdish guerrilla leaders. \"Now that we come forward with the evidence, this information is harder to ignore.\" Indiscriminate Killing Charged **********Kurdish leaders contend that more than 180,000 people have disappeared in the last decade at the hands of the Iraqi secret police. They say the Iraqis killed anyone, including young children, who they believe supported the outlawed Kurdish guerrilla movement or who belonged to a family that had ties with the Kurdish rebels. **********[ Diplomats at Iraq's mission to the United Nations, its highest-level diplomatic presence in the United States, could not be reached for comment on the new evidence of abuses. Middle East Watch, a New York-based human rights group, said it was planning to send investigators to northern Iraq to look into the Kurds' accusations. ] **********When confronted in the past with charges of mass killings or abuses of Kurds, Iraqi officials have in general denied wrongdoing, saying that any actions in the region would have been carried out against inflitrators from Iran or against traitors. **********Iraqi officials have also pointed to at least one mass killing by Kurdish guerrillas in October, when 60 Iraqi soldiers who surrendered during skirmishes in the Sulaimaniya area were slain by their Kurdish captors, according to the account of a Reuters reporter. Kurdish leaders promised to investigate the killings and bring those guilty to justice, but the investigation has yet to produce any results. **********Of graves being uncovered in northern Iraq, some reflect vilagers' return only now to the ruins of communities destroyed under an Iraqi policy of forced mass relocation begun in 1976. **********More than 4,000 villages -- primarily those near the Turkish or Iranian borders that were regarded as sanctuaries for Kurdish rebels -- are believed to have been demolished under the program, which reached its peak of intensity in 1987 and 1988, toward the end of the Iran-Iraq war. **********Other mass graves are thought to be more recent. At one, on Kalowa Hill here in Sulaimaniya, Pershan Hassan clambered quickly up the dirt track leading to the site. **********As she hurried forward, she clutched to her chest a framed black and white picture of a young boy. At the top of the rise, a crowd that had gathered parted silently as she stumbled forward. 'By His Clothes' **********The 53-year-old woman suddenly stopped and let out a gasp of pain and recognition. Before her, nine years after he disappeared from a schoolyard, lay the skeletal remains of her 13-year-old son, Shafiq. **********A faded blue blindfold was tightly wrapped around his skull and spent bullets were scattered among his now dark brown bones. **********\"I know him by his clothes,\" she whispered, her voice breaking as she lifted the garments and kissed them. \"I raised him without a father.\" **********The mass grave on Kalowa Hill is believed to hold the remains of dozens of people. **********\"Prisoners and collaborators who dug the mass graves tell us where they are located,\" said Aras Mohammed Garib, who is in charge of the digging around the city, \"but many have fled or are dead. It will be a long time before we really know the extent of all this.\" Kurdish Zones **********The Kurdistan Front, umbrella group for eight Kurdish groups in northern Iraq, has domain over most of the area above the 36th parallel. The region, home to about three and a half million, is part of a security zone established in April by American forces. **********The Kurds also control territory below the zone, including the city of Sulaimaniya, although the Iraqis appear to be positioning themselves to take back it and other cities as autonomy talks with the Kurds have bogged down. **********In gathering evidence, Kurdish officials here each morning pore through stacks of documents that they said were seized from police files, including photographs and videotapes of torture and death. **********The long, typewritten lists chronicle killing after killing, sometimes for what seem to be trivial offenses. One man was sentenced to death because he had a picture of a rebel Kurdish leader in his wallet. **********The killing sites are often found a few feet from the mass graves, Kurds say. On Kalowa Hill, five tires filled with cement are all that remain of the spot where apparently many people were shot to death. Earthen embankments border the back and either side of the site. **********Prisoners, apparently blindfolded with their hands tied behind 10-foot metal poles, were planted in the cement and then shot. **********A picture taken from police files shows what appear to be three Iraqi officials squatting like big game hunters next to the slumped body of a man who was recently killed. One of the Iraqis, wearing a beret, is grins while holding a knife to the corpse's neck. **********Those who lived in the vicinity of Kalowa Hill said they often heard screams and volleys of shots, but were threatened with death if they tried to peer into the high-walled compound. **********\"The dogs used to come back with human bones, after getting inside the compound,\" said Yasin Khader Hassan, 25. \"Then the guards began to shoot even the dogs.\" A Woman's Agony **********The hill now draws women looking for lost children or husbands. The plaintive cries of those who recover the remains of their loved ones rise above the murmur of the crowd. **********One woman, Bahia Khader, kneeled over the bones of her son Sirwan, who disappeared in 1982 when he was 15. **********\"Sirwan, Sirwan,\" she cried, swaying over the bones and bits of clothing of her child. \"By the hands of these criminals, you have been taken from me.\" **********Those who survived life inside Iraqi detention centers describe torture, beatings, hunger and the severance of all contact with the outside world. **********Jamal Aziz Amin, a courtly 45-year-old headmaster, stood in a soundproof room in the darkened remains of Sulaimaniya's central security prison, where he spent a year in detention. **********Large hooks hang from the ceiling where Mr. Amin was suspended during torture. He was handcuffed behind his back, he said, and hoisted onto the hooks at the wrist. He said he was stripped, questioned about his ties to Kurdish guerrilla groups, and given electric shocks until he fell unconcious. Revenge Taken **********\"You would scream,\" he said, \"and it would sound as if you were yelling from the bottom of a deep, deep well.\" **********The huge prison, its tiers of cells piled one on top of the other, stands bleak and deserted in the Baghdad suburb of Shorish. When it was attacked in March by Kurdish fighters and enraged civilians, 300 secret policemen and guards, including the warden, held out for three days. None of the defenders survived, Kurds say. **********Mr. Amin and his fellow prisoners, after the attack, had the rare experience of standing over the bodies of many of their torturers. **********\"We wanted them to all come back to life,\" he said, \"so we could kill them again.\" **********At the prison, inmates subsisted on thin soup, bread and weak tea. Mr. Amin said that when he was released, he had lost 60 pounds. Prison Graffiti **********The walls of the cells, many marked with crudely drawn calendars, carry the messages of those who tried to leave some testament of their humanity, some record of their suffering. **********\"These were my friends, arrested with me,\" Ahmed Mohammed wrote, listing five names. \"All were executed.\" **********Another prisoner had written a message to his mother: \"Oh, mother,\" in this dark room my dreams trouble me and I shake. Then comes the kicking against my door and a voice telling me to get up. It is time for my interrogation. I awake to the unconscious.\" **********Mr. Amin wound his way to the crude latrine, a hole in the cement, at the end of a corridor of cells. **********\"I wanted to show you this,\" he said, a small shaft of light streaming in from a tiny, barred window 14 feet above him. \"Here is where we would come at night so we could pull ourselves up the walls to hear the sound of the dogs barking in the distance. To hear the dogs, this was everything for us.\" **********U.S. EXPRESSES CONCERN **********WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (Reuters) -- The United States expressed concern today at a renewed Kurdish refugee crisis in northern Iraq.   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said: \"The United Nations people there on the ground tell us they believe they can handle this situation. It is something that is a concern to us, and something that we are obviously watching closely.\" **********United Nations officials say about 200,000 Kurds have fled attacks by the Iraqi Army in northern Iraq in recent weeks, straining the resources of relief teams trying to help half a million uprooted people survive an icy winter. **********President Saddam Hussein crushed a Kurdish revolt in the aftermath of Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war earlier this year. Up to two million refugees fled toward Turkey and Iran, and Western troops created safe havens in Iraq for their return.

Baker 3d, seem to have chosen that tactic as a continuing element in their approach to the knotty problem of relations with the new, multi-polar Soviet Union, which bears about as much resemblence to the old monolithic totalitarian state of Stalin and Brezhnev as television-era American politics do to those of Tammany Hall. **********Having hinted for weeks that it strongly opposed inviting President Mikahil S. Gorbachev to the economic summit meeting in London in mid-July, and thus having dampened whatever plans Moscow may have had for stampeding Western leaders into early commitments of enormous financial aid, the Administration dropped its objections to Mr. Gorbachev coming to London next month. Naming of Strauss **********Having said again and again that before settling into a new business relationship with Moscow he wanted more dramatic evidence of the Soviets' commitment to changes leading to a free-market economy, Mr. Bush chose Robert S. Strauss, a symbol of free-market trade if ever there was one, as his new Ambassador to the Soviet Union. **********Casting aside doubts as to whether the feeble Soviet economy still meets the legal definition of a credit-worthy buyer, the President has now authorized the $1.5 billion in agricultural credits Mr. Gorbachev has been seeking, and he has committed himself to sending to Capitol Hill in the next week or so the enabling measure that would grant preferential trade terms to Moscow. **********The effect of this flurry of activity, which has also included the clarification of disputed terms of the new treaty covering conventional forces in Europe, has been to assist the Soviet leader in significant ways while the Administration and Congress ponder the larger question of how much money the United States should provide to help rebuild the Soviet economy. 'Big Bang' Ruled Out **********Mr. Baker said in a speech in Copenhagen last week that the United States has ruled out the so-called \"big bang\" approach to helping Moscow. **********In each case, Mr. Bush has made himself look more flexible, more generous, than he might have seemed had he not at first held back. Relatively small, relatively inexpensive symbolic acts have assumed added weight. That suits his purposes, because while he is eager to help Mr. Gorbachev, whom he greatly admires, he is not eager to commit the United States too deeply too quickly. **********Resources are scarce. Demands for domestic spending are rising. But most important of all, even the very near-term future in the Soviet Union is hard to read. On Wednesday, for example, Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's principal rival, is likely to win election as President of the Russian republic, putting a skilled political operator with a popular mandate at the helm of the most important consitutent unit of the Soviet Union, with all that implies for Mr. Gorbachev, who has no such mandate. **********If he wins, Washington expects a visit from Mr. Yeltsin, an earthy populist, sometime next week. Mr. Bush is reportedly planning to meet with him in the Oval Office -- an act that will be widely and probably correctly read as a hedging of bets. Further hedging will be needed until it is clear what is going to happen in the Baltic states, the republics in central Asia and those along the sensitive southern border of the Soviet Union, all of which have been growing restive. Arms Talks Stalled **********It seems reasonable to ask now whether Mr. Bush is doing the same thing in the long-stalled strategic missile negotiations, which constitute the last major impediment to a summit meeting in Moscow this summer. The White House said on Monday that the meeting would probably have to be held in late July instead of late June, as originally envisioned. Did that reflect a genuine substantive hang-up, an attempt to bring pressure on the Soviets to soften their arms-reduction position in the hope that a Moscow meeting would bring more economic relief, or an attempt to make an eventual breakthrough look more dramatic? Perhaps a bit of each. **********Few in Washington will be suprised, given the startling cascade of events in recent weeks, if an arms agreement suddenly emerges from one of Mr. Baker's talks with his Soviet counterpart, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, such as their meeting in Berlin next week. A summit date would almost surely be set shortly thereafter. But the Administration, ever loath to raise hopes too much, lest it appear to have failed, keeps talking about the difficult path ahead. **********The agricultural credits are similar to those extended last December at a time when famine was a genuine threat in Soviet cities. Like those, they will cost the American taxpayer nothing unless Moscow defaults -- a major plus for the President, who can seem generous while not pushing himself further into a financial corner at home. **********In the six months since December, even credits have become more controversial. The increasingly feeble Soviet economy makes a default seem more likely, and partisans of the Baltic states in this country, including Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader, have expressed fears that grain bought with the credits might be witheld from the Lithuanians and other critics of the Gorbachev Government. But they are less risky, Mr. Bush clearly concluded, than most other gestures currently available to him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-715091.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Jon Baker, 39 years old, has been promoted to chairman of the southeast division of Earle Palmer Brown, Bethesda, Md., from executive vice president-corporate development.

That is causing growing concern in moderate Arab countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia as well as among Western security officials. **********Saudi, Egyptian and American officials have said in interviews that over the last few months Iran has sent between 1,000 and 2,000 of its Revolutionary Guards to train Sudanese Army and security personnel in the Sudan, even as Teheran continues to reduce the Revolutionary Guards contingent in the Bekaa region of Lebanon. **********Western and Arab intelligence officials say that at least a dozen training camps have been set up in the Sudan over the last few months in which Islamic fundamentalist militants from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and the Persian Gulf region are being trained for subversive activities. **********The officials say the Iranian Government has also supplied at least $17 million worth of military equipment to the Sudanese military dictatorship, headed by Lieut.

He has a wide following in the Arab world. As the leader of the National Islamic Front Organization and a fervent supporter of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, he is reckoned by Arab and Western intelligence services to have total control of the Government of General Bashir and senior commanders of the Sudanese Army. **********\"There is absolutely no question that Tourabi runs the Sudan and that his present tactic rests on pushing his wider ambitions for a pan-Arab and African base,\" said Elsir Sayed Ahmad, a Sudanese who is a columnist for the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al Awsat. **********Sudanese officials, including the chief of intelligence and security services, Nafei Ali Nafei, often visit Teheran and are known to receive regular training in intelligence and covert operations there, American and Arab intelligence officials said. **********In a move cementing the relationship between the two countries, President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran is heading a delegation of 150 Iranians that is to begin an official visit to the Sudan on Friday.

It seemed to embody the American corporation's ability to innovate and to capitalize on cost-cutting research. As the industry brought powerful computers within the reach of businesses and households, bountiful profits were generated for the companies and their investors. **********But now the industry, and particularly its leaders -- Apple Computer, Compaq and I.B.M. -- face a real test. A squeeze at both ends of their market has sent their profits plummeting. The question is whether they can define strategies that will help them break out of the industry stall and produce the kind of growth and profitability they are used to.  'The Desktop Is Dead' **********\"The secular problem is the desktop is dead,\" said Roger McNamee, an industry analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. \"The PC industry is mature, and MS-DOS is aging,\" he added, referring to the operating system that is used by the majority of I.B.M. and I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. \"The only things that are growing are graphical interface, portable computers and network computing. If you don't have two out of three, you're dead.\" **********Of course, personal computers -- the boxy desktop variety -- continue to sell in some numbers, but they are rapidly becoming commodity products. Buyers are frequently passing up the name brands for less expensive models. This has forced Apple, Compaq and the International Business Machines Corporation, which have commanded premium prices, to slash prices to compete with the likes of the Dell Computer Corporation and AST Research Inc., which make powerful, reliable clones. **********\"In the last few months we've started to see little companies like Northgate and Zeos and DTK in our survey questionnaires,\" said Dan Ness Jr., a researcher at a company that tracks corporate computer buyers, the Computer Intelligence Corporation of La Jolla, Calif. \"A year ago if you asked me if it's a commodity market, I would have said, 'no way.' Now that people are realizing that standards are well established they are shifting whom they buy from.\" **********As the leading desktop makers are being undercut at the bottom, they are also encountering problems at the high end of their lines. The new Intel 486 microprocessor chip has allowed them to produce desktops fast and powerful enough to compete with work stations, which are more powerful desktop computers that in the past have generally been used for engineering and scientific tasks. But the desktops are still losing out to the work stations, since the software and operating systems available for work stations are superior. **********For a while, the slowdown in desktop sales was seen by many as a function of the weakening economy. But as it became increasingly apparent that the market softness was tied to more fundamental changes in the industry, the computer makers began to focus on reshaping their strategies. **********\"There is no question that there has been a slowdown in the industry and we don't see any signs that it's really coming back soon,\" said James A. Cannavino, an I.B.M. vice president and general manager of the company's personal systems division. \"We're ending one era and heading into another.\" **********One sign of that change is that archrivals I.B.M. and Apple have begun discussing a potential alliance. Last month, I.B.M.'s president, Jack D. Kuehler, visited Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The companies discussed a variety of possible technology exchanges in personal computers. These included licensing by I.B.M. of its RS/6000 chip technology to Apple, and Apple licensing some of its software to I.B.M. **********Each of these is a strength the other needs. The RS/6000 is a microprocessor I.B.M. uses in its work station business that may have applications for future personal computers. **********For I.B.M., using Apple's software would allow it to try to differentiate its machines more from those of competitors. Until now, it has used software jointly developed with Microsoft, but has been unhappy that Microsoft has had so much control over the direction of personal computer software. **********The source of many of the industry's current problems can be tracked to limitations found in the microprocessor chip that was the heart of the first I.B.M. personal computer introduced in 1981. At that time, I.B.M. chose the 8088 chip produced by the Intel Corporation, even though many computer experts considered an alternative chip, the Motorola Corporation's 68000, to be technically superior. **********The 8088 chip could use only a limited amount of computer memory, and it seemed adequate at the time. Later, however, it became the Achilles' heel of the I.B.M. and compatible computer makers. **********Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system was designed around those limits. By contrast, early work stations were built around chips made by Motorola, without the memory limits. As a result, the work station world has been able to develop more advanced software. **********The conventional wisdom once was that the MS-DOS operating system, on which Microsoft and I.B.M. built the business marketplace, would last forever. But that has proved inaccurate. The traditional MS-DOS market has trailed off rapidly and the remaining upgrade business from 16- to 32-bit computers and from character-based to graphical systems based on programs like Microsoft's Windows has not covered the decline. Shift Was Predicted **********Many veteran industry executives said that the upheaval had been long overdue. **********\"I've been predicting this for some time,\" said Gordon Bell, a leading industry computer designer. \"The surprise is that it took so long before the brutality of it happened. The guys who have gotten less efficient, like Compaq, were obvious targets.\" **********While personal computer makers have continued to innovate, many have been slow to push beyond the original single-application uses like word processing and spreadsheets, which drove the industry in the early 1980's. **********\"There is a shift inside the industry,\" said Andrew Grove, Intel's president. \"The center of gravity is increasingly moving to group or community computing.\" **********No one seems to have been well insulated from the changes, although some of the companies hurt most say they see opportunities. For the moment, though, they are all scrambling to refashion their strategies -- restructuring, as well as looking for markets with high growth potential like mobile notebook and pentop computing.  Leaders Aren't Leaving **********The three industry leaders are not leaving the field. In fact all are trying to either create new markets or expand existing ones. Each is taking a somewhat different tack. **********I.B.M., the most broadly diversified of the PC manufacturers, is hoping that it will be able to use sophisticated software to differentiate it from the pack of clone makers. It is gambling that a new version of its OS/2 operating system, which has languished until now, will eventually be an industry hit and permit the company to tie personal computers more closely to its large commercial systems. It has also recently entered the notebook market and re-entered the home computer market. **********But Mr. Cannavino, the I.B.M. vice president, argues that his company should benefit if corporate customers shift their buying to systems that work together. \"Computing in the future will require a systems and support structure that is more substantial,\" Mr. Cannavino said. \"We have lots of experience doing this.\" **********If I.B.M. sees its future in moving upscale, Compaq has a different vision. The rapid shift in the industry appears to have caught the Houston-based company by surprise. **********Compaq originally made its name by cloning I.B.M.'s personal computer, but it has been slow to differentiate itself from the commodity part of the market. Now it is attempting to re-create the phenomenon of the clone companies with a new line of machines that will match the abilities of the work station makers. **********To do this, it has struck up an alliance with 20 other computer and software companies, including the Digital Equipment Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation, Silicon Graphics Inc. and the MIPS Computer Company, to define a new standard for advanced personal computers. The group, known as the Advanced Computing Environment, has defined a new standard aimed at creating a new generation of personal computers that will share information effectively and have powerful graphics features. **********Apple has yet another strategy. In October 1990, it embarked on a quest for growth in the low-cost consumer market, a strategy it has consciously avoided since its founding in 1977. **********To accommodate this strategy and still squeeze out the kind of profits it made when it had the freedom to price its computers above those of other PC makers, it has had to push down costs. It has already announced that it will cut employment 10 percent. And on Friday, the company confirmed that it is considering cutting executive pay by 10 percent. **********But it is exploring other new markets, too, from palm-top computers to mobile consumer appliances. It has invested in General Magic Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up led by former Macintosh developers. The company is trying to develop a portable software system that will have the same influence that the Macintosh has had on the desktop.  New Uses of Computers **********What will determine the success or failure of all of these efforts, industry executives say, is the degree to which these companies are able to offer significant technical innovations that permit new uses of computers. For example, with the introduction of its System 7 operating system earlier this month, Apple has a substantial advantage in developing new applications. **********I.B.M. will introduce a new version of its OS/2 operating system later this year. Microsoft's competing version of OS/2 will not be available until sometime next year. **********As these companies pursue their strategies, one thing seems certain: profit margins will continue to erode before new approaches bear fruit. **********In fact, declining profitability is likely to be a persistent problem in the personal computer industry for the foreseeable future. The Gartner Group forecasts that beginning this year, the volume in personal computer shipments will rise 16 percent annually, from the 10 percent annual growth seen over the last five years. But it expects revenues to grow by only 13 percent, down from 21 percent annually from 1985 to 1990."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/11/world/war-in-the-gulf-war-notebook-to-saddam-hussein-with-ill-wishes.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1991-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: War Notebook; To Saddam Hussein, With Ill Wishes", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: War Notebook; To Saddam Hussein, With Ill Wishes", "body_text": " **********Defense Secretary Dick Cheney flashed a wicked smile, grabbed the big black marking pen and sent something less than his best wishes to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. **********\"To Saddam,\" Mr. Cheney wrote on the 2,000-pound bomb destined for an Iraqi target. \"With appreciation.

They could not even specify if the base was in the northern, southern, eastern or western part of the country. **********Airmen at the base are not allowed to call home to the United States for fear they might be overheard on open phone lines discussing the abilities and the exact mission of the Stealth, which is being used for bombing raids on Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.  For the Children **********Bingo night held a special significance last week on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, now cruising in the gulf. All proceeds went to the families of three Navy pilots who failed to return to the carrier from raids on Iraq. **********Lieut. Cmdr. Tom Hammon of Baytown, Tex., organized the fund-raising drive, which is intended to educate the four children of the missing fliers. More than $8,000 has been collected so far. **********\"It was something to see, a petty officer third class walking in with $20 bills still warm from the cash machine, giving two weeks' pay to kids of men he'd never met,\" said Commander Hammon, a maintenance officer in the carrier's fighter wing. **********\"The guy just handed me the money and tried to walk away before I could shake his hand,\" he told an American pool reporter. \"That's the kind of people we have here.\" **********Commander Hammon said the four children were an 11-year-old, a 3-year-old and twins a year and a half old. He would not identify the children by name or sex, out of concern that someone might harass their mothers. \"We take care of our own,\" he said.  A Price on Their Head **********The price on the head of a pro-Iraqi terrorist in Saudi Arabia just went up. **********The Saudi Government has announced it will pay one million Saudi rials, or about $278,000, to anyone who provides \"information on subversives or their accomplices.\" **********The price paid by the terrorist remains the same. Under the Sharia, the Muslim code that is law in Saudi Arabia, conviction on charges of murder or attempted murder can result in a public beheading or removal of limbs.  Small, Slow, Deadly **********More on the Stealth fighters: Few Americans have ever been given the opportunity to see one of these remarkable planes up close, and for American journalists who viewed the squadron today at a Saudi air base, a few myths about the plane were exploded. **********Despite photographs in newspapers and magazines that would tend to make it look like one of aviation's behemoths, the Stealth is actually quite small, about the same size as an F-15 jet fighter. The Stealth is 65 feet long and 12 feet high, with a wingspan of 43 feet. **********It is also, by standards of the American military jet fleet, quite slow. The Stealth flies at subsonic speeds. **********Sgt. Bobby Shelton, a spokesman for the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing, which flies the Stealth here and in the United States, said the beauty of the plane was, of course, its ability to evade radar and to hit targets with what he described as \"pinpoint accuracy.\" **********The war in the gulf is its first big test in combat, \"and we've performed flawlessly,\" he said. Secretary Cheney said today that the Stealth was one of the department's \"great success stories of recent years.\" **********Air Forces officials acknowledge that the plane was not tested as it might have been. Iraq's air defense operations were largely knocked out in the first days of the war, negating much of the need for the Stealth's special abilities. **********At least one of the Stealth pilots who met with Mr. Cheney today complained that his fighter appeared to be cursed. The pilot, Maj. Lee Guston, said his fighter had been nicknamed Christine, for the killer car of Stephen King horror-novel fame. **********\"It's just a jinxed jet sometimes,\" the major said. \"We've had some electrical anomalies, but we keep her flying.\" **********Whatever the problems, it should be noted that along Christine's side were the stenciled shapes of 11 bombs, meaning that the plane had completed 11 successful bombing missions over Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.  Today's Souvenir **********The world turns. The stories change. **********A German television journalist posted a sign in a hotel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, this weekend offering a piece of the demolished Berlin Wall -- a souvenir of last year's big story -- for a piece of a American-made Patriot defense missile. **********The Patriots have become press darlings in recent weeks after knocking several Iraqi Scud missiles out of the sky over Israel and eastern Saudi Arabia.  THE F-117A STEALTH FIGHTER The first brief details and a photograph of the F-117A were provided by the Defense Department on Nov. 10, 1988, although the fighter had been under development for more than 10 years. Its swept back wings and angular, pyramid-shaped fuselage are designed to keep the plane from being detected by radar. In addition, the surface is covered with radar absorbing materials. The F-117A was first used in the U.S. operation to overthrow Panama's military government in December 1989. Six fighters flew from their base at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada to Panama, refueling in air, and two of them each dropped a laser-guided bomb on two barracks at Rio Hato. First flight: June 1981. First use in combat: Dec. 21, 1989, Panama. Crew: Pilot only.

Opposition Has Been Growing **********Vocal opposition to the plan has been growing, and today the Government reported the first instance of popular protest, which halted railroad service for a few hours in Samtrediya, a city in Georgia. Some dissidents are proposing widespread nonviolent disobedience, but it is not yet clear that the fledgling opposition movement can manage such an effort. **********Critics say the actual motive of the Kremlin military patrols is to crimp political dissent, not economic crime. Sergei S. Stankevich, deputy chairman of the insurgent-led Moscow City Council, said that Moscow's streets were orderly and had no need of troop patrols. The measures, he said, are probably a prelude to additional hard-line economic and social changes being planned by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********As the deadline for the tougher policing measures approached, the Kremlin denied that the military patrols were intended for anything but \"to prevent crime on the streets and insure citizens' safety.\" Moscow military officials said that while the use of tanks and armored personnel carriers was an option under the new plan, these would be kept in reserve on the grounds of city garrisons. **********\"I don't care how they say it -- this is martial law,\" one Muscovite said in a conversation, summarizing the public's widespread skepticism about the Kremlin's use of troops as police, to be used wherever and whenever Government officials decide they are necessary. Gorbachev Responds to Critics **********That measure, plus a related one allowing the K.G.B.'s police investigators widespread authority to look into personal and business relations for evidence of crime, have been denounced as unconstitutional. Responding to criticism that the measures are dictatorial, Mr. Gorbachev today signed a presidential order reaffirming the military city patrols and asserting that they were legal under his recently broadened emergency powers. **********Tension over the heightening of central Kremlin power has been growing across the nation ever since a bloody crackdown on the Baltic independence movement began earlier this month with Mr. Gorbachev's blessing. He followed this up by authorizing stronger K.G.B. and military powers in the civilian sphere, proposing limits on the non-government press and suddenly banning 100-ruble and 50-ruble notes. **********This increased public alarm over the economy, particularly over price increases for \"food and other luxury items,\" as one newspaper sardonically put it.

Using the details in the letter -- names, account numbers and records of money transfers -- federal and state prosecutors are investigating possible tax evasion linked to reported insider trading. **********Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank and a behemoth in the nation's bank-dominated securities market, is pursuing its own internal investigation, a spokesman said. On July 5, the bank dismissed Manfred Mertens, its 30-year-old chief options trader, saying he violated unspecified \"internal rules not related to trading and sales.\" The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is also investigating. **********Until now, Germans assured themselves that a gentleman's agreement was sufficient to prevent insider trading, which is deemed unethical but not criminal. In the rare case where someone was caught violating the unwritten code, the result has always been a slap on the wrist, a quick return to business as usual and a few disapproving articles in the national press calling for better regulation. A Clamor for Change **********Those calls have now become a clamor. \"Everyone here wants laws making insider trading a criminal offense,\" said Rudiger von Rosen, chairman of the Federation of German Stock Exchanges and managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \"We are working on them, but it takes time. It must, and will, happen by the middle of 1992. That is the mandate we are working under from the European Community.\" **********But Mr. von Rosen minimized the current investigations. \"There is no scandal here. There are only competing accusations in the media, nothing more,\" he said. **********Rather than closing ranks as it has in the past, the city's banking community is bitterly split over securities trading practices. Adding to the tension are rumors that the Frankfurt state prosecutor will soon expand his inquiry to include other banks as well as independent stock traders. **********Helmut Hartmann, chief spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said in a newspaper interview that he did not think insider trading was any more of a problem at Deutsche Bank than at any other bank. That drew irate responses from other bankers. **********\"It irks me,\" said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. \"If Deutsche Bank is successful with something, they present it as a wonderful new discovery. But when they run into a problem, they say it is shared by the entire German banking sector, even though our bank and others have completely different internal controls than they do.\" Borrowing to Invest **********At Deutsche Bank, employees can borrow an amount equal to one year's salary to speculate in the securities markets, a spokesman said, and traders are not required to clear their trades immediately, but can wait in some cases until the following day. That allows major investors to conceal the size of their positions from the market and does not give the market the latest information about prices at which securites are actually changing hands. **********By contrast, Commerzbank employees must route their stock trades through the bank's personnel department, which has a special unit to monitor in-house securities trading, and traders, analysts and other potential insiders are barred from borrowing to conduct their personal trades. **********Deutsche Bank is said to be weighing a change in its house rules, but it is concerned that it will lose some of its best traders to other banks where personal trading is permitted. **********To eliminate such disparities in trading practices, Mr. von Rosen said, Germany needs new laws and \"a central authority.\" But he said he did not believe insider trading could be completely eliminated. \"Even with the best laws, you cannot completely protect people from being murdered in New York,\" Mr. von Rosen said. \"We have to make it possible that the investor gets the fairest treatment possible. The markets here must be extremely transparent. But it is not possible to control everything.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/22/business/bear-stearns-sues-proxy-firm-saying-deceit-was-used-to-obtain-secrets.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 808, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bear, Stearns Sues Proxy Firm, Saying Deceit Was Used to Obtain Secrets", "print_headline": "Bear, Stearns Sues Proxy Firm, Saying Deceit Was Used to Obtain Secrets", "body_text": " **********Bear, Stearns & Company filed suit yesterday against one of Wall Street's largest proxy solicitors, charging that employees of D. F. King & Company illegally obtained confidential information about the securities transactions of some of the brokerage's wealthiest clients. **********The suit says King employees used the confidential information in the company's proxy business and sold it to some clients. The information was said to include the names of Bear, Stearns clients and the number of shares they held in specific stocks and other securities. Such information could be useful to companies that want to find out who is accumulating their stock or who owns securities that would need to be tendered in a corporate reorganization. **********John Gavin, president of D. F. King, indicated yesterday that evidence had been found supporting the claim, but he said the questionable activities involved only a single employee. \"Based on counsel's preliminary review of the facts, the allegations, if true, appear to be limited to only one of King's employees,\" he said. \"Pending completion of the investigation, that employee has been suspended.\"  Market-Intelligence Unit **********Like other proxy solicitors on Wall Street, King runs a market-intelligence division, which is hired by corporations and others to determine why unusual trading activity is taking place in clients' stock. It is this division that conducted the activities detailed in the suit. **********The lawsuit describes a scheme that Bear, Stearns unraveled after becoming suspicious three years ago. The firm said that people working for King telephoned employees who worked in sensitive areas at the brokerage. The King employees identified themselves as senior executives or traders at Bear, Stearns, the brokerage contends, and demanded that the clerks tell them which accounts had bought particular stocks or bonds, and in what quantities. **********Proxy solicitors emerged as important powers on Wall Street in the last decade. As takeover battles moved from the board room to shareholders, proxy solicitors made the appeals to individuals, drafted the advertisements stating a company's case, and counted the ballots. **********As their roles grew, the proxy firms established market-intelligence units, which built on the proxy business to keep a steady flow of revenue coming from companies that wanted to know why investors were buying or selling large amounts of their securities.  Battle for Dominance **********King, one of two giant proxy solicitors on Wall Street, has for years been locked in a head-to-head battle with its chief competitor, Georgeson & Company. A third proxy solicitor, the Carter Organization, was rocked in a 1989 scandal that resulted in a guilty plea by its founder, Donald C. Carter, to charges of stealing $1 million from clients. **********Bear, Stearns executives expressed anger yesterday about the scheme that they charge D. F. King with committing. \"To say that we're upset about this is an understatement,\" Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of Bear, Stearns, said in an interview. \"What they have done, what we are aware of, is absolute lying and stealing.\" **********Mr. Greenberg said the New York City Police Department was alerted to the situation during the firm's internal investigation. A lawyer for Bear, Stearns said the firm had not yet consulted the Securities and Exchange Commission or the United States Attorney's office, but was examining that possibility.  First Suspected in 1988 **********If such a scheme did take place, the potential damage to market investors could be substantial. Mr. Greenberg said the firm first suspected leaks of confidential information in 1988, as some clients who had quietly accumulated large amounts of stock in a company were telephoned by executives of that company to find out their intentions. Also, holders of large amounts of bonds in confidential accounts were called during corporate restructurings by officials seeking their support. Mr. Greenberg refused to say if King was responsible for those leaks, citing a court-imposed seal on a related lawsuit. **********But Bear, Stearns is contending that it was damaged by the scheme it says occurred, as some clients stopped doing business with the firm after confidential information was leaked. \"There is no question that people did leave,\" Mr. Greenberg said. \"They were afraid there was leakage. It was horribly embarrassing.\" **********The firm investigated the leaks for years, believing that the information was stolen or that employees were bribed or tricked. After using lie detectors and other investigative efforts, Bear, Stearns executives concluded that employees were being tricked by someone outside the firm. **********Bear, Stearns said it obtained evidence of a link to King by tapping phones in sensitive areas and obtaining a court order for telephone company records. Those records showed that calls in which people claimed to be Bear, Stears executives were placed from King's offices. **********A related suit from Bear, Stearns was filed in the past against King, the complaint indicates. The allegations in that suit, however, were sealed. Bear, Stearns is now seeking to have the filings in that suit unsealed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/24/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-foote-cone-belding-wins-moussy-account.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foote, Cone & Belding Wins Moussy Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Foote, Cone & Belding Wins Moussy Account", "body_text": " **********Foote, Cone & Belding, Chicago, yesterday was awarded the advertising account for Moussy, a non-alcoholic brew imported from Switzerland by the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colo.

As one Administration official put it today: \"If Saddam accepts this Soviet proposal we have a real problem.\" **********Administration officials say the problem is rooted in the fact that the Soviet proposal, which has not been disclosed publicly, does not, on the surface, appear unreasonable. Without being specific about its provisions, Administration officials hint that it involves Soviet commitments to Iraq -- commitments that would not bind the United States or its coalition partners -- in return for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, which the United States is demanding. **********The main problem, officials say, is that President Bush has been committed to ending the Persian Gulf war with either a military defeat of Mr. Hussein or a political humiliation of him by forcing the Iraqi leader to withdraw from Kuwait without any \"reward.\" Anything short of either of those options, officials argue, could leave Mr. Hussein as a dangerous power in the region. **********Mr. Bush's objective, in other words, is not simply to get Iraq out of Kuwait, but to do so in a way that will insure that Mr. Hussein has nothing to show to his people and the Arab world for his Kuwait adventure -- except the destruction of his army and his country. Aides say Mr. Bush seems to believe that the Soviet initiative, if accepted in its present form by Iraq, might prevent such a clear-cut outcome. 'He Got Off the Hook' **********This is because the Soviet initiative, according to the vague descriptions being offered here, seems to involve Kremlin promises to try to address the Arab-Israel dispute after the gulf war, to secure Iraq's territorial integrity, to work for a lifting of sanctions on Iraq, to saving Mr. Hussein's regime and to oppose any retribution against Mr. Hussein. Those are concessions that the Iraqi leader has sought and might be able to present at home and in the Arab world as some sort of reward for leaving Kuwait. **********\"Even if it doesn't look like much today,\" an Administration official said, \"what will it look like six months from now when he is still around? People will say we rewarded aggression. People will say he got off the hook. They will ask what was this all about. They will say that after all the lines we drew in the sand we blinked.\" **********Because President Bush and his advisers are convinced that they could crush the Iraqi Army in Kuwait at a relatively low cost in allied lives, they say they are frustrated to have to deal with any solution that would involve neither a clear-cut military defeat of Iraq nor a clear-cut political defeat of President Hussein. 'Disastrous to Pause' **********As Representative John Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, told reporters after meeting today with President Bush: \"It would be disastrous to pause right now and let Saddam Hussein rehabilitate himself. He's either going to start withdrawing now or he's going to be forced to withdraw with some bloody battles. We're going to get him out of Kuwait. And I think Saddam Hussein will go, either from inside, internally, or militarily.\" **********But this raises a second problem. Administration officials know that if Iraq accepts the Soviet initiative, and the United States still goes ahead with a ground war, many Americans and many American allies in Europe and the Arab world who are not part of the anti-Baghdad military force would ask: how could the President risk so many lives to liberate Kuwait by force when he could have had a peaceful Iraqi withdrawal at the small price of Soviet promises that might not even bind the United States? **********Indeed, the German Government has already expressed support for the Soviet initiative. U.S.-Soviet Ties at Risk **********Even more serious would be what might happen to Soviet cooperation with the United States in the gulf, which has been the keystone of the entire international coalition. If Moscow has made what it believes to be a good faith offer involving, in its view, only relatively minor Soviet concessions to Baghdad, and the Iraqis accept it and Washington rejects it, that could mark the end of Soviet-American cooperation in this crisis, and afterward. **********\"We ought not to be dismissive of the Soviet effort,\" said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East. \"The Soviets are going to need our support after this war ends and we are going to need their acquiescence in the Middle East to do what we want. There is a lot at risk in United States-Soviet relations, in United States-Arab relations and in United States-Europe relations if we pass up a real opportunity to end this war.\" **********The third problem, from the Administration's point of view, is what happens if the Iraqis agree to most of the Soviet proposal but ask to simply negotiate a few points. **********\"How can we then launch our ground war?\" the Administration official asked. \"If they are perceived to be working toward peace, how can we put our other foot down?\" Exploiting a Delay **********Yet, said the official, any pause in the war would surely be exploited by the Iraqis to repair their runways or communications. **********What Mr. Bush did today when he said the Soviet proposal fell \"well short\" of American conditions was a pre-emptive strike, officials say. He hoped to both signal America's ongoing openness for diplomacy -- by not totally rejecting the Soviet initiative -- while signaling Moscow that if it wants its mediation effort to bear any fruit it is going to have to strip it of any components that would help Mr. Hussein survive politically. **********Mr. Bush's message has only highlighted the difference between the American and Soviet approaches to the gulf crisis. For the Kremlin the issue is Kuwait. For the United States the issue is Kuwait and the fate of the Iraqi Army and President Hussein. **********Those are also the issues for America's main allies in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel. **********The Saudis believe that a Saddam Hussein who survives this war would bide his time before coming after them. Israelis have told Washington that they would rather live with President Hussein without his army than Iraq's Army without Mr. Hussein -- although they would prefer to be rid of both. The Israeli view is that capabilities create intentions, and therefore as long as Iraq has such a large army it will eventually be a threat, even if Mr. Hussein is removed and is replaced by some colonel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/23/business/company-news-usair-sees-deficit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "USAir Sees Deficit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; USAir Sees Deficit", "body_text": " **********USAir Group Inc. said it expected to post a first-quarter operating loss even greater than the $168 million it lost in the final quarter of last year.

Who else is there?\" **********Along the nearly six-mile route, there was more sadness than grief as thousands watched, mostly in silence, while the gun carriage moved quickly through the streets surrounded by hundreds of men in white shirts, members of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, and jeeps loaded with soldiers. **********But Mr. Gandhi's assassination has left the mourning crowds uneasy about the violence that blights India, about the political future of the world's most populous democracy, even about Mr. Gandhi's legacy.  'Nothing Changes' **********\"People thought a new India would be born with Rajiv Gandhi,\" Rajesh Kumar, an engineer, said near India Gate, the high stone arch on the eastern end of Raj Path. \"It wasn't. He had too many cronies, corrupt people around him. He disappointed us. There are still two Indias, high-tech and poor, with people hungry. Nothing changes. This election, we hoped, it would change. We hoped he had changed.\" **********Nearby, an army officer, a man in his late 40's with a British accent, recalled that he knew Mr. Gandhi at the exclusive Doon School, a preparatory academy in Dehra Dun, in the foothills of the Himalayas. The officer, who declined to give his name, was a year ahead of Mr. Gandhi. **********\"He was well-behaved, very popular,\" the officer said. \"His grandfather, Pandit Nehru, would come visit, and it was very glamourous. Maybe Rajiv was a little out of depth at first in politics. He tried and sometimes failed. Nobody's perfect. The tragedy is we all sensed he had the possibility of being a true leader. Now he's gone.\" **********The flower-bedecked gun carriage and procession took three and a half hours to move through New Delhi and reach Shakti Sthal, a site beside the bleak Jamuna River where Mr. Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, and mother, Indira Gandhi, both Prime Ministers, were cremated. **********The procession stirred some emotion, especially at the conclusion as Mr. Gandhi's son, Rahul, a sophomore at Harvard University, clad in white kurta pajamas, lit the sandlewood funeral pyre amid the chanting of Hindu hymns. His sister, Priyanka, placed her arm around her mother, Sonia. Mrs. Gandhi wept. The entire congregation, including foreign dignitaries, stood silently for two minutes.  City Is Closed Down **********Earlier, as the funeral convoy reached downtown, several women were seen wailing. The terraces of high-rise buildings were jammed. Helicopters circled overhead. The city itself was closed down. **********Crowds of almost entirely young men, marching beside the funeral convoy, raised their fists and shouted in Hindi, \"The nation will remember the martyrdom of mother and son!\" and \"Long live Rajiv Gandhi!\" **********But the response to the procession along most of the route seemed surprisingly muted. **********\"We are left alone,\" Chinni Rao, a 42-year-old businessman, said as the procession moved toward India Gate, the massive war memorial. \"The grandfather is dead, the mother is dead, and now Rajiv. The Nehru family has served our country in my lifetime. They are gone. Perhaps the wife or children will keep the tradition alive.\" **********Nearby, Sunil Broota, a businessman, mopped his brow with his handkerchief. He had waited more than an hour in the sun to catch a glimpse of the funeral procession. 'Who Else Is There?' **********\"He was the only national leader we had,\" he said. \"'Who else is there? No one.\" **********As a loudspeaker repeated Hindu funeral chants, Mr. Broota said: \"This is not the end of the family. It's not the end of the dynasty. I don't believe that at all. It won't be. Someone will come from the family. Maybe not not this year. But sometime. Someone will come.\" **********The procession threaded past crowds that waited in a faintly carnival mood. Hawkers sold ices and chunks of coconut. Beggars sat on sidewalks. Water trucks pulled up, and crowds gathered to pass around a single glass and drink. There were families from villages in Rajasthan and elsewhere in northern India, but most of the throng seemed to be men from New Delhi who wanted to pay final tribute to the politician they called Rajiv. **********\"There's no strong person out there now,\" said Subodh Kapoor, a 30-year-old government worker, seated on the grass. \"The situation is so strange. Everything is uncertain. Stability seems in jeopardy. People are even a bit frightened.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/business/finance-briefs-114091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt * Dow Capital B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemical Canada, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a $500 million shelf offering. **********Common Stock * Cherokee Inc., Sunland, Calif., is making an initial public offering of 2.5 million common shares through Paine Webber Inc. * Immunomedics Inc., Warren, N.J., has filed for 2.5 million common shares through Allen & Co."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/15/world/7-soviet-republics-agree-to-seek-new-union.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1991-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "7 Soviet Republics Agree to Seek New Union", "print_headline": "7 Soviet Republics Agree to Seek New Union", "body_text": " **********President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the leaders of seven republics agreed today to work toward a new confederated \"Union of Sovereign States,\" with the central authorities exercising powers delegated by sovereign republics. **********There was no immediate indication exactly what powers would be delegated to the center, and participants said the agreement was still subject to approval by the parliaments of all the republics. **********The absence of several republics -- most notably the Ukraine, which is abstaining from any such discussions until after the republic holds a referendum on Dec. 1 on its future -- raised further questions about the prospects of the agreement. **********But all participants at the meeting, including President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, seemed heartened at least by the fact that agreement had been reached to pursue some form of political union. **********The very site of the meeting, a Government retreat in the suburb of Novo-Ogaryovo, was the one at which republic leaders first met in April to shape a new association. The agreement they reached then collapsed with the coup attempt in August, and officials said the new project was totally different from the federation envisioned then. **********The key difference is the wariness of most republic leaders of creating any central structures that could eventually reanimate the dictatorial center of the past. **********Speaking briefly to reporters after their eight-hour meeting, Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and leaders of Byelorussia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenistan indicated that more than half the discussion had been dedicated to the basic shape of the new association. **********Mr. Yeltsin said the participants finally had agreed that the future union should be a \"Union of Sovereign States -- Confederated State, fulfilling functions delegated by states participating in the agreement.\" **********The formula seemed to accept both Mr. Gorbachev's call for a state that could be a genuine subject of international law, and insistence of the republicans on a confederation in which they would determine and limit the powers of the central Government. A confederation is a league of independent states joined by negotiated bonds. **********Mr. Yeltsin said after the meeting that it was still difficult to say how many republics would join the union, but added, \"After today's discussions, I am firmly convinced there will be a union.\" **********Declining to take part in the meeting, besides the Ukraine, were Georgia and Moldavia. The Armenian leader is now in the United States and did not send a deputy, and the leader of Uzbekistan reportedly missed the session because of transportation problems. The three Baltic republics, their independence now internationally recognized, no longer take part in such discussions. 10 Signed Economic Pact **********The move toward a political association follows the signing of a draft economic pact by 10 republics to create a free-market zone in place of the former command economy. That agreement was intended to prevent the chaotic disintegration of complex economic ties among the republics, but a final agreement has not yet been reached. **********Leaders of the Ukraine at first balked, but finally also joined in the economic agreement. But the republic's Prime Minister, Vitold Fokin, today threatened to resign unless the Ukrainian Parliament lifted its resistance to ratifying the agreement. **********Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan, who has been among the strongest advocates of negotiating a new political union, said after today's meeting that the economic treaty \"was constantly balking in the absence of a political union.\" **********The heads of the republics gathered as the State Council, the collective federal executive formed after the August coup. They also named Ivan Silayev as the new national Prime Minister. The appointment formalized a function that Mr. Silayev, formerly Prime Minister of the Russian republic, had been filling as head of the interim Inter-State Economic Committee."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/business/the-media-business-abc-agrees-to-broadcast-cable-show.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1991-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 621, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ABC Agrees To Broadcast Cable Show", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; ABC Agrees To Broadcast Cable Show", "body_text": " **********ABC and the cable network Nick at Nite have agreed to run a new situation comedy on each network on separate nights. It is the first time that a program produced by a cable network will be carried by a broadcast network. **********ABC has bought the rights to the first six episodes of the series, a comedy called \"Hi, Honey, I'm Home,\" and will begin running them in July. ABC is expected to announce a date for the series today. **********Each episode of the show will run on ABC once during the week and will be rerun on Nick at Nite later the same week. **********The process, which Nick at Nite is calling an \"instant rerun,\" is a precursor of a new cooperation between broadcast and cable networks in an effort to share program costs and expand their audience reach, Geraldine B. Laybourne, the president of Nick at Nite, said yesterday. **********\"This is a sign of the kind of alliances we are going to see in the 90's,\" Ms. Laybourne said. **********The deal rose from a previous agreement between ABC and Nick at Nite's sister network, MTV, to develop a weekly series for the network. ABC did not pick up the first series pilot produced by MTV, but the cooperation between the companies led Nick at Nite to offer the comedy series to ABC. **********As soon as ABC executives saw the pilot episode for \"Hi, Honey, I'm Home,\" they wanted to put it on the broadcast network first, Ms. Laybourne said. **********Executives at ABC's programming department had the day off yesterday and could not be reached for comment. **********The series will have a special television angle as well. It deals with a television situation-comedy family from the 1950's whose series is put on hiatus by a network. It is a \"Donna Reed\"-type family, Ms. Laybourne said. **********While waiting to see if they can get back on the air, the television family members are \"relocated\" to a suburb next to a \"real\" family of the 90's, led by a single mother. The two families have a culture clash, which Ms. Laybourne said subtly and humorously pointed out the conflicts faced by women torn betwen careers and traditional concepts of motherhood. **********The show features a mostly new group of writers, producers and actors and will be taped at the Nick at Nite studios in Orlando, Fla.  'Vested Interest' **********Ms. Laybourne said Nick at Nite, which depends heavily on old network reruns for its regular programming fare, had a \"vested interest\" in the broadcast networks. \"I guess you could say if network TV is not so strong as it might be, we're threatened too,\" she said. **********Nick at Nite and ABC have also agreed to cross-promote the series on the two networks. Ms. Laybourne said clips from the first episode would also run on Nick at Nite's sister cable networks -- MTV, VH-1 and Comedy Central -- just before the first episode is broadcast on ABC. The four cable networks are owned by Viacom Inc. **********Nick at Nite will produce at least 13 episodes of the series. \"It's a great deal for ABC,\" Ms. Laybourne said. \"They didn't have to pay for a pilot out of their development budget.\" She would not disclose the program's costs. **********The broadcast networks have been looking for ways to offer more original programs during the summer months, when millions of viewers abandon network television during its regular diet of reruns. But escalating program costs have become a problem for the broadcast networks, even during the regular television season. The networks have increasingly looked to special or unusual program deals to get different shows on during the summer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/02/business/the-media-business-tough-times-for-movie-theaters.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1991-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tough Times for Movie Theaters", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Tough Times for Movie Theaters", "body_text": " **********For the first time that he can recall, Sumner M. Redstone, the owner of the National Amusements theater chain, has strong doubts about the movie theater business. **********Mr. Redstone has been a leader in building movie theaters across the country. But now he is retrenching. **********\"The industry is no longer recession resistant,\" Mr. Redstone said. \"All the dynamics make it worse.\" **********Mr. Redstone, who also owns Viacom Inc., a cable television and broadcasting company, pointed to the increasing competition from other forms of entertainment, including the growing number of pay-per-view movies on cable television. \"You really will have 10 or 15 channels of pay-per-view,\" he said. \"That business is growing at movie theaters' expense.\" **********In addition, Mr. Redstone said, \"good movies like 'Frankie and Johnnie' that used to do good business don't last as long. That's bothersome. **********\"This time, the recession counts.\"  Severe Problems **********While Mr. Redstone may be more outspoken in his concerns than other theater-chain executives, they also acknowledge that they have had a poor year. Whether they see the industry's problems as cyclical or part of a larger trend, they all agree that the problems are severe. **********Box-office receipts are down more than 4 percent so far this year. Receipts totaled $3.93 billion in late November, down from $4.12 billion at the comparable point last year, the trade paper Variety reported. **********While the Thanksgiving weekend has produced some hits -- including Paramount's \"The Addams Family,\" Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Columbia Pictures' \"My Girl\" -- Mr. Redstone for one is still pessimistic. **********\"Even though the individual pictures were extremely strong and therefore encouraging, I estimate the industry gross was off about 20 percent from the holiday period last year,\" he said Saturday. **********Moreover, two big movie theater companies, the Cineplex Odeon Corporation and AMC Entertainment Inc., have reported losses in one or more quarters this year. Both incurred debt from overexpansion, but their core business is weak as well. Counting on Christmas **********Carmike Cinemas Inc. and the theater divisions of the General Cinema Corporation and the United Artists Entertainment Company have been profitable. But Carmike's net income was basically flat for the first nine months of 1991, as were the earnings of the United Artists theater division. Moreover, United Artists' earnings a year earlier were depressed by a one-time write-down for a restructuring that included closing some theaters. And General Cinema's profits came only after an extensive restructuring, in which the company also closed some theaters. **********Theater operators are still counting heavily on Christmas films, particularly \"Hook,\" a highly promoted film that will open on Dec. 11. A. Alan Frieberg, the president of Loews Theaters, a unit of Columbia Pictures, said the mix of films this season looked like one of the best in years. The successful recent openings of several films have increased hopes among theater owners that audiences will flock to \"Hook,\" \"The Last Boy Scout\" and \"Prince of Tides.\" **********Some theater chain owners are optimistic. At Carmike, for example, its chairman, Michael W. Patrick, remains bullish, although he acknowledges that he is anticipating a flat year at best for his company. **********For years, the film business was considered recession proof on the theory that any economic difficulties would be offset by moviegoers' need to escape them.  Discounting at Cineplex **********\"But this time, the recession is taking a whack at us,\" said Allen Karp, president of Cineplex Odeon. His company has started discounting tickets to attract more moviegoers. **********Moreover, there are fewer films that last for weeks or even months. The longer a film plays, the better it is for theater operators, since they get a larger percentage of each box-office dollar. **********Mr. Redstone, for one, has become convinced that the theater business is no longer a growth business. Over the last decade Mr. Redstone's National Amusements Inc. built dozens of large theaters. It currently operates nearly 700 screens. But now, Mr. Redstone said, \"barring a miracle location, we won't build.\" **********Not everyone is so negative. Richard Simon, a movie industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, noted that although theater attendance was down in the second and third quarters, it was up in the first quarter, despite the Persian Gulf war. \"That tells you the business is product driven,\" he said, referring to the films that the theater chains show. Study of Carmike **********Still, after concluding a study of Carmike Cinemas, Mr. Simon did not recommend the stock. \"Carmike, like everybody else, is exposed to the overall dynamics of the box office,\" he concluded. **********Few new theaters are opening these days, in part because there are already so many theaters that operators are having difficulties getting exclusive rights to show a film in a particular area. **********Of course, not all movie chains are retrenching completely. Mr. Patrick of Carmike gets high marks from competitors for expanding into smaller cities like Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Bozeman, Mont. But in these cities, there is little competition from other theater chains. **********Loews, meanwhile, has added a handful of theaters, particularly in the New York market. Mr. Frieberg said its two new multiplex theaters in Manhattan were doing well. **********Other chains, however, are not so willing to bet on the future. AMC Entertainment, for instance, began selling some theaters last year after expanding aggressively in the 1980's. **********And AMC has been cutting ticket prices, particularly for its matinee and 5:30 P.M. shows. \"Attendance over the summer and the fall has been very, very bad,\" said Jack Holland, vice president for marketing at AMC. \"We don't believe it is the end of the world, but this is a particularly bad cycle.\" **********Some analysts are critical of the price cuts by AMC. Still, Mr. Holland argues that one way to stop the downward trend in moviegoing is, once again, to cut ticket costs. **********That, of course, does not bode well for earnings. And if the strategy smacks of fear, it is not surprising, given the malaise that is evident in the industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/11/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-grey-advertising-picked-by-raytheon.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grey Advertising Picked by Raytheon", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Grey Advertising Picked by Raytheon", "body_text": " **********Moving to consolidate advertising for accounts that had been handled by a dozen agencies, the Raytheon Company, Lexington, Mass., yesterday named Grey Advertising, New York, as its agency of record. **********The announcement followed a three-month review that began with 20 agencies and ended with Grey facing one other finalist: Della Femina, McNamee Inc., New York.

C. Penney were essentially flat. Even K Mart's discount stores, which generally turned in robust sales during the recession, showed a decline last month. **********But Wal-Mart and the Gap continued to stand out against the industry's lackluster results. Sales rose by 32 percent at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, and by 41 percent at the Gap. Consumers Remain Cautious **********Mostly, however, the September sales results indicate that consumers are extremely wary, retailers and analysts said yesterday, as they are faced with gloomy employment figures and high consumer debt. **********\"Despite what economists have said about the economy being in a slow recovery, nobody has told the consumer yet,\" said Jeffrey B. Edelman of C. J. Lawrence Inc. **********Until September, the white-collar nature of the recession had taken a greater toll on department stores and more expensive retailers. \"This month, everybody had a disappointment,\" said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company.  Broad Sales Decline **********The weakness was widespread, cutting across all categories of retailing. The Merrill Lynch index of 22 leading retailers showed that September sales were up by only 1 percent over the period last year. The index compares sales of stores that have been open at least a year, or same-store sales, which analysts view as the best barometer of performance. **********Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company, called sales for the month \"disappointing and below expectation.\" **********The weak results were particularly troubling because retailers' results were being compared with September of last year, which was one of the worst retailing months in 1990, because of the drop in consumer spending after the invasion of Kuwait last August. **********\"It's clear that consumer spending has been a lot weaker than anyone expected,\" said Mr. Barry of Kidder, Peabody. \"Virtually all the major retailers were below plan, and they were planning conservatively.\" **********At Sears, Roebuck & Company, the sales at its merchandise group fell by 1 percent for the month, to $3.07 billion. The Chicago-based retailer's same-store sales for the month were off by nine-tenths of a percent. Dollar figures for same-store sales were unavailable for any of the retailers. **********J. C. Penney & Company, which is based in Dallas, reported that its overall sales were up by four-tenths of a percent, to $1.31 billion, while those at its same stores were down, also by four-tenths of a percent. **********At the Gap Inc., its same-store sales were up strongly, by 20 percent, compared with an overall sales gain of 41 percent, to $255 million. The company, based in San Francisco, offers a frequently changing line of casual clothes in attractive stores. **********\"Denim is the hottest thing out there in Retail-land,\" said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at the First Manhattan Company.  Wal-Mart Keeps Ahead **********Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Ark., also continued to outpace its competitors. Its overall sales gain of 32 percent, to $3.26 billion, included the results of the McLane Company, a retailer acquired last year. Excluding McLane's results, Wal-Mart's September sales were up by 24 percent. **********Sales at Wal-Mart's same stores rose by 7 percent. **********There were signs, however, that the sluggish sales climate has begun to filter down to discounters, which have been one of retailing's bright spots this year. **********Sales at the K Mart Corporation's stores were down slightly last month. The company, based in Troy, Mich., does not publicly release separate sales information for its stores, but it confirmed that it had told analysts of the sales decline at its discount stores. The retailer attributed the drop to the prolonged warmer weather, which can hurt fall apparel sales, as well as the weak economy, which dampened spending on big-ticket items. **********While sales at K Mart's discount-store operation were down slightly for the month, the company said its September sales increased by 5.3 percent over all, to $2.97 billion. Those at its same stores rose by 1.4 percent.  One Bright Spot **********But despite yesterday's gloomy results, several large retailers told analysts that their sales for the first week of October were robust. **********Last month, retailers were forced to cut prices to lure consumers into stores. \"Frankly, too much of our business is being done on promotion or some kind of value price situation,\" said Stephen E. Watson, the president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in Minneapolis. **********But in contrast to markdowns taken last year to move surplus inventory, analysts said that this year retailers ordered more cautiously and they were using markdowns to draw in consumers and increase market share. **********\"Retailers are acting in a much more prepared fashion,\" said Mr. Tashjian of First Manhattan. **********Still, Mr. Feiner of Merrill Lynch said that September's weak sales were likely to make retailers even more cautious about inventory levels for the rest of the year, especially as the holiday season approached. **********\"We expect to see some cutbacks, in terms of merchandise commitments for Christmas,\" he said. Such a move by retailers could ripple through the economy, hurting clothing manufacturers, he said.  Dayton Hudson Up 9.1% **********At Dayton Hudson, its overall sales were up 9.1 percent last month, to $1.34 billion, with those at its same stores gaining 5.1 percent. Sales at its Target discount unit rose by 12 percent, with those at Target stores open for more than a year increasing by 7 percent. **********The May Department Stores Company, based in St. Louis, said its overall sales rose by 8.3 percent, to $973 million, while its same-store sales rose slightly, by four-tenths of a percent. **********The Limited Inc., with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, said its September sales increased by 16 percent over all, to $532.5 million, while those at its same stores grew by 4 percent. **********The New York-based Woolworth Corporation said its total sales dropped by 1.9 percent, to $874 million, in September. But the retailer's stores in the United States experienced a 4.1 percent sales gain, to $496 million, while those at its same stores fell slightly. **********The Melville Corporation, based in Harrison, N.Y., whose stores sell footwear, apparel and other products, said its overall sales rose by 7.2 percent last month, to $892.8 million, while its same-store sales fell by five-tenths of a percent. **********The TJX Companies, a discount retailer of specialty clothing with headquarters in Framingham, Mass., reported an 11.6 percent rise in its sales over all, to $265.8 million.

To measure such jarring events, the International Paper Company is using a new sensor that fits inside a package and records the level of shock, vibration, temperature and humidity the parcel encounters in transit. **********The company uses the data to help determine the effectiveness of the packaging materials it designs and to develop packages that provide protection at the least cost. **********Based on information provided by the sensor, International Paper has decided that some of its packaging offers more protection than is needed, and it has already redesigned some cartons to use less material, thereby saving money. **********The sensor is manufactured by Instrumented Sensor Technology Inc. of Lansing, Mich. The company began selling the sensor a year ago and now has about 100 customers, ranging from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to railroad companies, computer makers and packaging companies. **********The Instrumented Sensor device is housed in a metal box that is about four inches wide and two inches high and that weighs about two and a half pounds. **********While paper companies and shippers have previously used machines to assess the forces that buffet packages in transit, the earlier gadgets were used in laboratory-like settings. The new sensors are significantly smaller and quicker, and they can actually go inside a package or machine and provide data collected while goods were in transit. **********International Paper began using the new sensor last November to collect information for an important shipping customer. Four other shippers are also eager to use it, International Paper says. **********The company typically deploys a pair of the sensors when measuring the stress a package undergoes as it is being transported by truck. One sensor is placed inside a package and another is placed on the floor of the delivery truck. **********The sensor inside the container is mainly used to measure sudden shock and to determine drop heights, registering whether a package falls to the floor from where it is stacked and the distance of the drop. The sensor on the floor measures the vibration caused by the variations in acceleration of the truck. In addition, the sensors can measure humidity and temperature. **********\"In the past, we have used package performance testing equipment in the laboratory to simulate what a package is exposed to in transit,\" said Stephen Beshore, program manager at International Paper's package innovation center. \"But this device gives us a much more accurate reading of what a package goes through.\" **********He added, \"By placing a sensor in the container being transported, we can tell when a truck hits potholes. We can tell when the truck comes to a cloverleaf on the highway and measure the sideways acceleration. It gives a precise reading of what goes on during the transportation of an item.\" **********The information is recorded and stored in a microprocessor-based digital data system inside the sensor for several weeks and later is transferred to computers for processing and analysis. The company then generates statistical summaries and graphic displays of the material. **********\"The equipment allows us to measure what each box is required to do,\" Mr. Beshore said. \"We test it and then design a package that tells us everything the package has to withstand: whether it will be dropped, whether it is crushed while being loaded, whether the moisture in the air affects the contents. And we're now designing packages that do what the customer needs.\" **********Typically, the company would collect data from a number of shipments in analyzing its packaging. Mr. Behore said International Paper discovered through the use of the sensors that \"our packaging is overdesigned in that it is stronger than it needed to be.\" **********In response, International Paper has modified some of its designs. For example, the company made containers that were 12 one-thousandths of an inch thick to transport cigarettes. After testing with the sensor, the thickness of the boxes was reduced to 10 one-thousandths of an inch. \"That's not insignificant when you're talking about the volume of containers we produce,\" Mr. Beshore said. **********Products that monitor the level of vibration and shock to shipments are not new. But most of the earlier technology was quite bulky, perhaps between 10 to 20 times the size and weight of the Instrumented Sensor device. **********The previous technology generally used an instrumentation device that recorded signals onto a tape. With that technology, everything was recorded, even if a truck was sitting on the side of the road, and thus much of the information recorded was superfluous. **********Using the technology pioneered by Instrumented Sensor, the recording device can be set up so that data are taken only if they exceed a predetermined level, much as a sound sets off a voice-activated cassette tape recorder. **********The Instrumented Sensor equipment is also notable for its compactness, which enables full analysis to be accomplished in a self-contained package. Once the data have been removed from the sensor, Mr. Beshore said, \"Within a matter of several minutes to an hour, the computer will crunch the information and the customer will immediately have tables and charts.\" **********The newer equipment is cheaper as well. Customers say the older recorders and associated equipment were twice as expensive as the Instrumented Sensor equipment, which costs $7,000 to $8,000 a unit. **********While International Paper uses the sensors to design packaging to transport boxes of everything from food to cigarettes to antifreeze, there are uses for the sensors beyond the packaging industry. They are now being used to record data during the transportation of components -- particularly rocket boosters -- used on the space shuttle. **********\"It's a useful monitoring device for extremely high value cargo,\" said Gregory D. Hoshal, president of Instrumented Sensor and creator of the monitoring units. \"In the case of components for the space shuttle, it is important because it can provide detailed data on anything that goes wrong in the transportation process.\" **********Mr. Hoshal estimated that over all the market for acceleration-based measuring devices could reach $80 million to $100 million a year. **********He said companies that make industrial products were prime candidates to employ the sensors to measure the stresses the work environment places on their products. \"It's useful for companies that design computers because the computer is exposed to such environmental hazards as shock and vibration,\" he said. **********Mr. Hoshal added that there were a number of customers using the sensor to design the next generation of products by assessing conditions the products must endure in their end use. **********\"Some companies are using the sensor to determine the impact on their products of such things as the continuous slamming of drawers on a desk where a sensitive piece of computer equipment is used,\" Mr. Hoshal said. \"That way, they know what they need in the next wave of that equipment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/business/world-markets-caution-in-the-coup-s-aftermath.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1991-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets; Caution in the Coup's Aftermath", "print_headline": "World Markets; Caution in the Coup's Aftermath", "body_text": " **********It is not quite the same as the Berlin Wall coming down. But the collapse of the hard-line coup in the Soviet Union last week is expected to send a new surge of confidence though Europe, giving some lift to the stock markets in the countries that will play a role in economic development of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. **********\"It is the definitive death of Communism. The political risk of Communism has diminished, and that changes the whole outlook for Europe,\" said David Roche, international strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company in London. **********Mr. Roche, who interrupted his vacation because of the coup, is now heading for the Soviet Union. But before he left London, he added to his portfolio to reflect the week's events, buying stocks like Mannesmann in Germany. **********The return of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the political victory won by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and the humiliating defeat of the old-line Communists mean two things for the equity markets: The general risk factor added on for turmoil in the Soviet Union, especially in markets in Germany and Austria, is lower. Many stocks now will not look as expensive as they might have. And the outlook for capital gains from the development of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is a little better again -- and a bit better balanced. **********Market analysts don't expect a headlong rush of often unthinking buying that the market experienced after the Berlin Wall cracked in October 1989. In the sober reassessment since then, investors have learned how long and how risky the wait for those gains might be. **********And analysts are quick to point out that the victory is a fragile one. The Soviet economy is in a shambles. If the economic reform does not bear some fruit quickly or if Mr. Gorbachev does not move fast enough, the mood and politics in the country could deteriorate rapidly. **********But in the post-coup Soviet Union, with Boris Yeltsin playing a larger, if not equal political role, Mr. Gorbachev will have to move toward real economic development rather than try some faulty hybrid as before. Because of this change, analysts say, investments in the Soviet Union and investments in the companies that invest in the Soviet Union will all look more attractive. **********Mr. Roche's bullishness isn't entirely new. In the case of Germany, he is talking his own book a little. He was increasing his investments in Germany earlier this year when many other brokers and fund managers were staying away and telling others to do so. **********Still, there's no denying the sudden new allure. \"I am sufficiently confident, and this brings us to a more bullish stance,\" Mr. Roche said. **********A flow of capital toward Europe because of the dramatic events in the Soviet Union could also affect investment outlooks in the United States, some analysts believe. For one thing, it could take away some support from the stock markets. It could also weaken the dollar some in the near term. **********\"How much more potential is there in the U.S. market now compared to Europe over the next couple of months?\" asked Jeffrey Loper of A.G. Edwards. His answer: None. **********Other analysts also are noting that despite the euphoria following the failed coup, many of the same tired problems that financial markets faced before are still there. And these should not be forgotten. **********One is that some markets are still expensive, including the United States and Germany. On the day of the coup, following a burst of panic selling that sent markets sharply down, analysts said that many markets looked better priced as a result of the declines. With the run-up in prices after the Soviet troops withdrew from Moscow and the coup leaders fled, that price advantage has all but evaporated. **********By week's end, most of the major markets around the world had regained most or all of their lost ground. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,040.25, up 72.23 points since the coup. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,640.7, a new record high and up 19.7 points since the coup. France's CAC-40 closed at 1,833.45, 13.14 points over the pre-coup level. Germany's DAX 30 index, which was hit the hardest, closed at 1,627.24, just 26.09 points below last Friday's level. Only in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 fell 450.43 Friday, did the index end far below (749 points) the pre-coup level. **********Second, despite the Soviet events, the risk of higher interest rates in Germany has not gone away. The Bundesbank rate rise on August 15 clearly left room for ratcheting German rates up another notch. **********Also, Japan is still in trouble. Granted, the Nikkei looks less expensive at its present levels, which are not too far above the lows hit during the Persian Gulf crisis. But the country's stock and bank scandals have undermined investor confidence. Tokyo analysts continue to speculate that the scandals could widen and that eventually Japan's Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, might have to resign. **********Finally, the failed coup did nothing to alleviate the global shortage of capital. And if the West now begins to put more money into the Soviet Union, which appears to be a necessary element for success in the post-coup environment, it will only add to the strain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/world/after-the-war-plo-refuses-order-to-disarm-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.L.O.

But critics say that would transform the economy and society into a far more concentrated structure, dominated by big corporations. **********Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an investment advisory firm, regards this proposal as \"very dangerous.\" In an interview, he said it would confer too much power on a corporate and financial elite, with close ties to the Government, transforming the United States from an economic democracy to a \"corporate state.\" **********Other critics of the plan say the \"too big to fail\" doctrine, which would be retained, would increase the concentration of financial power by throwing the weight of Government behind big banks and would contradict the Administration's professed support of market-determined solutions. **********Robert Glauber, Treasury Under Secretary and former Harvard professor, who had most to do with the drafting of the plan, rejects charges that it would favor the big over the small. He said in an interview that there would not be a big push by industrial corporations into banking. Few, he said, are so flush with cash that they would want to put billions into bank investments and acquisitions. And relatively few banks would look attractive now, given the competition from other financial service companies and \"non-bank banks,\" their low and often overstated profits, low stock values, large numbers of nonperforming loans, and the necessity of being subjected to Government regulation. One almost wonders why the Administration even wants to propose acquisition of banks by industrial companies. **********On both the adequacy of capital and \"too big to fail\" issues, Mr. Glauber said the Administration's aim was to reduce failures by big and small banks alike and to improve banks' profitability by widening their opportunities to compete in other lines of business and across state borders. **********But \"despite the Administration's market orientation,\" he said, it would have to act to prevent failures of big banks that would threaten the economic system. Central banks in all countries act to prevent \"systemic risk.\" The issue is always which banks to save, and here the Administration provides for joint decision-making between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. \"Secretary Brady doesn't believe bigger is better,\" Mr. Glauber said. \"He believes in strong community and regional banks, and our plan will help regional banks to grow and expand across state borders.\" Yet many smaller banks fear that the plan would open their territory to big money-center banks, and they will fight it in Congress. **********Should the Glass-Steagall Act be repealed, as the Administration proposes, and commercial banks allowed to do investment banking and sell insurance? Albert Gailord Hart, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University, a noted banking scholar, told his seminar this week: \"The idea that banks can be put in good shape by letting them horn in on the overcrowded businesses of investment banking and insurance is crazy. Whenever banks go into a new line where experience as commercial bankers is not the key to success, they come a cropper.\" **********As evidence, he cited \"the Florida real estate disaster when banks went into real estate investment trusts,\" the losses (including the failure at Continental Illinois) when banks engaged in syndication of loans based on oil and related real estate in the Southwest, the evaporation (which still plagues us) of \"sovereign loans\" in the third world. \"The further mess created by the banks' involvement in corporate takeovers in the 1980's,\" he said, \"is just beginning to become clear to outsiders, but will prove at least as expensive as those just mentioned.\" **********Like Professor Hart, Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, fears that diversification by banks into other businesses will weaken their ability to perform their \"remarkable function as instruments of monetary policy.\" She stressed the danger of banks being driven further into riskier credit markets, creating pressures on the Federal Reserve to \"overliquefy -- and ultimately create more inflation.\" **********In Congress this year, the banking issue will be the most urgent after the war in the Persian Gulf, and it is an issue even more crucial to the nation's economic strength."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/business/banc-one-won-t-make-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banc One Won't Make Bid", "print_headline": "Banc One Won't Make Bid", "body_text": " **********The Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, said yesterday that it would not, as had been expected, bid for the banks of the failed Bank of New England Corporation.

Gorbachev on Sunday, voting overwhelmingly for independence in the two republics. **********With most of the ballots in the advisory plebiscites counted, officials said independence was favored by 77 percent in Latvia and by a similar percentage in Estonia. **********The balloting, similar to a referendum last month in which Lithuanians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence, drew large numbers of voters in both republics. Many of the voters described the plesbiscites as another fateful step in the Baltics' year-old struggle to reverse the Kremlin's forced annexation of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in 1940. **********\"We are moved to tears this day,\" said Emily Grefcova, a gray-haired Latvian emerging from a voting booth.

Nationalist leaders say the voters' resolve grew after Soviet leaders endorsed an army tank raid on Jan. 13 that killed 16 Lithuanian demonstrators in Vilnius. **********Further challenges loom over Mr. Gorbachev's latest strategy for containing the 15 Soviet republics' campaign for self-rule: a national referendum on maintaining the current union, scheduled for March 17. **********The three Baltic republics, plus Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, have said they will not participate, Other republics are adding their own sovereignty-oriented questions to the ballot to challenge the Kremlin's authority. Dilemma for Russian Minority **********Apart from the spirit of local nationalism that seemed to prevail in today's plebiscites, there was a mixed sense of resentment and conflict among the republics' sizable minorities of non-Latvians and non-Estonians. These mainly Russian-born voters and their offspring feel caught between the demands of the republics' rising nationalism and the patriotism invoked by the Gorbachev Government in its anxious defense of the shaky Soviet empire. **********\"I have lived here 30 years, my best years,\" said Rudolf Chaika, a Russian who was first posted here from Moscow as a soldier in the Soviet Government's huge system for guarding the Baltics. He changed careers and chose to stay, raising a family that has come to think of Latvia as home. **********\"But this campaign has made me feel like an alien, an occupier, half-man, half-citizen,\" he said, nearly trembling as he referred to local proposals for citizenship restrictions that would favor indigenous Latvians. **********The republic's new, democracy-minded Parliament is expected to approve a moderate measure offering Latvian citizenship as a free choice. But in the campaign for the plebiscite, the Communist Party has warned the Russian minority that it faces a future of second-class rights and legal bias. **********Mr. Chaika said the issue was posed too simplistically on the ballot query: \"Are you for a democratic, independent state of Latvia?\" A similar question was on the Estonian ballot. **********\"Can I vote 'no' to democracy? If I say 'yes,' how can I know what sort of democracy will follow? I do not like what I see so far,\" he said. **********Ethnic Latvians account for 52 percent of this republic of 2.6 million people.

But it appeared to have been an important one. **********For Vitro -- which seized more than a quarter of the United States glass container market with its acquisition of the Anchor Glass Container Corporation in 1989 for about $900 million, including $460 million in debt -- the alliance is a powerful shield against the new competition that free trade is expected to unleash in Mexico's glass and housewares industries. **********The joint venture follows a familiar pattern at Corning, which has moved into areas like optical fibers and television glass through deals with conglomerates from Germany to Japan. But by its timing, analysts said Corning's accord with Vitro could hardly be more propitious. **********After years of failed efforts by the company to force products like its Corning Ware and Pyrex through protectionist barriers along the Rio Grande, Corning gets with this deal a strong foothold in Mexico when consumer buying power is on the rise and tariffs are on the wane. **********Perhaps most important, analysts say, the two companies will merge product lines that have been struggling to grow in recent years but appear quite complementary. To the Corning Ware and Visions cookware, Pyrex bakeware, Revere Ware and Corelle dinnerware of its American partner, Vitro will add its Crisa glassware and stemware, Termocrisa and Fortecrisa dinnerware and Cien and Kristaluxus crystal ware. **********\"The consumer-products division has unquestionably been Corning's sore spot over the last couple of years,\" said Jonathan Goldfarb, who follows the conglomerate for Merrill Lynch Research. \"There is a reasonable chance that with this combination, the new company is going to make strategic sense.\" **********Corning stock rose $1.50 yesterday, to $65.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Officials of the two companies said their distribution networks for housewares would probably be only the first thing they would share. **********Down the road, a Vitro official suggested, the two companies might get together to sell products like Corning's fiber optics technologies to Mexicans, who are abused by what they are certain is some of the worst telephone service in the world. A Corning official, on the other hand, said he thought the fiber-optics division would be able to market its products in Mexico without any help. **********Amid the increasing number of Mexican-American joint ventures that have taken place since Mexico began knocking down trade and investment barriers in 1988, the letter of agreement signed yesterday formalizes at least one of the largest. But more than its scale, the accord is distinguished by its balance. **********The deal differs from the one last month that joined the two countries' biggest retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Cifra, S.A., in a plan to open warehouse-style stores in Mexico. **********\"What distinguishes this joint venture from the others is that it goes both ways and encompasses true globalization,\" Julio Escamez, the president of Vitro-Crisa, the group's glassware division, said from the company headquarters in Monterrey, Mexico. \"We both needed to broaden our product lines.\" **********Corning's chairman, James R. Houghton, said in a telephone interview that he expected the deal to be completed by the end of the year. He and Richard Dulude, Corning's vice chairman for consumer products, recalled that the company had sought a way into Mexico for years. Until two years ago, they were daunted by Mexican tariffs on housewares of 100 percent. But the continued drop of tariffs now at 20 percent is just part of the attraction, Mr. Dulude said. **********\"Whether the Mexican market opens or not, the standard of living is going to increase and the consumer housewares business is going to increase as well,\" he said. \"Someone is going to take advantage of that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/world/beijing-marks-40-years-of-tibet-s-liberation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 680, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beijing Marks 40 Years of Tibet's 'Liberation'", "print_headline": "Beijing Marks 40 Years of Tibet's 'Liberation'", "body_text": " **********Somewhere in the far west of China, nestled in the Himalayas, is a Shangri-La brimming with contentment and human rights -- or so say the Chinese newspapers these days. **********It is Tibet, although it does not entirely resemble the Tibet that Western visitors describe.

While diplomats and scholars are often skeptical of some of the assertions and criticisms made by the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, his photo is everywhere in Tibet and there is little doubt that he is still revered and supported by virtually all Tibetans. **********The nature of the celebrations on Wednesday has not been revealed, perhaps for security reasons. Separatist demonstrations, often led by Buddhist monks and nuns, have occurred regularly in Tibet for four years, and martial law was lifted in Lhasa only last May. Martial law was imposed in March 1989, after clashes that left at least 16 people dead. **********\"They must be taking a lot of precautions\" to insure that there will be no unrest, said an Asian diplomat in Beijing.

Tibetan exiles say that the agreement, which concedes that Tibet is part of China, was achieved by threats and coercion. In any case, they say, Beijing has not abided by the promises in the agreement. **********The topics of a seminar in Beijing on the 40th anniversary suggest the way that the commemorative activities are unfolding.

Sales rose to $486.9 million, from $310.9 million. Per-share figures reflect a 4 percent increase in shares outstanding, to 126.3 million. **********Microsoft's continued growth reflects both the company's flow of new products and its dominance of parts of the software market -- for instance, the operating systems that personal computers require to run applications programs, like word processing or spreadsheets. Four Applications for Sale **********Microsoft benefits both from sales of Windows 3.0, a program that gives the MS-DOS operating system much of the ease of use of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, and from application programs to use with Windows. It has four Windows applications for sale when many competitors have yet to release any. Demand for the company's applications software, like the Excel spreadsheet, continued to grow, said Mike Hallman, Microsoft's president and chief operating officer. **********Microsoft announced its results today after the close of stock trading, but they were within the range of most analysts' estimates.

Now. **********His mother chides him for interrupting her story, then laughs and hands over the fruit. **********\"You were too young to remember, Gregor,\" said Annette Stephan, 33, sitting in her living room in Joachimsthal, a village 40 miles northeast of Berlin. **********\"That day was special,\" she said, recalling the family's first stroll into the west, when they were met and accompanied by this reporter. \"We were so happy just to be there. None of us had any idea what was ahead. Democracy, elections, getting the deutsche mark, unity, so much has changed since then.\" Bananas No Longer a Luxury **********Like all eastern Germans, the Stephan family is still coming to grips with the changes that culminated in German unification on Oct. 3, 1990. The differences are at once monumental and mundane. Capitalism has replaced Communism, and bananas are an everyday snack for Gregor, rather than a luxury item rarely found in East German food stores. **********The changes have also brought a pervasive sense of ambiguity to eastern Germany one year after unity, a mood shared by Mrs. Stephan, her husband and her parents. They are optimistic about the chances for economic recovery in the depressed region, but deeply concerned over the high level of unemployment and rising incidence of neo-Nazi violence toward foreigners that they see as an outgrowth of joblessness. **********While benefiting from extensive Government investment in their area's infrastructure, the Stephans and many other eastern Germans also tend to see their western countrymen as arrogant know-it-alls. And they are bewildered by the western German legal system, which has put on trial four former East German border guards accused of killing a young man who tried to flee in 1989. Police Partly Blamed **********\"I don't undertand how they can try those boys, but let the political leaders and military commanders who gave the shoot-to-kill orders go free,\" said Hans Schmalfeld, Mrs. Stephan's father. With his wife Wally, 55, he owns and operates an ice cream parlor in Joachimsthal, a town of 3,000 at the northern tip of the Werbellinsee, a large, picturesque lake in the Schorfheide forest. They went into business in 1978, one of a handful of private enterprises tolerated by the Communist authorities. **********They spend their days expanding and improving their business. In the evenings, they watch television and worry about what they see. Mr. Schmalfeld said the eastern German police are partly to blame for the recent attacks on foreigners in Hoyerswerda, a coal mining town near the border with Czechoslovakia. **********\"I saw those attacks on television and I thought, 'Oh dear God, not again,' \" said Mr. Schmalfeld, 53. \"This is how the Nazis gained power in the 1930's, and that is what started all our troubles here. I think we take these attacks more seriously than the western Germans because we've had lots of experience with dictatorship. It makes us afraid.\" **********Mr. Schmalfeld blamed the police for allowing the violence. \"The fact is that they would rather look on and do nothing than make a mistake that might cost them their jobs,\" he said. \"Most of the foreigners came here to do jobs that no one else wanted. Now that jobs are scarce, some people are looking for scapegoats.\" **********The Schmalfelds' jobs are relatively secure, since they have their own business. But Joachimsthal's industries, a woodworking and a garden-tool factory, have closed and unemployment has risen to between 60 and 70 percent, local officials said. **********Tourism was the other big source of income in the town. When East Germans could not travel to the West, 12,000 part-time residents and 30,000 tourists came each summer. But the number of tourists has dwindled. **********There are positive changes in Joachimsthal. A storm sewer system is being built, streets are being repaved, public buildings and private homes and businesses are being refurbished. In an effort to cash in on the construction boom, Annette Stephan and her husband, Joachim, 34, opened their own construction company on July 1. Mrs. Stephan runs the company and is the offical owner. **********\"Since we started this construction company, we're working harder than ever before,\" said Joachim Stephan, a trained brickmason. \"It's been six days a week from dawn to dark. But things are going good for us.\" **********The family financed their initial investment of $30,000 with a low-cost, Government-backed bank loan. For the first year, Mrs. Stephan hopes for turnover of $210,000. In the first three months of the company's existence, they have taken in $84,300. **********She pays her husband $1,084.34 a month. He had been making $783.13 a month working for a formerly state-owned construction company. Mrs. Stephan has not yet decided what she will pay herself. **********\"It depends on whether we make a profit,\" she said. **********It is a measure of how rapidly things have changed, she said, that Communism, division, the Berlin wall opening and unity are only memories now. **********\"From this vantage point,\" she said, \"one can't comprehend how they could do all that to us, locking us up, stultifying our minds, wasting so many lives. It seems so pointless and so long ago.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/world/after-the-war-americans-aiding-kurds-see-a-major-change-in-direction.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1991-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 555, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Americans Aiding Kurds See A 'Major Change in Direction'", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Americans Aiding Kurds See A 'Major Change in Direction'", "body_text": " **********American military officers, diplomats and aid workers in this eastern Turkish city, a staging area for relief, were taken by surprise by President Bush's speech Tuesday night announcing plans to establish camps for the Kurds. **********\"It was sort of like the start of the war -- somebody called up and said 'Turn on C.N.N.' \" said a United States Embassy official working with the operation here, a base for helicopter relief about 100 miles from the point where the Turkish and Iraqi borders intersect. \"We don't know anything at this end yet.\" **********Comdr.

But the work has proceeded more slowly than planned and with adjustments to a softer commercial real estate market. **********Two office buildings have just been completed and construction on a third is about to begin at the tract, which is called the Overpeck Centre. The three buildings will have a total of 658,000 square feet. The developer of the corporate park is Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, N.J., the pet food company. **********Two other office buildings, with a total of 288,000 square feet, and a 10-screen movie theater had been completed earlier. Hartz began the project in 1981 after agreeing to lease the property from the village for 99 years and give it a share in the proceeds. The site, once mostly a public landfill, overlooks the 810-acre Overpeck County Park and is about six miles from Manhattan. **********Construction is also expected to begin this spring on the project's retail operations, which will have up to 20,000 square feet, said Martin P. Gold, Hartz's director of marketing and planning. Rents for the shops have not yet been set. Plans for a 200-room hotel are waiting for the market to improve, he said, adding that the pace of future construction would also be tied to the market. **********When completed, the total value of the project, the first large-scale development in the village in 50 years, is expected to be $150 million. Like other projects across the state, Overpeck has shifted from speculative to buid-to-suit development. Hartz has struck two such deals. **********One is the 300,000-square-foot structure that Hartz recently completed for the UJB/Financial Corporation, a financial services organization that is consolidating its back-office operations, now at five locations. The company expects to have more than 800 employees in the building by the end of the year. **********Under the second deal, Hartz is leasing 4.5 acres to Samsung America Inc., which will build its corporate headquarters there. The company will relocate from Fort Lee, N.J., to the 150,000-square-foot building when it is completed next spring. **********A third building, with 208,000 square feet, had been started on speculation. In January, Mellon Securities Transfer Services moved 355 employees into 98,000 square feet of the recently completed structure. It relocated from 75,000 square feet in Fort Lee. **********The rest of the space in the new building is vacant. Asking rents are $21 to $22 a square foot, on a par with rents in comparable buildings in the northern New Jersey office market, said Robert Rudin, executive director of Edward S. Gordon New Jersey, a commercial brokerage in Saddle Brook. **********Mr. Rudin said concessions, like six-months' free rent, were still common in New Jersey and would remain so until the surfeit of space built during the construction frenzy of the mid-80's was absorbed. There is an 18-month supply of class A space -- which consists of newer buildings in better locations -- and a five-year supply of class B space, he said. **********But in certain markets -- like central Bergen County, which includes Ridgefield Park -- there are not many large blocks of contiguous class A space available. **********Most of the leasing now going on is prompted by corporate relocations within the county, Mr. Rudin said, noting that tenants could move and make good deals and that many were abandoning old space for new buildings. As a result, he added, there had not been substantial absorption of older space, which has a 24 percent vacancy rate. The vacancy rate for the entire northern New Jersey market is 18.9 percent. **********\"Speculative construction,\" Mr. Rudin said, \"is a thing of the past.\" **********Mr. Gold of Hartz agreed with that assessment. He noted that Overpeck Corporate Centre's location and access to a large labor pool would enable it to compete for tenants. It is linked to Route 46, the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstates 80 and 95 by a $4 million road network that Hartz built when it undertook the project. **********For UJB/Financial, the proximity of major highways played a role in its decision to move to Overpeck. The development was selected after a three-year search and from among 30 other sites in northern New Jersey, said Alan N. Posencheg, an executive vice president of the company. He said the favorable terms of the 20-year lease his company had signed for the building was another factor. **********Ridgefield Park's Mayor, Fred J. Criscuolo, described the project as a gold mine for the 1.9-square-mile community. He said it had fulfilled its promise to help revitalize the area and to balance the tax base in the primarily residential village, where homeowners had shouldered the burden of high property taxes for years. **********Mayor Crisuolo said that last year Overpeck, the community's largest ratable property, saved each household $340 on its tax bill. The development is now producing revenues of $1.5 million a year. **********Mr. Gold said there was land available for up to four more office buildings and the hotel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/business/forum-how-can-we-save-new-york-city.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "How Can We Save New York City?", "print_headline": "FORUM; How Can We Save New York City?", "body_text": " **********Ron Silver Actor and president of the Creative Coalition. **********Reestablish faith in the city's ability to improve things. We are overwhelmed by cynicism and a feeling that we can't do anything. We are able to overcome. There's a lot we could do: Start by reforming the State Legislature. It's corrupt to the bone.

Revitalize Midtown. The main thing is to reduce cynicism. A lot of people think New York is a failed enterprise. It isn't. Leonard Stern Chairman of the Hartz Group. The city has to send a signal to its two crucial industries -- tourism and people in commercial offices -- that New York is safe and attractive. The central business district is roughly the same as the central tourist district. That district has to be kept clean and safe. That's not expensive; it would probably cost less that $50 million a year. It would take a political will, because the outer boroughs would want a share of the budget, but the fact is, most businessmen and most tourists don't visit the outer boroughs.  Richard Ravitch President of the Citizen's Budget Commission. We must have a five-year fiscal plan involving the city and state that reflects trying honestly for credible, balanced budgets. They would have to include reductions in services and the allocation of the revenue burden, if necessary, to the largest tax base. The city and state have to work in a partnership. Lloyd A. Williams President of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce. All city employees, especially uniformed employees, must be residents of New York City. Law enforcement officers, in particular, are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but they're only on duty in the city during the workweek. That means that upwards of 70 percent of their call time goes to their own community. There is an economic spinoff of having a police officer living on the block.

Instead of warehousing vacant city property with the hope of selling it in a depressed market, encourage the expansion of the homesteading program for hardworking, serious New Yorkers.

If there were more severe punishments, there would be less money spent on jails. The money could be put into more beneficial means of bringing the city back. Ronald K. Shelp Head of the New York City Partnership. We've got to stop living in the past. New York's future has to include restructuring city government, downsizing the work force, new kinds of productivity initiatives and privatization. **********Jerrold Nadler Democratic Assemblyman from Manhattan. We have to try to regain the city's blue-collar economy by recreating a major port in New York. We can do that by reconnecting the city to the rest of the United States by rail freight. Everything now is transported from New York by truck, and the cost of getting freight in and out of the city by truck is tremendous. It has probably cost us 800,000 to 900,000 jobs in the last 25 years. Despite our natural geographic advantages, the Port of New York lags behind Baltimore and Norfolk, Va.

Then people can work and live in their neighborhoods. Philip Howard Lawyer and a vice president of the Municipal Art Society.  The loss of confidence in New York is the greatest danger to New York's economy. The villain is a city government that seems incapable of adapting or dealing with current problems. Our city government is also notoriously inefficient. The city makes the simplest venture cumbersome and costly. This is true for everyone: a homeless man recently told me he refused to go on welfare because he hated dealing with all the forms.  Carol Bellamy Managing director, Bear Sterns & Company. Multifaceted strategies are needed. Here are two: Streamline government. Improve our schools. Peter P. Smith President, Partnership for the Homeless. The city must find ways to translate far more of its vast wealth into a coordinated job training, education and skills development effort. We could start by requiring every service or production business to set aside a certain number of jobs for trainees whom they would train and subsidize until they are ready for full-time employment. Michael Musto Night-life columnist for the Village Voice. It would benefit our image and financial state to encourage a booming night life -- one that would pump glamour, excitement and revenue into the city that's always prided itself on having the most dazzling after-hours entertainment. Loosening cabaret laws and zoning regulations that make it difficult to open and run clubs would help maintain our reputation as the city that doesn't sleep. A tax cut would give us a reason to party. Stanley Aronowitz Sociology professor, CUNY Graduate Center.  New York is is a first-world city but it is also a third-world city. Because three-quarters of a million factory jobs have been lost in the last two decades, at least a third of the city's residents have no hope and no reason for hope in the future. We need a program to stimulate new small businesses, especially in production industries. City and state government should identify native skills and match them with industrial and market needs; persuade banks to make guaranteed low-interest loans, and impose commercial rent control to make cheap space available.

There's money to be had here! Sandra Feldman President, United Federation of Teachers. Invest in the schools and the children who will be in the work force of the 21st century. By cutting more than a half a billion dollars from the city's public schools, New York dealt a terrible blow to the competence of its future work force. Teachers can't turn out educated, adaptable young adults without a reasonable investment.  Dr. Ernest Drucker Professor of epidemiology and social medicine at Montefiore Medical Center. New York's immediate economic future is threatened by the related epidemics of AIDS and drug addiction. Both consume vast economic resources: over $1.3 billion for AIDS and over $2 billion for drug addiction. Our failure to offer adequate treatment or AIDS prevention services for the city's 200,000 injecting drug users virtually assures that they will continue to become infected themselves and, often, to infect their wives and children. Joe Dibona New York City cab driver. Stop pretending there are no classes in this country. The middle class has come down a lot. I was doing better 10 years ago. You have to make it on your own. Nobody gives a damn. Edwin Rubenstein Economist, adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and National Review columnist. Albany holds the key. I don't mean increased state aid -- that's clearly impossible. The state can, however, ease up on the myriad of costly rules and regulations it imposes on local governments. The most burdensome state mandate is Medicaid. Not only is the state's program egregiously expensive ($4,500 per patient here versus $2,100 per patient in the rest of the nation), but New York is one of the few states that require city governments to contribute anything at all to Medicaid. Caroline R. Jones President of Caroline Jones Advertising in Manhattan. Education. Education. Education. Illiteracy fosters ignorance, breeds intolerance, self-pity, boredom, crime and a host of other ills. Education is important not just for skills, but for the culture of the school. It is a place where children can learn responsibility and self-esteem. Jay Mazur President, International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Maintain manufacturing as the key to a balanced economy that builds on the strengths of New York's diverse and creative work force. The city's apparel industry, for example, provides over 100,000 entry-level jobs, mostly to newer immigrants.

After being frustrated by Iran, he turned against Kuwait. **********Last summer, in the midst of an oil glut partly caused by Kuwait's frantic step-up of sales to the West, Iraq stepped up its pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, among others, acceded. On July 27 an OPEC agreement raised the target price to $21 a barrel. At the time, John H. Lichtblau, a leading oil analyst, said of the agreement: \"It's a sea change. Higher prices were always within OPEC's grasp if they adhered to discipline. This time, discipline is guaranteed by a principal player which carries a loaded gun.\" **********In the new issue of Foreign Policy, Prof. M. A. Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology writes: \"As a beneficiary of this increase, Saudi Arabia conveniently ignored the Iraqi threat. But then the enforcer, like many before him, decided there was more profit as a hijacker.\" **********Now that the enforcer-hijacker's power has been broken, what happens to the oil price? Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, said in an interview yesterday, \"That depends on whether Saudi Arabia decides to keep its oil production up.\" He credited the Saudis with \"averting a bad problem\" during the oil embargo and the war. **********Despite the run-up past $40 a barrel early in the Persian Gulf confrontation, the oil price has come down almost to where it was a couple of weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last Aug. 2, but it is still well above the $13 price that Saudi light crude touched last June. Oil closed yesterday at $19.16. **********Mr. McCormack noted that OPEC's target price was still $21 a barrel, but said he favored \"letting the market do its thing.\" He opposed \"a misguided attempt\" by the United States or other governments to try to set the price. **********But Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other OPEC members can be expected to make a strong effort to stabilize the price at $21, the target set before the Iraqi invasion. They will argue that such a price will be crucial to pay for the reconstruction of Kuwait, including the cleanup of the oil-polluted gulf. They also argue that they need the money for plan to redistribute wealth to the poor Arab states, ostensibly to assuage the anger of poor Arab individuals and states against rich Arabs and their Western allies. **********Skeptics say such arguments are only rationalizations for the wealthy oil producers' desire to stabilize prices at a high level. **********But they may get some support in the West. Some American officials, who insisted on anonymity, said France would try to support the Arabs in this effort to stabilize oil prices, for two reasons: first, because President Francois Mitterrand is a Socialist and favors redistribution of income, and second and more important, because France wants to puts its arm around the shoulder of wealthy Arab countries and be in a position to get big contracts for building roads, air bases, factories, generating plants and weapons. **********But there could well be conflict within the United States Government on whether to seek a stabilized oil price at a high level; this is a position that might be supported both by contractors or oil producers looking for business in the Middle East and by domestic producers seeking wider profit maragins. Factors strengthening forces that want to see the Arab oil states earn more would be the huge United States budget deficit and the opposition to using taxpayer dollars to finance reconstruction in the gulf. **********Mr. McCormack contends, however, that it would be impossible to stabilize the oil price at a high level, even if the United States wanted to, because of the competition from natural gas, coal, nuclear and other energy sources. Further, he said, OPEC now controls less than half the world's oil. \"All previous oil price run-ups,\" he said, \"have resulted, without exception, from political acts, and it is a complete illusion that we could or would do that now -- nobody is prepared for it.\" Nevertheless, he expects OPEC, trying to counter the market, to \"do its thing.\" **********The resolution of these forces, in his view, will be an oil price of about $18. Professor Adelman thinks that with wide oscillations that price may be about right in the year ahead. Some oil industry analysts put the average price somewhat lower -- at $15 a barrel. **********The elimination of Iraq as the enforcer or hijacker makes it likely that a lower price than OPEC's $21 target will prevail, and the lower price will help to support American and world economic recovery. So, too, will the ample flow of contracts to United States companies and the replenishment of military stockpiles in the near future. Such factors are not great enough, relative to gross national product, to provide the basis for expecting a boom, but they do support expectations of a gradual American recovery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/10/business/the-media-business-new-toyota-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Toyota System", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Toyota System", "body_text": " **********The Toyota Motor Corporation said it had developed a new front-end suspension system for front-engine, front-wheel-drive cars.

Polly Peck's stock collapsed late last year. American Express did not elaborate on the statement. **********Shearson's annual revenues totaled $10.2 billion in 1990, down more than 18 percent from $12.5 billion in 1989, primarily because of decreased interest and dividend revenues. **********American Express attributed Shearson's poor performance to \"a continued and worsening industrywide slowdown in a difficult economic environment.\"  Commissions Are Down **********Brokerage commission revenues were down 18 percent, to $1.6 billion. Revenue from market-making and principal transactions were down 5.5 percent, to $1.2 billion. Investment banking revenues dropped 41.5 percent, to $563 million. And investment advisory revenues fell 7.5 percent, to $633 million. **********American Express said its management had met its targets for reducing expenses. Shearson's fixed expenses were cut 9 percent, or $266 million, from 1989 levels. What American Express described as \"fourth-quarter, ongoing fixed expenses\" were reduced by $86 million from fourth quarter 1989, or $344 million on an annualized basis. **********Ms. Dean noted that Shearson had made some progress in cutting staff costs, but she said it still had a long way to go. Last year, the number of stockbrokers declined 16 percent, to 8,711, and the overall Shearson work force fell 12 percent, to 31,300.  Gains at Charge-Card Unit **********Meanwhile, American Express's mainstay business, the charge-card and travel division known as Travel Related Services, reported an annual profit of $956 million, up 15 percent from $830 million a year earlier.

Visitors from Europe and the United States are staying away, apparently frightened by this nation's ethnic violence. Local tourism agents estimate that this year they are seeing only 10 percent as many visitors as last year. Destination for Westerners **********With tourism booming in Eastern Europe since the fall of Communist governments, Yugoslavia had expected business to improve. For the last decade, Yugoslavia has carved out a singular niche among Eastern European nations. While Bulgaria, Romania and even Hungary catered largely to visitors from other Communist countries, Yugoslavia successfully marketed itself as a cheap, sunny destination for Westerners. **********The collapse of the nation's tourism, a $2.7 billion business last year, is one of the worst economic consequences of the conflicts that threaten to tear this country apart. Ljubica Milojevic, chief of the research department at the Tourism Association of Yugoslavia, said that bookings nationwide were off 60 to 80 percent from last year. **********Tourism has been one of Yugoslavia's leading sources of Western currencies, she said, employing 400,000 and accounting for about 3 percent of gross national product. More than 9 million foreigners visited Yugoslavia in 1990, about 40 percent from Germany. **********In better times, Split, a city of 280,000, was one of the nation's chief attractions. Its walled old city, built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian in the years 300 to 304, is one of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Europe. Local legend has it that the emperor settled here because of the waters, the beautiful women and the absence of earthquakes. Near Empty Restaurant **********But on a recent Saturday evening in Split, the Adrijana Restaurant, known for its seafood, served its first and only customers at 10 P.M. They were foreign journalists covering Yugoslavia's latest crisis. **********On the sidewalk out front, several people lurked in the shadows, approaching anyone who could possibly be a tourist with their forlorn, multi-lingual pleas: \"Room? Zimmer? Camara? Sobe?\" **********At the Bellevue Hotel nearby, Vjenceslav Perkov, a manager there, lamented the lack of traffic. \"Yugoslavia is a beautiful country with the most beautiful sea in the world,\" he said. \"This political situation has had a terrible influence on tourism. If events do not calm down, many hotels here will have to close down.\" **********Yugoslavia's tourism has long added to the disputes among the nation's six republics. More than 80 percent of tourist dollars and Deutsche marks are spent in Split, Dubrovnik and other coastal communities in the republic of Croatia. The republics have bickered for years over how much the federal Government should invest in projects like constructing new roads to the seashore, which some argue would mainly benefit Croatia. Serbians Block Road **********Recently, the tourist business has become a target for Croatia's restive Serbian minority. Last year, Serbs challenging the newly elected nationalist government in Croatia blocked the main road from Western Europe to the coast, causing a sharp decline in late-season bookings. About half of the coast's tourists come from Germany, and the main auto route crosses the republic's Serbian areas. **********This year, tourism prospects dimmed when Yugoslav Army tanks rolled through the streets of Belgrade in February to quell rioting. Croatian officials said that events this spring then destroyed their last hopes of salvaging the season. **********Rebel Serbs seized the Plitvice national park in Croatia, whose water falls and forests form the backdrop for many of the country's tourism posters. When paramilitary policemen stormed the park on Easter Sunday, a bus filled with Italian tourists was caught in the crossfire. Their quick-witted driver ordered passengers to crouch on the floor, averting any injuries. **********The violence has intensified. First, clashes between Serbs and Croatians left at least 18 dead. Then, an anti-Army protest in Split turned into a riot that led to the fatal shooting of a 19-year old conscript. Airlift on Standby **********Even before these troubles, travel agents in Split had received little more than cancellations and unusual requests. Some Belgian tourists said they would come to the region only with a guarantee that if ethnic strife broke out, they would immediately be airlifted out. A plane was reserved, but not needed. **********Ana Manzoni, director of the foreign travel division at Dalmacijaturist, a worker-owned agency with annual revenues of $150 million, said she foresaw layoffs if business did not pick up. **********\"The damage has already been done,\" she said, after hearing Prime Minister Ante Markovic address reporters at the nation's annual tourism convention. \"At best, we may end up with 40 percent of last year, which was not a good year.

This was evident in the guards surrounding Prince Aleksandar strutting in uniforms bearing patches proclaiming \"Serbian Army.\" It was also manifest in the presence of Serbian Orthodox priests and nuns, of royal insignia and banners, and the singing of Serbian hymns and anthems. **********The Prince is to leave Monday after 36 hours here, but other princes and princesses are arriving to honor his grandfather at Oplenac Wednesday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/09/business/the-media-business-nbc-news-lays-off-18-workers.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1991-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NBC News Lays Off 18 Workers", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC News Lays Off 18 Workers", "body_text": " **********Eighteen NBC News employees were laid off on Friday, and an official of their union said a grievance would be filed this week accusing the network of violating the union contract. **********The union may also charge NBC with sex and age discrimination, said John Clark, the president of Local 11 of the National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians. **********Mr. Clark said the union would charge that NBC violated an agreement not to lay off more than 4 percent of the union-represented employees of NBC News this year and that NBC put the layoffs into effect without first offering another round of buyouts. **********Peggy Hubble, the director of press relations for NBC News, said, \"Laying people off is never easy, but this decision was made in complete accordance with the union contract.\" **********NBC has had longstanding problems with the union, which waged a strike against NBC for more than 100 days in 1987.

The United States plans to nurture such compromises, first from the sidelines and later as a direct mediator with bridging proposals of its own if the parties alone cannot make any headway. The U.S. Balancing Act **********The trick, say American officials, will be to carry out such mediation without supplanting the direct, face-to-face encounter between the parties, which is essential for changing how they look at, and deal with, one another. **********The Administration's strategy, said one senior policy maker, is based on the assumption that over time \"the very act of the parties' sitting down will begin to shatter mythologies on both sides.\" In particular, they hope to destroy the Israeli argument that there are no Arabs to talk to, and the Arab argument that all the Israelis want is Arab lands. **********But for those long-held views to be shed, and for concrete peace agreements to be produced, the senior official added, \"it is critical that this process continue over time.\" Defining Areas of Substance **********He elaborated: \"The longer these negotiations go on, the greater the likelihood that areas of substance will be defined to hook them into something that in fact is a real negotiation.\" **********Officials acknowledge that this strategy is untested, and has three potential weaknesses. First, they could discover that the problem between Arabs and Israelis is not that they fail to understand each other, but that they understand each other all too well, and therefore the more they talk directly, the more the fundamental disagreements will be highlighted instead of bridged. **********Second, a change of the atmosphere and dynamics between Arab nations and Israel ultimately requires change within the countries. Is a minority Government like Syria's -- dominated by members of the small Alawite sect of Islam in a country with a Sunni Muslim majority -- really ready to end its conflict with Israel and slash its army? Can Israel's governing Likud party, whose very raison d'etre is its commitment to keeping the West Bank, conclude agreements that would gut its ideological core? **********Third, the United States did not get the parties to agree to talk by gentle dialogue, but by using economic clout over Israel, by letting the leaders of Saudi Arabia know that they owed Washington for the Persian Gulf war, by using the Soviet Union and the Saudis to press the Syrians and by tacitly threatening the Palestinians with international isolation.  Washington's Hardball Tactics **********American officials say privately they know that these same hardball tactics, if not tougher ones, will be required to promote actual agreements. But the challenge will be to twist arms without contradicting the terms of the conference, which President Bush described innocently on Friday as not intended \"to impose a settlement\" but \"to bring people together so they can achieve a settlement.\" **********For now, Washington is not discussing these issues publicly. To pursue its strategy -- which was worked out by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Administration's senior Middle East experts, Dennis B. Ross, Daniel C. Kurtzer, Aaron D. Miller, Richard N. Haass and William J. Burns -- Washington has evolved a game plan. **********It deals with each phase of the talks: from the three-day opening conference at the Royal Palace in Madrid starting on Wednesday, through the first bilateral negotiations that will follow that meeting and into the third phase of detailed negotiations. **********Phase one in the Administration's strategy involves getting the most mileage from the ceremonial opening in Madrid. Bush's Presentation **********President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will address the opening session. Mr. Bush is planning to use the opportunity, officials say, to lay out a broad American vision of why peace is in everyone's interest, as well as what Washington regards as the basic ingredients of a settlement -- themes like trading land for real peace. **********Already, the two sides have publicly put forward their well-known positions. The Arabs have insisted that Israel give up all of the territory it gained in the 1967 war -- namely the Golan Heights, which once was controlled by Syria; the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which once were under Jordanian control, and the Gaza Strip, which was controlled by Egypt. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Government has repeated its position that it does not intend to give up any more land. **********While the Administration does not expect any party to drop or modify its basic positions at this opening session, it is nevertheless quietly coaching Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians to use their opening speeches to convey the message that there really are new possibilities. **********For instance, the Administration would like the Israelis at least to hint, even vaguely, that the Golan Heights might be negotiable -- or to say that while Israel wants to keep that territory forever, it is looking forward to hearing Syria's views on the subject because alternatives might be possible. **********Similarly, the Administration is urging the Syrians at least to hint that the payoff for Israel if it returns the Golan Heights, with its commanding view of northern Israel and of Damascus, could be more than just nonbelligerency, but real peace. **********Phase two of the talks starts after the opening, when Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon and Israel and the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation are supposed to sit down for separate, face-to-face, two-way negotiations.  Confidence-Building Gestures **********The Administration wants these talks to evolve in two stages. Washington expects the parties to make conflicting demands. But it hopes to prevent these collisions from derailing the bilateral talks by encouraging the parties to consider first trading small, confidence-building gestures. **********For instance, Administration officials say they hope to encourage a deal in which Israel would agree to suspend building settlements in the occupied territories in return for suspension of the Arab economic boycott of Israel and suspension of the Palestinian uprising, against Israel. **********Prime Minister Shamir has rejected such a deal already. Washington is talking to the Israelis as well as to the Saudis and other Arabs about ways to \"sweeten the pot\" for all sides. **********Exactly how the United States will make its suggestions, though, raises what American officials say is the most sensitive aspect of the bilateral talks. How does the United States encourage the parties to keep talking long enough to produce psychological transformations without stepping in and becoming a mediator interfering with the give-and-take of direct talks? Standing Outside, Whispering **********According to the conference invitation, Washington is allowed to attend the bilateral talks only if both sides invite it. Initially at least, the Israelis are unlikely to do that, because they want to underscore the face-to-face aspect of talks and the implicit recognition this connotes. **********Therefore, said an American, Washington's representatives will stand \"just outside the door,\" whispering to both sides. **********\"We have told all parties that we expect these to be genuine and meaningful negotiations,\" said a senior American official. \"Our role will be to go in at times to offer advice on how best to approach certain problems. We are not going to go in and say, 'You ought to do it this way or that way.' But we will say: 'Hey, if you are going to present something that way, you are bound to get the following response. So you need to think that if you are going to say X you have to couple it with Y.' \" **********When President Carter mediated between Egypt and Israel in 1978 and when Henry Kissinger mediated between Syria and Israel after the 1973 war, both Americans had a very clear idea of what the bottom lines were for all parties. Arabs and Israelis sought American intervention to bridge their positions; this time Washington forced the parties together. **********The framework for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians is already agreed on. The two sides, according to the conference invitation, will begin with \"talks on interim self-government arrangements\" for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********But the Israeli-Syrian negotiations have no agreed framework. Washington's first challenge is to find some imaginative way to bridge Syria's desire for a return of total sovereignty over the Golan Heights with the Israelis' insistence on not giving up the strategic high ground. **********The second challenge posed by the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, say American officials, is that if they deadlock, the Syrians not be allowed to exercise a veto over the Israeli-Palestinian talks. **********But this is easier said than done. The Syrians have already announced that they are not going to take part in the multilateral talks between Israel, Jordan, the Palestinians, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, which are supposed to accompany the bilateral negotiations. These talks will deal with regional problems like water, arms control, refugees and economic development. **********Washington has managed to persuade the other Arabs to go despite the Syrian objection, but the Syrians struck a quiet deal in Damascus last Wednesday with the Saudis and other Gulf Arabs in which the Arabs promised Syria that while they would engage the Israelis in a dialogue in these multilateral talks, they would not \"close\" any agreements until Syria was satisfied that Israel would cede territory in the bilateral negotiations, Arab diplomats said.

Novell is to develop versions of Netware for I.B.M.'s high-end personal computers and mid-range systems, which will run on top of I.B.M.'s OS/2 and AIX-Unix operating systems. I.B.M., in turn, will develop the fittings necessary for Netware and LAN Server to work together seamlessly on large business networks. Officials at both companies say the alliance does not involve any financial dealings. **********For their customers, the plans are good news. Novell Netware, which works with almost all major brands of personal computers, has become the network operating software of choice at the departmental level for most businesses because it is relatively simple and inexpensive to install. I.B.M.'s networking efforts, on the other hand, have been strongest at the top, reaching down from the big, central computing systems for which I.B.M. is famous. **********By embracing Netware and integrating it with LAN Server, I.B.M. will in theory eventually be able to connect mainframes, minicomputers, engineering work stations, powerful network PC's called servers, desktop PC's, dumb terminals and even portable computers with a unified system of plumbing. Information would flow through the plumbing \"transparently,\" meaning that an executive could log on to the networked system at any machine, using a standard set of commands, and have access to all information regardless of where it resides. **********But such a system may take years to evolve. \"Rome was not built in a day,\" said James A. Cannavino, an I.B.M. vice president and general manager of its personal systems division. Nor was Rome built without intrigue and some bloodletting. In embracing Novell, I.B.M. appears to be turning its back on the Microsoft Corporation, which is developing a rival operating system for local area networks, called LAN Manager. **********Although I.B.M. and Novell have worked together for several years in developing networked systems for schools, I.B.M. has largely ignored Netware in the business market. Instead, I.B.M. has licensed Microsoft's LAN Manager technology and has incorporated aspects of it into its own LAN Server software. I.B.M. says it will continue to support LAN Server, but it will now compete directly with Microsoft's LAN Manager by selling Netware as well. **********I.B.M. and Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., and is the nation's largest personal computer software company, have had a very close relationship since the early days of the personal computer industry. But the two companies have clashed repeatedly on the direction that system software will take in the future. **********Playing to the large base of low-end PC's installed around the world, Microsoft emphasizes the DOS and Windows operating systems; I.B.M., whose interests lie in selling newer and more powerful PC's, emphasizes OS/2 and Presentation Manager. **********Mr. Cannavino sought to downplay the notion that the I.B.M.-Microsoft rift has become irreconcilable. \"Our interests overlap in some areas, and they compete in some areas,\" he said. A Microsoft official at the show said only that the I.B.M.-Novell alliance \"sounds like it will be good for OS/2,\" which Microsoft continues to develop. **********Rival computer makers said they were not particularly concerned by the I.B.M.-Novell alliance. \"It's good for the industry,\" said a spokesman for the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston, which itself has a strategic alliance with Novell. \"If it widens the acceptance of Netware and network computing, it will help us sell more computers.\" **********The Digital Equipment Corporation, the second-largest computer maker after I.B.M., also announced its support for Novell's Netware at the show. **********Digital stopped short of selling Netware, however, and simply announced plans to have its own Pathworks network operating system, based on Microsoft's LAN Manager technology, coexist with Netware. Digital also announced a number of improvements to the Pathworks software. **********The I.B.M.-Novell alliance was not the only major news of the show.  Motorola introduced its wireless networking system and the Lotus Development Corporation, a Notes update. Both will be discussed next week. Compaq's Change of Heart **********One of the most significant announcements at the show had little to do with products. Compaq, which since its beginning in 1982 has referred all customer problems and complaints to its dealers, said that it would soon offer direct telephone support, through a toll-free line, that will providing answers to basic questions and product information. **********For complex computing problems that require expert answers, Compaq will offer, for $3,000, a contract for direct telephone technical support for business customers. **********Compaq's change of heart demonstrates the profound changes taking place in computer technology, the way personal computers are used in businesses and the way these computers are sold. Compaq also designated about 10 percent of its dealers as a special category that will specialize in issues relating to local area networking. **********\"Frankly, these changes are necessary given how complex networking is getting,\" said Edward R. Anderson, president of the Computerland Corporation of Pleasanton, Calif., Compaq's largest dealer. **********Some personal computers, including Compaq's Systempro and its desktop machines based on Intel's i486 chip, are becoming more powerful and complex, rivaling minicomputers and even mainframes in power. Most dealers lack the expertise to support the systems they sell, and if such a system fails, the customer is often shunted from one company to another. Under the $3,000 contract, Compaq will now offer to fix as many as 10 major corporate computing problems, whenever they occur, even if the problem does not involve Compaq computers. **********\"It's an important move,\" said Lee Levitt, an analyst with the International Data Corporation in Framingham, Mass. \"Compaq is saying, 'Reach out and touch us.' \""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/03/business/company-news-macy-is-planning-store-in-denver.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Macy Is Planning Store in Denver", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Macy Is Planning Store in Denver", "body_text": " **********R.

Because Hong Kong depends a great deal on China for its economic livelihood, the vote, which makes likely the prospect of unconditional extension of the benefits, touched off even greater business optimism.  Stock Market at a High **********For two straight days now, the Hang Seng stock market index has hit a new high, closing today at 4,028.77, up nearly 19 points from Tuesday's record. Housing prices are also estimated to have risen at least 10 percent since the airport agreement was announced on July 4. And for the first time since the Army crackdown in Beijing two years ago, there seems to be a measure of hope in the air here. **********Hong Kong's confidence has been shaken not only by the political repression and ideological orthodoxy on the home turf of its future landlord, but also by the arrests of Hong Kong visitors on the mainland and a rising number of mainlanders sneaking into the territory and committing robberies. Emigrants continue to flee the territory at a pace of over 1,100 a week. **********Now, with major uncertainties removed, politicians, business executives and bureaucrats here are turning to the nuts and bolts of the airport and port project, which is expected to dominate the economy until 1997 and cost more than $16 billion.  Caution and Foreboding **********As with all bouts of optimism in Hong Kong in the last decade, however, this one is mixed with caution and a foreboding that China's verbal assaults may once again cloud the skies. **********The agreement provides that China will support the construction of the airport in Hong Kong and will honor Hong Kong's debts after 1997. In exchange, Britain agrees to consult Beijing on all matters relating to the airport that will have an impact after 1997. Academics and politicians say the document is a crucial annex to the original joint declaration in 1984, which provides the basis for the handover of power. Some say it could set a precedent for power-sharing on all matters straddling 1997. **********\"China got what it wanted -- it got a formal acknowledgment of their role prior to 1997,\" said a diplomat in Hong Kong. The Chinese, he added, are believed to have suggested registering the memorandum as a treaty with the United Nations, as was the case with the 1984 Joint Declaration, but the British said no.  Risk of Imported Labor **********As companies enter the contract bidding in the next few months for certain parts of the airport project, the Government is suggesting that the construction activity will add more than a full percentage point to Hong Kong's economic growth estimates in the near future. Costs for the airport and rail and bridge links will be $12.7 billion and billions more for the port development. **********Although the political uncertainty may be removed for the moment, some economists and analysts say the endeavor will still stumble. For instance, a construction boom could be inflationary, unless the Government allows the import of labor. Another major risk that investors and bankers must consider is that all the connecting parts, such as the rail link, the suspension bridge and the airport, must be completed before any one can be used. **********For the moment, the general public is busy with Hong Kong's favorite pastime: making money. Last week, the first Government land sale since the memorandum brought a price that was more than double the one reached for a similar plot in the same area last November. And there are some indications that the small investor also wants to keep investing in Hong Kong."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/world/after-the-war-over-steep-turkish-passes-the-kurds-start-back-to-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1991-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Over Steep Turkish Passes, the Kurds Start Back to Iraq", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Over Steep Turkish Passes, the Kurds Start Back to Iraq", "body_text": " **********The movement of Kurdish refugees back to Iraq from their grisly camps in the mountains of southern Turkey appears to be starting in earnest. **********United States Army helicopters today flew 325 Kurdish men from Isikveren, one of Turkey's biggest and most desolate refugee centers, to help build the resettlement encampment of blue and white tents in the river valley outside Zakho, in northern Iraq. **********Special Forces officers running the airlift plan to bring in at least 250 more Kurds from other border encampments each day for the next three days, in an effort to build enthusiasm for the move among the refugees. **********There were about 6,000 volunteers for the pick-and-shovel jobs in the Zakho camp this morning, said Dayton Maxwell, the United States Agency for International Development's specialist in charge of disaster relief here.  Some Now Return Voluntarily **********Perhaps more significantly, in the nameless valleys and gorges scattered along the Iraqi side of the mountains, people were coming back on their own today, in groups of tens and twenties, building into the hundreds. They climbed over high passes and ridges from Turkey onto footpaths that turned into dirt tracks and finally, roads. **********The returning refugees had little to carry -- perhaps a blanket, a transistor radio, a few belongings bundled into a makeshift pack. Mostly they walked, but on some roads there were donkeys carrying bundles or refugees packed into a truck bumping down the road. **********The mass flight of Iraqi Kurds for the Turkish and Iranian frontiers began when Iraq's forces crushed a Kurdish rebellion last month in the aftermath of its defeat in the Persian Gulf war. The United Nations estimates there are 416,000 refugees at this border and farther within Turkey, while 200,000 to 400,000 are reported on the Iraqi side of the border. More than a million people have fled to Iran, the United Nations says; on Friday, it doubled its estimate of the daily death toll among the refugees, from 1,000 to 2,000. **********American military and aid officials hope that once movement of the Kurds and other refugees back to their homes in Iraq begins, it will become a mass flow, as their exodus was. **********About 200 families returned to their homes in Zakho last night, Mr. Maxwell said. That number would surely have swelled today. **********A major factor in the growing movement appeared to be the removal of several hundred armed Iraqis described as policemen, but widely believed to be soldiers or security agents. **********But on a number of roads, Kurdish guerrillas known as Pesh Merga (those who face death) kept some refugees back, saying the streets were still unsafe, in an apparent effort to assert their authority. A local commander said about 3,000 of the guerrillas have gathered on the outskirts of the zone protected by Western forces, where half a dozen refugee camps are planned. **********Mr. Maxwell, explaining the airlift of the Kurdish refugee workers, which has been worked out over the last week with traditional clan chiefs, said:  Momentum Needed **********\"The important thing is to break the ice and get some momentum going. They are very anxious to come, and now that the flow has started, we will get supplies in place and start moving people through.\" **********At Zakho today, First Lieut. Joel Baker of the Marine Corps, whose combat engineering platoon hammered together the 1,000-tent camp at Zakho in a hurry, watched refugee families coming back to town along the main highway. They were packed into carts pulled by tractors. **********\"The marines put up this place to give the Kurds their freedom,\" he said. \"It makes you feel good to see how hard work can change people's lives.\" **********The roads on the Iraqi side showed the haste with which the refugees moved out, taking off in every vehicle that moved, including fire trucks, garbage trucks, buses, ambulances and taxicabs. **********High in a mountain valley, more than an hour's drive from the last visible population center at the village of Darkar, a group of 17 refugees paused to rest in the shade of a tree before passing two abandoned municipal fire trucks on their way back to Zakho. **********\"I want to go home,\" said Hayam Haji, a 12-year-old girl. \"Zakho is better to live in. I am not happy because Saddam is still in power. When Saddam is gone, I will be happy.\"  Taking Precautions **********A man going back to the town said: \"I'm going back to Zakho to look at the house and see if everything is all right. If the Pesh Merga are in the town and everything is all right, I will go back.\" **********But the bright day, in which British marines and fresh paratroopers manned positions hard by the roadblocks of the Kurdish guerrillas, barely concealed the Mideast tribal blood feuds that could spell trouble for the coalition forces committed to keeping the peace here. **********\"The situation is not stable now,\" said a guerrilla leader named Mohammed Shafik, at a roadblock only a few miles from the last roadblock set up this morning on the main highway by American and British marines. \"Due to this instability, we will keep our weapons.\" **********\"We have many reservations about Saddam Hussein,\" he said, referring to the agreement reportedly reached between the Iraqi President and some Kurdish leaders. \"We have to be alert in our minds. We have had many bad experiences.\" **********At another roadblock, a guerrilla leader who gave his names as Abu Zira put the score-settling to come bluntly: \"We don't want anybody who was appointed by Saddam Hussein. **********\"I think the British, Americans and French will remain as long as it is in their interest,\" he said. \"When it is not in their interest they will leave.

Polls show that Mr. Genscher is still held in high esteem by the German public, but he has been the target of stinging criticism from many political leaders, including some who supported him in the past. **********During the gulf crisis, Mr. Genscher was criticized for appearing reluctant to support the anti-Iraq coalition. More recently, he has been caught up in arguments over the possible use of German troops in future conflicts. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl has publicly defended Mr. Genscher and reprimanded his critics. But the criticism has continued. Western Alignment Urged **********Hans Stercken, chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and a senior member of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, has been urging that Germany align its foreign policy more closely with other Western nations. **********\"We can no longer go our own way in the world,\" Mr. Stercken said in a recent interview. **********Leaders of the Christian Democratic Union's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have been even more outspoken. The party's general secretary, Erwin Huber, called last week for a \"clear course correction\" in German foreign policy. **********\"Foreign Minister Genscher's prolonged speechlessness during the gulf crisis has seriously damaged our image in the world,\" Mr. Huber said. **********Hans Streibl, Premier of Bavaria and an important ally of Chancellor Kohl, has described Mr. Genscher as \"minister of travel and television.\" Finance Minister Theo Waigel complained that in recent months Mr. Genscher \"has not always been where he should have been.\" Accused of Quasi-Neutralism **********Mr. Genscher has been Foreign Minister since 1974, longer than any of his Western counterparts. At several points in his tenure, he has irritated officials in Washington and other allied capitals by appearing not to support Western initiatives fully. They accused him of a quasi-neutralism that came to be known as Genscherism. **********Fundamental to Genscherism was said to be the belief that Germany could play a role as a bridge between East and West without losing its status as a reliable NATO ally. Mr. Genscher is a strong advocate of negotiated settlements to international problems, and critics say he occasionally takes that credo too far. **********Last year, after the United Nations endorsed military action against Iraq, Mr. Genscher again provoked Western criticism by supporting several unsuccessful peace initiatives. **********In a speech last month in Switzerland, Mr. Genscher rejected charges that he had acted against the interests of the anti-Iraq alliance. He said he had always given the alliance \"clear and unequivocal\" support. **********\"Germany is carrying more than its fair share of the burden for the establishment of a peaceful, peacefully evolving world,\" he said. Larger German Voice Urged **********Soon after delivering that speech, Mr. Genscher suggested that if foreign powers expect Germany to assume greater responsibility in the world, they should give it a chance to express its views \"more strongly\" in the United Nations Security Council. **********His comments were widely interpreted as a call for a German seat on the Security Council. Officials in France, which holds one of the five permanent Council seats, immediately rejected the idea. **********Germany did not send troops to join the anti-Iraq coalition because of a constitutional clause that severely limits the use of German military power abroad. In recent weeks, Mr. Kohl has been seeking to amend that clause, but he has had little success. **********The opposition Social Democrats voted on Monday to oppose the amendment proposed by Mr. Kohl, which would have allowed German troops to take part in multinational operations sanctioned by the United Nations. Mr. Genscher's party, the Free Democrats, took a similar stance. **********The positions taken by the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats mean that Mr. Kohl's proposed amendment is probably dead. Gulf Cost Issue Raised **********Washington's irritation with Germany may be rekindled by suggestions being made in Bonn that the Government renege on its pledge of $11 billion to help defray the costs of the gulf war. The Social Democrats have asserted that the United States is seeking contributions that far exceeded the actual cost of thewar. **********Finance Minister Waigel is to travel to Washington on Monday to discuss the matter with American officials. **********American officials have refrained from publicly criticizing Mr. Genscher or the Bonn Government. They still consider Germany a reliable ally, and according to public opinion polls in the United States, most Americans agree. **********\"This generosity in the assessment of the Germans could be based on the fact that the war was won so quickly and with so few casualties,\" said a recent editorial in the Suddeutsche Zeitung. \"If a single American unit had been wiped out in an Iraqi poison-gas attack, or if Saddam had fired a single poison-gas missile at Israel, the Germans would be in trouble in the United States for a long time.

Gorbachev today and indicated that he was inclined to find a way to satisfy the Soviet leader's request for emergency aid to buy American food. **********\"When you look at the accomplishments of Mikhail Gorbachev, they are enormous,\" Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference, going out of his way to praise the Soviet leader. \"And yes, the Soviet Union is fighting difficult economic times. But I am not about to forget history. And what he did in terms of Eastern Europe, what he's done in terms of perestroika and glasnost, has my respect.\" **********In Moscow, Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov said that if the West was truly interested in the success of economic reforms in the Soviet Union, it could not take a \"wait and see\" attitude toward providing aid.  [ Page A12. ] Ties Seems to Improve **********Developments in recent days suggest that Soviet-American relatons are improving again after a period of coolness that began when Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned as Foreign Minister in December and Moscow cracked down violently against independence movements in the Baltic republics. **********An implicit deal seems to be in the making in which Mr. Gorbachev will satisfy American concerns about the conventional arms treaty, Mr. Bush will help him with more economic aid, and they will both agree to hold a summit meeting in June or July, when they will focus on the still uncompleted strategic arms reduction treaty. **********Mr. Bush, in a meeting today with Baltic leaders, was quoted by his visitors as speaking freely about his coming meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, although arrangements have not been completed. **********In addition, reports from Moscow indicate that Parliament this weekend may pass a law lifting legal barriers against travel abroad, something long demanded by the United States before remaining trade barriers can be removed. **********In discussing the Soviet request for additional credits to buy more American grain, Mr. Bush said, \"I've always felt that when people are hungry or need support as it relates to food and nourishment that we ought to try to help.\" Still Undecided on Method **********But Mr. Bush quickly went on to say that he had still not decided how to respond to Mr. Gorbachev's appeal for the United States to guarantee up to $1.5 billion worth of commercial bank loans by the Soviets to purchase American grain -- largely because by law the Administration cannot extend more such guarantees unless the Soviets are deemed a credit-worthy borrower, which they no longer are by the international banking community. **********Administration officials said, however, that the President has asked his aides to look for alternative ways to extend food aid or technical assistance to the Soviets and that this was now being explored by a variety of departments. **********Mr. Bush's lavish praise for Mr. Gorbachev today, and his strong hint that he would provide some sort of economic help, were in marked contrast to his public position last week. He said then that \"regrettably\" the Soviets could not meet the requirements of credit-worthiness, and he left the impression that as a result no American help would be forthcoming. **********Since then, though, Mr. Shevardnadze met with Mr. Bush on Monday and appealed for help. And Mr. Gorbachev agreed Tuesday to send the Soviet Chief of Staff, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, to Washington next week to try to resolve the last disputes over the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe. **********The Soviets have virtually used up all of the $1 billion in credit guarantees that Mr. Bush granted them through the Commodity Credit Corporation in December to buy grain to get them through the winter. With Washington guaranteeing the loans, the Soviets could not only get them from commercial banks, which would not normally lend them money, but also get a better interest rate. **********Mr. Gorbachev's reason for seeking more help and the Administration's inability to give it automatically have to do with several factors that have developed since December. **********First, the United States farm bill that went into effect in 1991 tightened up the conditions for agricultural credits by stipulating that the Secretary of Agriculture had to be able to affirm that a country receiving such benefits could service its debts. **********Second, with the Soviet foreign debt now $60 billion and rising, Moscow has become less able to repay many of its commercial lenders, and is now in arrears. **********Third, last fall, when the Soviet winter grain crop was being planted for harvesting this spring, its economy was experiencing widespread dislocations, with shortages of seed, fertilizer, tractors, fuel and workers prepared to do their jobs properly. Administration experts are predicting not only a poor Soviet harvest this spring, but also a poor spring planting, which will reduce the fall harvest needed to take the Soviets through next winter. **********The impulse to help Mr. Gorbachev is not simply motivated by his cooperative behavior in Eastern Europe and in the Persian Gulf, officials say, but also by the feeling in Washington that he is making a real push to complete the conventional and strategic arms control treaties, which the Administration is eager to lock in. **********Administration officials say they are also inclined to help Mr. Gorbachev because if they do not, there could be more serious upheavals in the Soviet Union this year, which could spill over into Eastern Europe. **********At the same time, extending new food credits to the Soviets is viewed by some in the Administration as the equivalent of giving drugs to an addict, since it is increasingly clear that the Soviet leader is either unable or unwilling to adopt the real free-market economic reforms that might one day make such credits unnecessary. **********Among the alternative approaches being considered would be for the President to extend bank loans or food aid under his discretion to meet humanitarian disasters, although this would require declaring a disaster in the Soviet Union, which would be complicated. **********Another option is to use the up to $300 million in credits that could be secured through the Export-Import Bank. A third option, already in the works, is to send a team from the Department of Agriculture this month to advise the Soviets on how to reorganize their farm distribution system.

But the craft, which docked yesterday with the Soviet Union's Mir space station and is to return to earth next Sunday, did not carry the millions of dollars worth of Western advertisements that were originally planned to make the mission profitable for the Soviet Union. **********\"Because of the economic and political situation in the Soviet Union, companies doubted the Russians could deliver,\" said Danny Rose, an account director at Saatchi & Saatchi Sports Events and Licensing, the British advertising agency that was retained to sell corporate sponsorships for the mission. \"There was never any doubt that the Russians could put someone in space. But in terms of the commercial opportunities, that proved more difficult.\" **********When the space mission was announced in June 1989, Saatchi & Saatchi, the world's second-largest advertising company, after the WPP Group, was given responsibility for its marketing. **********Saatchi's experts on corporate identity gave the joint mission its name, Juno, after the Roman goddess of marriage. They designed a logotype of a flying goose. MSL International, a Saatchi subsidiary that specializes in recruitment advertising, took charge of finding the British astronaut, and placed newspaper ads headlined: \"Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.\" **********Another Saatchi subsidiary was sought to sell corporate sponsorships for the mission. The Moscow Narodny Bank, a Soviet-owned British bank that was organizing Juno, said it planned to sell $:16 million ($28 million) worth of sponsorships, in packages of $:1 million to $:2 million, that could include billboards at the launching site, ads on the side of the spaceship and patches on the British astronaut's uniform. **********But when Juno was launched on Friday, there were no ads at the Baikonur space center, on the Soyuz rocket or on Ms. Sharman's uniform. **********\"The Soviet side had started off with an estimate they felt was achievable, but was not realistic,\" said Michael Parker, the chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi's worldwide business-to-business advertising network, who directed the Juno project for the agency. **********By December 1989, after getting in touch with more than 50 companies, the agency had managed to arrange only three sponsorships, including one from Memorex videotapes, at costs that started at $:500,000, a sum comparable to the price a company would pay to be the main sponsor of a world-class rugby or skiing event, Mr. Rose said. **********Late last year, when it had become clear that Juno would not come close to raising $:16 million, the Moscow Narodny Bank scuttled its plans for a commercially sponsored mission but said it would forge ahead without the ads, footing the bill itself. **********The sale of sponsorships was hindered by a dearth of information about the mission, Saatchi executives said. **********\"It was very difficult working with the Russian authorities to really identify what would and wouldn't be possible,\" Mr. Rose said. \"Would it be possible to take a pocket calculator on board? If I wanted to pitch a sponsorship to a communications company, would their equipment be compatible with the Mir's signals? I never had a 100 percent concrete book of benefits I could go to a sponsor with.\" Japanese Sponsorship **********The Soviet Union's only previous involvement with ads in space was last year, when the Tokyo Broadcasting System paid it an amount reported as $12 million to send a Japanese journalist into space. Several companies, including Sony and Minolta, bought sponsorships that included logotypes on the side of that rocket. **********Without Saatchi's help, Moscow Narodny Bank signed three sponsors for the Juno mission: Olympus cameras, the Poqet Computer Corporation and Interflora, a flower-delivery service. **********Joanna Dodd, a spokeswoman for the mission in London, said, \"It has not been disclosed and never will be how much they paid.\" Nor did she know what the companies' contracts allowed them to do, although she said visible advertising was not included. **********But, she said, \"Interflora is looking at having an order for flowers placed from space.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/world/salvadoran-assembly-to-take-up-charter-changes.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1991-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadoran Assembly to Take Up Charter Changes", "print_headline": "Salvadoran Assembly to Take Up Charter Changes", "body_text": " **********Despite the delay in agreeing on a cease-fire in the decade-long civil war, the search for peace in El Salvador should advance slightly this week with the introduction into the Legislative Assembly of a package of proposed constitutional changes. **********Leaders of the main political parties are expected to return from Mexico City, where peace talks are being held, and introduce agreed-upon changes on Thursday affecting the role of the armed forces, the judicial system and expansion of the elections commission.

In turn, the guerrillas took the cease-fire proposal off the table. **********On the touchiest point -- how to reform and reduce the size and power of the armed forces -- officials and politicians say there is agreement on almost every aspect except whether to allow the armed forces themselves to have a representative on the five-member commission to be created to purge undesirable officers. **********While the constitutional changes to be introduced include a general philosophical statement reducing the armed forces' vast overall influence, more specific military questions, including the makeup of the purge commission, will remain on the table for the continued Government-guerrilla talks. **********The guerrillas, in their regular radio broadcast this morning, accused President Alfredo Cristiani of having caved into pressures and threats from far-rightist elements in his own Arena party in rejecting the proposal of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to revise the rules for amending the Constitution. **********But Ernesto Altschul, vice minister of the presidency, a post similar to deputy chief of staff for Mr. Cristiani, asserted that the guerrilla group had intended to take advantage of the proposed rule changes to open a \"permanent political campaign\" on any constitutional amendments it wanted to propose from the time it lays down arms until the next elections, in 1994. **********He explained that this would have been possible because the proposed revisions would have made it possible to change the Constitution with action in just one session of the Assembly, plus a referendum. Mr. Altschul said the guerrillas, who have no chance to win Assembly seats until 1994, had hoped to create a political platform for themselves in the meantime through the amendment mechanism. **********\"The F.M.L.N. knows that if they can't find a way to campaign politically between 1991 and 1994 the votes they receive in 1994 will be minimal,\" he said. **********\"So we resisted,\" he added. \"We said we want a clear debate now over what should be changed in the Constitution.\" **********The present constitutional reform rules have no provisions for a referendum but require that the amendment be approved by two successive Legislative Assemblies. The next few days, however, represent an opportunity to get changes approved quickly because the current Assembly comes to an end on Tuesday and the new one, whose members were elected in March, will be seated the next day, May 1. **********This explains the hurry by political parties, including Arena and the opposition Christian Democrats, to introduce the changes on which they have agreed. It is not clear whether Democratic Convergence, the leftist coalition with ties to the guerrillas, will support the package.

Warner, though, can release a record only if Mr. Simon is satisfied with the concert's quality. **********There is a precedent for success, however. The album that Mr. Simon recorded with his former partner, Art Garfunkel, when they reunited for a Central Park concert nearly a decade ago, was a hit for Warner Records, selling more than four million copies.  Home Video a Possibility **********Time Warner's home-video company may also release a video of the concert, if Mr. Simon approves. And while home-video sales of such concerts are rarely best sellers, the fact that the Central Park event will already have appeared on HBO would be of intrinisic promotional value to sales of any resultant video or record. **********Beyond that, Warner International can also license replays of the concert overseas and already has an agreement to do so in Germany. **********After a Madison Square Garden concert on March 17, Mr. Simon came up with the idea of a free Central Park concert. He spoke to a public relations man, Dan Klores, who in turn called the city's Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gottbaum. Together with the concert producer, Ron Delsener, they went to see Mrs. Gottbaum, who detailed the city's requirements. **********To raise the necessary funds, Mr. Simon then spoke to Time Warner's chairman, Steven J.

The panel's recommendation makes it very likely the F.D.A. will approve Centocor's drug, known as Centoxin, for sale within a few months, he said. **********But Dr. Patrick J. Scannon, Xoma's president, said the company was stunned by the panel's decision, adding that analysts were overreacting to its comment about the data on its drug. He said the F.D.A. merely needed more time to analyze test results. \"I feel very strongly that once they see the complete analysis, things will move right along,\" Dr. Scannon said.  The Battle Turns Sour **********The immediate future of the small biotechnology companies rides on these drugs, and the fight has gotten nasty, involving lawsuits and scientific mudslinging. The stocks of both companies have fluctuated recently, as analysts have tried to guess which company would come out ahead. Centocor's stock surged $3 today, to $40.50, while Xoma's plunged $5, to $15.50.

The so-called gram negative bacteria release toxins into the blood that can cause septic shock, a condition in which the patient's temperature rises and body organs fail. **********The drugs are monoclonal antibodies, bioengineered versions of the proteins that the body uses to fight infections. The antibodies are designed to home in on the toxins in the blood and neutralize them. **********Physicians say that regardless of which company benefits from today's endorsement, the development of the drugs is a milestone. \"It is of major potential significance,\" said Dr. Roger C. Bone, the chairman of the department of medicine at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. **********But the approval of the Centocor drug, which is expected to sell for more than $3,000 a treatment, is also likely to pose questions for doctors and for a health-care system struggling to control rising costs. **********That is because the studies to date show that Centoxin can reduce the death rate in a small segment of the patients treated, but it is hard to identify those patients in advance. **********\"You have a problem in overuse of a potentially very expensive medication,\" said Dr. Bone. **********Indeed, the F.D.A. panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, made up of medical experts from universities and hospitals, seemed to think that Centoxin's label should include certain restrictions to be determined by the F.D.A. on its use, said Teena Lerner, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York. **********\"I'd classify it as a kind of muted victory,\" Ms. Lerner said, adding that \"it wasn't a ringing endorsement\" of Centoxin.  A Critical Problem **********The primary problem, Dr. Bone said, is that there are 500,000 to 600,000 cases of sepsis, a condition of high fever and organ misfunction that could be caused by infection. But only about 200,000 of the cases are caused by gram negative bacteria, and not all of those cases involve bacteria in the blood, the condition for which Centocor's drug is useful, he said. **********Yet because the infections can be so dangerous, doctors may use the drug on any patient suspected of having such an infection. That would result in overuse, Dr. Bone said. But waiting one to three days for test results to see if the infection is caused by gram negative bacteria would be risky. **********Most analysts had favored Centocor's drug over Xoma's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/04/business/construction-spending-up-0.8-in-april.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 453, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Construction Spending Up 0.8% in April", "print_headline": "Construction Spending Up 0.8% in April", "body_text": " **********Spending on new construction projects rose eight-tenths of a percent in April from March, the largest gain in 14 months, the Commerce Department said today. **********Analysts said the strong rise was a sign that some parts of the building industry might be climbing out of the economic doldrums. **********The spending rise -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $392.6 billion -- followed a revised 2.1 percent drop in March. April's rise was the strongest gain since March 1990, when spending went up by 2.2 percent. **********The improvement was concentrated, however, coming in nonresidential building like industrial plants, offices and commercial projects. Residential construction spending was down in the month, as were taxpayer-financed projects like road building.

Reverse buyouts have been among the most profitable deals on Wall Street in the last year, with the total dollar volume of offerings rising to $4.6 billion so far this year, from $583.3 million last year, according to IDD Information Services. **********So the first signs of wariness for these deals is attracting a lot of attention. Wall Street's growing angst is focused largely on the troubles in the Nov. 22 initial public offering of Stop & Shop Holdings Inc., a company taken private in 1988 by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. **********Initial offerings earlier this year of companies owned by Kohlberg, Kravis, the New York buyout firm, have proved to be some of the year's best deals for investors and the companies, too. For example, Duracell International, which came to market in May, performed like many reverse leveraged buyouts brought to market this year: The new shares came to market, and soared in price in the first day of trading. That kind of performance persuaded numerous debt-laden companies that the time had come to go public, and they rushed to market. **********But the performance of Stop & Shop underscored a growing queasiness among investors. While the 17 million shares in the company had been expected to be priced at at least $14 according to the initial filings, they were actually priced at $12.50 a share. They closed at that price on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. **********The impact of the disappointment with Stop & Shop have been quick. Reverse leveraged buyouts \"will probably keep getting done, but they aren't all going to be slam-dunks anymore,\" one investment banker said yesterday. Another market professional added, \"The window is closing on the effusive buying attitude\" for initial public offerings of highly leveraged companies. **********Already, Wall Street has begun adjusting its plans. Of the four planned reverse leveraged buyouts that had filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, three -- Almac's Supermarkets, Multi Local Media Information and Unifax -- have postponed their offerings, according to IDD. The one going ahead is Owens-Illinois Inc., another company owned by Kohlberg, Kravis; it is scheduled to be offered this week in a deal underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Several Wall Street executives said the troubles with the reverse leveraged buyout offerings were largely a result of the troubled conditions in the market. The 120-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average shocked investors, making new offerings less enticing and pushing money managers to the sidelines. \"The economy, coupled with the pragmatism of year-end portfolio tidying-up, as well as a 120-point drop in the Dow, says, 'Hey, we are taking a breather for while,' \" said Michael D. Madden, co-head of investment banking at Lehman Brothers. **********The track record of the reverse leveraged buyouts that have come to market in the last year indicates that investors were growing wary before the Dow plunged. On Nov. 14, the day before the drop, fully 37.5 percent of the companies that issued shares this year in reverse leveraged buyouts had seen the value of their stock drop -- sometimes as much as 50 percent. **********But since the market drop and the decline of consumer confidence, the number of companies doing reverse leveraged buyouts this year that saw their stocks drop increased only slightly, by 1.7 percent, to 39.2 percent of all reverse leveraged buyouts this year. **********And the companies that declined included some that had been considered sure investments. Ann Taylor Stores, which went public earlier this year with great success, only to be followed by turmoil at the company, dropped by more than 32 percent in value from the first day of trading until the day before the market plunge, falling from $26.875, to $18.25. That decline has grown only worse since then, with the stock closing at $13.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. **********The meaning? With shares in more than one-third of the reverse leveraged buyouts having suffered losses in their first months of trading, Wall Streeters say, a conservatism is creeping into the marketplace that makes a repeat of the huge successes of earlier this year unlikely. **********But, with corporations weighed down by the debt taken on in the 1980's, few expect a less-enthusiastic market to hold back reverse leveraged buyouts for long. **********\"There is a strong desire out there among corporate decision makers to de-leverage,\" said Tom Davis, the head of equity transactions at Merrill Lynch & Company. \"It's a secular trend that will be with us for the next few years.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/14/business/us-nearer-farm-accord-with-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1991-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 529, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Nearer Farm Accord With Europe", "print_headline": "U.S. Nearer Farm Accord With Europe", "body_text": " **********American and European Community officials said today that they were approaching a compromise on reducing subsidies to farmers -- a major stumbling block in global trade talks -- but that some obstacles remained. **********Negotiations picked up steam after President Bush met with European Community leaders last weekend, the officials said, and both sides have adopted more conciliatory positions.

'Everything Would Be Destroyed' **********The Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology said the fissure appeared to be a precursor of an \"avalanche\" of molten rock and ash. **********\"The possibility of this avalanche is very, very high,\" said Glenda Besana, a geologist with the institute. \"Everything would be destroyed in its path -- trees, houses, everything.\" **********The largest of the cities affected by the evacuation order was Angeles, a city of 300,000. Reports from the area spoke of a huge traffic jam as those not already frightened away by the volcano, 15 miles distant, packed their belongings and fled. **********The last 900 Americans guarding Clark Air Base, one of the largest American military installations outside the United States, were evacuated earlier in the day. The base is adjacent to Angeles and slightly closer to the volcano than the city. The Pentagon said earlier in the week that 3,300 tons of munitions were stored at the now-unguarded base, but that the eruption posed little danger to the weapons. Officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark. **********Also affected by the evacuation order were the cities of San Fernando and Olongapo, which are on the edge of the 25-mile zone. Olongapo, the larger of the two cities, has a population of 200,000. **********Officials at the United States Navy base at Subic Bay, next to Olongapo, announced no evacuation plans. Since the eruption began last Sunday, the naval base has been plagued by electricity and water shortages caused by volcanic ash that settled in the machinery of local utility systems. **********On Monday, nearly 14,000 of the 16,000 Americans living or working at Clark were evacuated south to Subic Bay, which is itself home to about 16,000 Americans. **********In a tacit admission that Clark would not be able to resume normal operations for months, if not years, the United States Embassy in Manila announced today that thousands of the evacuees would be sent home to the United States.  Dozens Reported Trapped **********\"Continuing volcanic activity, uncertainty over how long the danger will last and severe overcrowding at Subic naval base combined to necessitate the removal, which will take place over the next few weeks,\" the embassy said in a statement. **********The biggest single loss of life from the eruption was reported from Angeles, where the roof of a bus terminal in the city collapsed under the weight of rain, ash and falling mud. An Angeles hospital reported that two people were killed, but radio reporters said that only 12 of about 100 people believed to have been in the terminal had been pulled from the rubble. The station appealed to disaster officials to send medical crews and acetylene torches to free trapped victims. **********About 85,000 Americans and Filipinos have fled their homes in the central Philippines since Mount Pinatubo returned to life last weekend, more than six centuries after its last major eruption. **********Most of the Americans evacuees have sought shelter in overcrowded housing compounds at the Subic Bay naval base. **********But military officials say that with Subic itself under siege from the volcano, the former residents of Clark will have to be moved out of the Philippines as quickly as possible. **********\"Our resources are stretched to the limit,\" said an American official in Manila. \"We've got to start moving these people out of the country and get them back home. We don't have room for them. God knows when we'll get back Clark in operation again.' **********The American lease on the Clark and Subic bases expires in September, and American officials have said that the volcano will clearly have an impact on the final rounds of negotiations with the Philippine Government over a renewal of the lease."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/10/business/company-news-2-gm-divisions-expand-incentives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 G.M.

Indeed, although Mr. Tartikoff said last week that \"someone with vision could still have impact,\" he added that \"they would have to have the resources and support I got.\" **********When Mr. Tartikoff took charge of NBC's programming in January 1980, the only limits on his prospects were his own creative abilities. **********Now, Mr. Tartikoff said, the job is defined by its limits. These include limited ratings expectations because of all the new channels competing for viewers; limited margin for error because of the diminished network reach; limited patience from new corporate managers with no broadcasting background, and limited profits, leading to limited budgets. No Longer a Shock **********\"Think about this,\" Mr. Tartikoff said in a telephone interview from his NBC office in Burbank, Calif. \"In my first year as president of entertainment, NBC had only $48 million in profits. That was considered shocking, that a network could be that close to breaking even. Now it is commonplace to think that two networks could get through a year and not make any money.\" **********Indeed, CBS lost money last year and expects to post a loss for the current television year. **********The changes have mainly to do with two factors, Mr. Tartikoff said: the \"power shift\" away from the networks and the overall economics of the business. **********The television landscape has been reconfigured in the last decade, he said. \"In 1980, cable had not hit criticial mass; neither had VCR's. There was no Fox network.\" **********The last decade saw the emergence of cable stations like the ESPN sports channel and Turner Network Television as the percentage of households with cable television roughly tripled to about 60 percent. In addition, syndicated programs proliferated on independent broadcast stations.  'Last Colossus of Programming' **********Even in the less-crowded television arena of 1980, Mr. Tartikoff was not an overnight success. **********\"Tartikoff was the last colossus of programming,\" a senior industry executive said. \"That's gone forever. There's no patience left in the business. Brandon had two and a half rough years. Nobody could afford to be that patient with a program executive now.\" **********Indeed, NBC's slide in the ratings grew so steep between Mr. Tartikoff's first season and 1983 that managers for NBC's affiliated stations pressed for him to be discharged. But Grant Tinker, then NBC's chairman, had complete faith in Mr. Tartikoff's talent and complete patience with the difficult situation he was then facing. Mr. Tinker shrugged off the complaints of the affiliates. **********Mr. Tartikoff said, \"I had Grant Tinker supporting me and Fred Silverman teaching me.\" Mr. Silverman had been the original giant of network programming, having pushed first CBS and then ABC to the top of the ratings before he became corporate president of NBC. **********But that quality of talent is not evident at the networks today. Instead, Mr. Tartikoff said, \"The networks have all these numbers-crunchers considering how to save money by cutting back on the network service in prime time.\" He added, \"That was unheard of 10 years ago.\" **********So was putting on programs purely because they are cheap to produce, as the networks do now with the spate of so-called reality shows moving into prime time. \"Does the world really need 'True Detective' and 'American Detective' in the same season?\" Mr. Tartikoff asked. **********With programs now costing so much more to produce, some formats are all but closed to programmers, he said. **********\"Nobody makes 'The A-Team' anymore,\" Mr. Tartikoff said. \"Nobody makes action-adventure anymore because it costs too much and it doesn't sell in syndication. Producers don't want to do an hour show for you anymore. The diversity is not what it used to be.\" Best Writers and Producers **********Mr. Tartikoff revived NBC's fortunes in the 1980's by recruiting the best writing and producing talent, and giving them good time periods and plenty of time to make a program work. **********\"That strategy is commonplace now, too,\" Mr. Tartikoff said. And it has helped drive the costs up. The best writer-producers -- like Steven Bochco (\"Hill Street Blues,\" \"L.A. Law\") and James Brooks (\"The Simpsons\") -- now make long-term expensive deals, which include commitments for shows to get on the air. **********\"People get commitments for three or five series on the air,\" Mr. Tartikoff said. He noted that Linda Bloodworth, the writer of \"Designing Women,\" received five commitments from CBS. **********\"She's good, but that means she's crowding out somebody else,\" he said. \"Maybe she's going to crowd out the next Steven Bochco from getting an opportunity on your schedule. ABC has made a lot of these commitments. They are almost in the position we found ourselves in at NBC when we had all this heavy-hitting talent lined up. You start locking yourself in, and then you start cutting loose other talented people.\" New Economic Realities **********Later this month, Mr. Tartikoff will give a speech that lays out his strategy for dealing with the new economic realities facing television programmers. \"We can't keep doing business the way we did 10 years ago,\" he said. \"Instead of letting the corporate bean-counters come up with ideas like cutting the budget for developing series by 20 percent, we have to start asking ourselves if we can do the same programming job with 10 people instead of 30.\" **********Mr. Tartikoff said he would have moved NBC in that direction if he had stayed. Last year, he said he hoped that before he left the network, he would have restored NBC to dominance in the 1990's as he had in the 1980's, retiring \"undefeated.\" **********\"I guess I'm not quite going out like Sandy Koufax,\" he said last week. \"This is more like Koufax going out with a 15-14 season.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/16/business/ibm-net-fell-84.5-in-3d-period.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1991-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

The company's work force has now declined by about 50,000 since it peaked at 406,000 in 1985.

Earnings were $172 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $1.11 billion, or $1.95, in the 1990 period. **********A number of analysts said they still saw signs for concern based on continued pressures from price competition and the recession. **********Rick Martin of Prudential Securities said he was cutting his estimate for the fourth quarter based on an unexpected decline in gross margins on equipment. He said he estimated that gross margins were probably no better than 47 or 47.5 percent for the quarter compared with an expected 55 percent. He said he spoke to the company yesterday and was told that I.B.M. expects margins to only partly return at the end of the year. 'A Nasty Situation' **********\"It's really a nasty situation,\" he said. \"I think that Wall Street earnings estimates are going to trail off during the quarter.\" **********He said he attributed the margin decline to pricing pressures, underuse of capacity during the recession and the effect of product introductions, which slow initial sales. **********The company appears to be making a strong transition to its new line of mainframes, several analysts said. I.B.M. began shipping its new family of top-of-the-line processors last month, and its strength in the fourth quarter is largely dependent on the success of the new machines. But a number of questions remain on price issues analysts said. If the company is forced to offer deep discounts to sell its new machines, which are for the largest corporations, it will subtract significantly from fourth-quarter earnings. **********\"The big question is price,\" Mr. Milunovich said. Aggressive Offerings **********Separately, I.B.M. told analysts in a telephone conference call that it believed its market share in the personal computer market would hold for the year, after a decline in the first half. Several analysts said that the company would show a number of aggressive desktop offerings shortly and that it expected its new machines to make up ground that it had lost recently to clone companies like Dell Computer and Zeos. **********During the morning conference call the company said United States sales continued to decline during the quarter, but that the decline was slower than the previous quarter. As a result the company said that the economy might have bottomed out and that it expected an improving economy in the fourth quarter. **********I.B.M. also said sales of mainframes, computer storage devices and low-end personal computers had declined so far this year on a year-to-year basis, while its AS-400 minicomputer and RS/6000 work station lines had shown increases. **********The company also said its European business declined compared with the second quarter of 1991."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/22/world/jordanians-agree-to-join-in-talks-on-mideast-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1328, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JORDANIANS AGREE TO JOIN IN TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE", "print_headline": "JORDANIANS AGREE TO JOIN IN TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE", "body_text": " **********Jordan joined Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia today in agreeing to attend a regional peace conference proposed by the United States.

American officials said that Mr. Baker, without actually showing Mr. Shamir the Assad letter, had briefed him both on its contents and on the side assurances that the United States had provided the Syrians. What U.S. Would Do for Syria **********Those side assurances mostly involve restatements of American policy: that the United States does not recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights; that it believes that United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, calling on Israel to exchange land for peace, applies to the Golan Heights as well as to the West Bank, and that the United States is committed to pushing any peace negotiations actively, so as not to allow delays. **********Mr. Shamir asked Mr. Baker for more time to consider the matter, and the two men will be meeting again on Monday. \"We are not under any pressure to give an answer soon,\" the Prime Minister's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said. \"The problem is content, not deadlines.\" **********Before Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir, he held talks with three West Bank Palestinian leaders, led by Faisal al-Husseini, and made it clear to them that they, too, had to make some hard decisions. American officials said it was a tough, and at times emotional, encounter in which the Palestinians were essentially told that as the weakest party in the equation, they would have to accept previously unpalatable political realities. **********One of those is that the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasir Arafat, can have no direct involvement with their delegation to the peace conference, since that would prompt the Israelis to walk out immediately. **********The other is that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem can take part in the first stage of the negotiations. The Israelis have ruled this out, arguing that such a role would imply that East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed, was negotiable. **********But it is possible that the second restriction might be finessed if there is a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and Palestinians born in Jerusalem take part with Jordanian passports. **********Despite those restrictions, the Palestinian leaders were told that they would soon have to come up with a list of acceptable representatives, American officials said. **********An intriguing thing about the endorsements that Mr. Baker has won from the Arab countries is that the Arab leaders all say in public that they are ready to accept Mr. Bush's proposal to attend \"a peace conference\" to reach a \"comprehensive solution\" based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. But none of them ever mentions that this conference is intended as a ceremonial opening event for direct Arab-Israeli talks. **********American officials insist that the Arab leaders have privately assured them that they understand this, but do not now want to say it publicly for fear of alienating their own hard-liners. Each one, instead, allows Mr. Baker to say it for him. **********Thus, when reporters asked King Hussein today if he would say in public that he was committed to direct talks with Israel, he was not pleased. **********Looking a bit flummoxed, the King replied, \"This is about the most ridiculous question I have ever heard.\" **********If it is so simple, the reporters persisted, why not give just a simple answer? **********\"What do you attend a conference to do?\" the King retorted. \"To mime? To make faces at each other, or to discuss and try to resolve the problem? I have been calling for this for years and years. I assure you that this is really the intention, and it is very, very clear.\" **********As the journalists continued to press the King to say the words \"direct bilateral talks with Israel,\" he declared the news conference over and walked out with Mr. Baker.                    --------------------       BUSH REITERATES VIEW **********ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, suggested once again today that Israel should be flexible for the sake of peace in the Middle East and halt settlement building on the West Bank. **********\"The question of settlements has been important,\" Mr. Bush said, in response to a reporter's question at a meeting here today with Turkish opposition leaders. \"I haven't encountered anybody in this part of the world that thinks increasing settlements is a helpful thing. And the United States policy has been opposed to it for years.\" **********The President also said he did not want to use a \"volatile\" word like pressure in talking about his stance with the Israelis. He preferred to call it \"reasoning and taking this -- what I keep calling a new credibility for the United States in the Middle East -- and using that to encourage what is a very reasonable and important step to peace.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/07/world/france-cautions-lebanon-general.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1991-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 683, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRANCE CAUTIONS LEBANON GENERAL", "print_headline": "FRANCE CAUTIONS LEBANON GENERAL", "body_text": " **********As Michel Aoun, the exiled Christian general who battled the Lebanese Government for two years, stepped up his calls for rebellion in Beirut, France warned him today to tone down his language to prevent French-Lebanese relations from worsening. **********In an unusual statement, the French Foreign Ministry publicly warned General Aoun that his inflammatory remarks risked breaching an agreement in which the Lebanese Government allowed him to seek asylum in France on condition that he refrain from political activity. **********The Government's warning came just hours after a French magazine published an interview in which General Aoun said that within the next year the Lebanese people would rebel and oust Syrian forces from their country. **********The general, who was spirited out of Lebanon a week ago to a heavily guarded villa in Marseilles, said that his stay in France was just temporary and that he would someday return to liberate his country.  'I Remain a Symbol' **********\"I remain a symbol,\" said the 56-year-old general, who headed an anti-Syrian interim Government for two years. \"It's not false modesty to say I am, and I will be the liberator of my country.\" **********In an interview published today in Paris-Match, a weekly magazine, he added, \"Within 12 months, the Lebanese people will rise up and throw out Syrian and other foreign forces, before organizing free elections.\" **********General Aoun's remarks have angered the Lebanese Government and risk fraying relations between Lebanon and France. The Beirut Government has protested to France about the remarks and demanded that French officials stop the general from making what the Government of President Elias Hrawi views as calls to rebellion. **********At a news briefing today, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman, Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, said: \"He undertook certain commitments in accepting asylum in France. We are upholding our commitments. General Aoun has to uphold his commitments.\"  Spent 10 Months in Embassy **********Before arriving in France, the general spent 10 months in refuge at the French Embassy in Beirut after Mr. Hrawi asked Syrian forces to flush him out of his bunker at the presidential palace in Baabda, a suburb of Beirut. **********After intense negotiations between France and Lebanon, the Beirut Government granted General Aoun amnesty and allowed him to leave so long as he not return for five years or engage in political activity. Beirut had accused him of embezzling millions of dollars, but in today's interview the general said such charges were baseless. **********Speaking about his 10 months in the French Embassy, he said, \"In my gilded cage in the French Embassy, I felt freer than President Hrawi, who has to go to Syria every week to report in.\" **********\"I do not consider myself in exile -- I am simply on a trip,\" he added. \"I have only two suitcases, which I have not even unpacked.\" **********Paris-Match also quoted him as saying, \"If I am in exile, then the Lebanese people are in exile in their own land since the country is occupied by foreign forces, and liberty and democracy do not exist.\"  French Envoy Is Summoned **********On Tuesday, An Nahar, a Beirut newspaper, published remarks by General Aoun urging a rebellion against President Hrawi and his Syrian allies. In response, the Lebanese Foreign Ministry summoned the French Ambassador, Daniel Husson, on Thursday to demand that France stop him from breaching the amnesty greement. **********Quoting diplomats, the Beirut press reported Thursday that France had instructed the general to exercise political restraint in public so as not to damage to French-Lebanese relations. **********General Aoun said the statements quoted Tuesday came from remarks he made to visitors to Marseilles who later relayed them to the newspaper. He has also told supporters that he does not consider himself bound by the amnesty accord because he does not recognize Lebanon's Government as legitimate. **********In March 1989, General Aoun began a six-month battle to push Syrian forces out of Lebanon. He later spurned a peace plan brokered by the Arab League, and he continued fighting not only the Syrians but also a rival Christian militia that supported the accord. That agreement, approved by the Lebanese Parliament, gave Muslims a greater role in the Government and legitimized Syria's troop presence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/business/canada-beer-and-asia-tools-target-of-us-import-curbs.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1991-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Beer and Asia Tools Target of U.S. Import Curbs", "print_headline": "Canada Beer and Asia Tools Target of U.S. Import Curbs", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration said today that it planned to impose duties on Canadian beer to retaliate for Canada's restrictions on American beer. And it said it would extend some restrictions on imports of tools from Taiwan and Japan used to make machinery, including military equipment. **********The move against Canadian beer could result in a doubling of the price of imported brands like Molson, Labatt and Moosehead next April, when the duties are scheduled to go into effect, although continuing negotiations could lead to smaller duties or no duties at all. **********The tool restrictions would retain five-year-old caps on imports from Taiwan and Japan that were initially imposed because of the Reagan Administration's reluctance to have the United States become dependent on foreign equipment for the American military buildup. **********Coming three days before President Bush's trip to Asia, on which he will press Japan to pull down its trade barriers, the two announcements this afternoon appeared to represent a shift in Administration policy, trade experts said. **********\"Taking machine tools and Canadian beer on the same day adds up to a get-tough stand on trade policy,\" said Gary C. Hufbauer, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. **********The two decisions are likely to mean that the Administration will extend similar import restrictions on steel and impose permanent duties on imports of Canadian softwoods next spring, he added. **********But the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, who announced the machine-tool decision today, avoided presenting that action as a move toward protectionism. **********\"The main responsibility for achieving international competitiveness rests with the industry itself,\" he said. **********The announcement today to prepare sanctions on Canadian beer imports, which was made by the deputy United States trade representative, Julius L. Katz, reflected American frustration with six years of efforts to open up Canada's beer market. Quebec province, for example, has 11,000 grocery stores licensed to sell domestically brewed beer but only 300 stores are licensed to sell American beer. **********The Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which sets rules for international trade, issued rulings disapproving of the Canadian beer restrictions in 1988 and again this year, but has not required removal of the limits, which are set and maintained by each province. The GATT ruling this year only requires Canada to file reports next March and July on any changes in its policies. **********The Canadian Embassy here objected to the American announcement, adding that it planned to comply with the GATT ruling. **********\"Canada has told the U.S. that retaliation is premature and inappropriate,\" said Pam K. Chappell, an embassy official. Suit by U.S. Companies **********Two American brewers, The G. Heileman Brewing Company and the Stroh Brewery Company, filed a legal case against their Canadian rivals in 1990 that forced the Office of the United States Trade Representative to announce by Sunday whether it was prepared to impose duties. **********The exact amount of the duties on the $150 million a year of Canadian beer imported into the United States will depend on a planned Government study to determine the value of sales now lost unfairly by American brewers. **********If the Government study finds that American losses exceed $150 million, the Administration will seek to eliminate Canadian beers from the American market by charging a prohibitive tariff that could exceed 100 percent of the wholesale price, said an American trade official who insisted on anonymity. People would presumably stop buying Canadian beer if it rose to $10 or more a six-pack. Partial Duty Possible **********If the study found that losses were less than $150 million, the Administration could either impose prohibitive duties for part of each year or a moderate duty all year, the trade official added. The United States currently charges a duty of 1.2 cents a liter, or about 2 1/2 cents a six-pack, for Canadian beer, and this is scheduled to fall by 25 percent next year because of the free trade agreement with Canada. **********Today's decision on machine tools was particularly hard fought within the Administration because it involves both trade and national security issues at a time when American officials are groping toward new policies after the collapse of the Soviet Union. **********The Office of the Trade Representative and some White House officials had argued that continued restrictions could not be justified on purely economic grounds because of the industry's success in competing against some imports. The Defense Department, however, successfully argued that national security required President Bush to extend some of the restrictions, which are actually imposed by the exporting countries under American pressure as so-called voluntary restraint agreements.  From Cars to Submarines **********Machine tools are used to cut and grind the metal parts for everything from cars to bombs and nuclear submarines. Some members of Congress had joined the Defense Department in warning that the United States could not afford to depend on imported tools lest the supply be cut off. **********Free-traders in the White House and elsewhere in the Administration had contended that the war in the Persian Gulf and the Soviet Union's collapse had made it unlikely that the United States would again fight a war long enough to require the mobilization of the American economy. **********President Bush ordered today that import restrictions on machining centers and computer-controlled machines that punch, shear, round and mill metal be extended for two years, although the caps are to be gradually lifted during that time. But import restrictions on similar machines without computer controls will be allowed to expire next Tuesday. **********The Coordination Council for North American Affairs, which represents Taiwan in the United States, said the American decision unfairly penalized Taiwan. The decision keeps imports at 1986 levels, when Taiwan's industry was still small."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-nab-names-new-president.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "N.A.B.

Boone Pickens is a power player. Win Smith, senior vice president at Merrill Lynch, is a stress fighter. Barbara Feigin, director of strategic services at Grey Advertising, is a fun worshiper. **********\"Vacations are like behavioral Rorschach tests,\" said Dr. Howard Glazer, a psychologist at New York Hospital. **********Ever alert for an opportunity to draw back the curtain of ignorance, the Hyatt Hotels Corporation decided to ask executives how they spend their vacations. Then it hired Dr. Glazer to fit executives seeking relaxation into a series of pigeonholes. **********Voila! The signs over the slots read: power players, stress fighters, schedulers, fun worshipers and fugitives. By exercising the columnist's prerogative, a sixth category can be added: cheaters. **********The survey was done by Research & Forecasts Inc., a New York polling firm. It involved telephone interviews with 500 executives from around the country, who stay at least half the time in non-Hyatt hotels. The survey found that executives take an average of four vacations annually, most lasting less than a week. Once rid of office stress, 91 percent of executives said they become friendlier, 72 percent more athletic and 65 percent sexually freer. It takes 42 percent of executives two to four days to unwind and find their particular pigeonhole. **********Dr. Glazer calls the categories \"archetypes\" and bases them on demographic data, including age, income level, gender and industry. \"It shocked us that there were such distinct types of people who conformed to such different vacation patterns,\" said Darryl Hartley-Leonard, Hyatt's president. **********Well, maybe. The first group, the power players, is largely composed of C.E.O.'s, presidents and company owners. These people supposedly make the smoothest transition from work to vacation and back again.  \"Doing business helps them to relax,\" said Nicholas Tortorello, chairman of Research & Forecasts. \"They don't see it as agony or pain in any way.\" He cites Mr. Pickens, a former client, as a perfect example. \"I've been with him on vacation, when he'll sit by the pool talking on a portable phone to his office. He's always cool, calm and collected, no matter where he is.\" **********Likewise, Mr. Hartley-Leonard, a C.E.O. to the core, prides himself on being a power player. \"For years my wife has told me it's ridiculous to spend an hour working each morning when I'm on vacation,\" he said.  \"But I need my fix in order to feel comfortable.\" **********The stress fighters spend their vacations frantically exercising and dieting. \"These are the people you see up at 6 A.M. in jogging clothes, the ones who are always carrying a bottle of mineral water,\" said Mr. Tortorello.  \"They're on a mission, not a vacation.\" Stress fighters rarely enjoy traveling to foreign cities; they usually opt for state-of-the-art spas or rigorous nature treks. **********Five years ago, Mr. Smith of Merrill Lynch, a veteran marathon runner, joined Arthur Levitt, former head of the American Stock Exchange, on an Outward Bound trip; since then, he's ventured into the wilderness annually. This summer, he went rafting down the San Juan River and mountain biking in Moab, Utah. \"I can't stand lying around on the beach,\" he said. **********The schedulers like to structure vacations as heavily as work. \"These are the ones who end up on a tour bus,\" said Mr. Tortorello.  \"They're a bit manic about scheduling every moment. They're deathly afraid of getting somewhere and having nothing to do.\" He notes that schedulers are unlikely to be in frequent contact with their offices: \"They want to be constantly stimulated so they don't have to think about what they left behind.\" **********The fun worshipers enjoy exercise, but aren't ascetics like the stress fighters. They plan in advance, but they aren't control freaks like the schedulers. They're similar to the power players, with one notable difference: they avoid the office entirely. **********Ms. Feigin of Grey Advertising took her 21-year-old twin sons to a beach resort in Los Angeles this summer. \"I wanted to be in a pretty place, with good things to eat and plenty of sun,\" she said. \"I didn't want anything frenetic.\" While Ms. Feigin refrained from taking work with her, she did ask that her mail be sent on the last day of vacation so she could read it on the plane coming home. **********The fugitives use vacation as an escape. On the lam from stressful jobs, they abandon their inhibitions and party all night. Ever been to Club Med? The fugitives are the ones drinking pina coladas for breakfast. \"Despite their relative success, they're plagued with insecurity,\" Dr. Glazer said. \"They're usually in industries like investment banking where you can make big bucks at a young age and end up over your head. They're typical baby boomers, who can't stop worrying about their careers and their money.\" **********But the Hyatt study left out one possible group, the cheaters. These are executives who think they're taking vacations but aren't. Harold Geneen bragged about all the time he took off while running the ITT Corporation. In fact, most of his \"vacations\" involved inviting business associates to ITT's fishing camp in Florida or the company's hunting lodge in Georgia. **********\"A lot of people think they're taking vacations when they're going to seminars or conferences,\" said Earl Goldman, who runs his own insurance agency in Concord, Calif.  \"It's not a real vacation if you're with your colleagues or your customers.\" **********Mr. Goldman is not a cheater or a power player. Each year, he takes at least six weeks off and refuses to bring any work, to read any business periodicals or to contact his office.  \"I give them my itinerary, and tell them to call me only if somebody dies,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/02/world/bush-gives-praise-to-kuwait-after-meeting-with-the-emir.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Gives Praise to Kuwait After Meeting With the Emir", "print_headline": "Bush Gives Praise to Kuwait After Meeting With the Emir", "body_text": " **********After meeting with the Emir of Kuwait, President Bush today praised \"Kuwait's great progress in reconstruction, physical and political,\" despite charges by human rights groups that abuses are rampant, including torture and arbitrary detention. **********After their third meeting since the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug. 2, 1990, Mr. Bush and the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, issued a demand that Iraq unconditionally release all Kuwaiti citizens who have been held by the Baghdad Government since the war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/21/business/other-phone-failures-hurt-air-control.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1991-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Other Phone Failures Hurt Air Control", "print_headline": "Other Phone Failures Hurt Air Control", "body_text": " **********Major telephone failures that significantly degrade air traffic control services are far more common than is generally recognized, according to data released today by a Congressional subcommittee. **********Although few of them were noticed by the public, there were 114 episodes of \"major\" telephone failures that disrupted air traffic control in the year beginning in August 1990, the data showed. **********Ten of the failures affected air traffic controllers in the New York area, and 15 of them in the Washington area, the data showed. **********The information, compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, indicated that the outages lasted an average of about six hours. **********It is rare for a telephone failure to have as severe an effect on air traffic as the one on Tuesday night, when a power failure at an A.T.& T. center in Manhattan caused all air service in and out of the New York metropolitan area to be halted for several hours, stranding tens of thousands of passengers. **********But the F.A.A. has long identified such failures as one of its most pressing problems, and has been seeking to overhaul its nationwide telecommunications network and to make improvements on a spot basis throughout the system. **********The compilation defined major phone failures as \"those having significant operational impact, including air traffic delays, increased air traffic workload and safety concerns.\" **********The F.A.A. data were provided this week to the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which requested the material after this week's failure.

With war raging in the Persian Gulf, many large corporations have banned travel to the Middle East and greatly curtailed other international travel, officials of several dozen top companies said. **********At many companies, permission for international trips deemed essential for business must come from senior-level executives. Domestic travel has apparently not been affected. **********Many companies \"have either limited travel, banned travel to Europe or banned travel outright,\" said John Riepe of the National Business Travel Association, an association of corporate travel managers based in Arlington, Va. Bans at G.M. and 3M **********\"Prior to the outbreak of conflict, we had implemented a ban on international travel,\" said Thomas Pyden, a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation in Detroit. \"That has remained in effect.\" **********The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, in St. Paul, eliminated European travel in early January, and broadened the ban after war broke out on Jan. 17. \"All international travel has effectively been curtailed,\" said Mark Fenner of 3M. **********Companies said they had restricted travel because they were concerned about the safety of employees. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has encouraged his followers to commit acts of terrorism against the interests of the United States and its allies. **********Some large companies, however, have simply urged employees to be careful. \"We have advised employees to use extreme caution and common sense, but we don't have any travel bans,\" said Jack Batty, a spokesman for the General Electric Company in Fairfield, Conn. **********A survey conducted last week by the Carlson Travel Group, one of the nation's largest travel agencies, found international travel bans at 25 percent of the companies surveyed. \"Travel today is much more the exception than the rule,\" said Dexter Koehl, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based agency. He said the other companies had restricted international travel, allowing trips only with approval from the highest corporate level. **********Carlson Travel surveyed travel managers at 20 corporations. It also interviewed the managers of 20 of its own travel agencies. **********The curtailing of travel goes beyond safety concerns, Mr. Koehl said. Senior executives \"are very concerned about liability\" if an employee is injured or killed traveling on business, he said. **********At the Chrysler Corporation, for example, which has scaled back international travel sharply, responsibility for approving trips abroad has been kicked upstairs to the company's senior management, said Thomas Houston, a company spokesman.  Reduced Demand for Flights **********The shutdown of corporate travel has dealt another blow to the troubled airline industry. Trans World Airlines, for example, plans to cancel up to half of its overseas flights because of the drop in traffic. **********At United Air Lines, \"we have seen a softening in demand for international seats,\" said Sara Dornacker, a spokeswoman in Chicago. \"We attribute this to a temporary suspension of travel by business travelers to international destinations.\" United has not cut flights because of the reduced demand, she said. **********Traffic to Europe is also down for American Airlines. In a typical January, American's flights to Europe are nearly 60 percent full. Since the war broke out, the trans-Atlantic flights are only about 40 percent full, said Lise Olson, a spokeswoman for American. **********\"We have received reports from companies that have canceled business meetings in Europe,\" she said.  Scrutinizing Travel Costs **********While employee safety is the paramount concern, the travel bans come at an opportune time for corporations already scrutinizing travel costs in light of the weakening economy. **********Several companies surveyed by Carlson Travel spend more than $100 million a year on travel. **********Mr. Riepe of the National Business Travel Association said American companies spent more than $30 billion a year on travel. **********The price of jet fuel doubled after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, and airlines raised the price of tickets three times. As a result, even before the war and the threat of terrorism, the sharp increase in travel costs in a soft economy had caused a number of companies to curtail travel. **********\"This just makes the decision to stay put a little easier,\" said Mr. Houston of Chyrsler.  Alternatives to Travel **********For safety reasons, the International Business Machines Corporation is trying to avoid all travel to sensitive areas and is suggesting that employees use teleconferences or video conferences to avoid trips, said Rita Black, a spokeswoman.

This accounts for nearly 60 percent of the 93 million households with television sets. **********The officials complained that although their constituents looked to them to insure efficent cable operations at reassonable costs to consumers, \"under the current statutory framework, we lack the authority to address many of these complaints.\" The officials lost this authority under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. **********The local officials requested an end to current procedures, which they said favored the cable operators' ability to renew franchises. The localofficials want a totally competitive renewal process that allows municipalities to grant franchises to whomever they wish. Most franchises are renewable in 10 to 20 years. **********The officials also seek to restrict the cable operators' ability to sue municipalities. **********James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association, said the officials were seeking to enhance their power at the expense of consumers. \"They want to be able periodically to hold an auction for the franchise and get each contestant, including the incumbent, to engage in a contest of promises,\" Mr. Mooney said. \"That would have the effect of increasing the company's costs, which have to be passed on to the subscribers.\" **********Mr. Mooney said the officials actually wanted to restrict competition, a charge the mayors' groups rejected.

Still, in a July 31 ruling, the Federal Communications Commission noted what it regarded as abuses of municipal authority in franchising the cable operators. **********In a ruling on competition in the cable industry, the F.C.C. said, \"We recommend that Congress amend the Cable Act to forbid local franchise authorities from unreasonably denying a franchise to applicants that are ready and able to provide service.\" **********It added, \"Congress should also make it clear that local authorities may not pass rules whose intent or effect is to create unreasonable barriers to the entry of potential competing\" cable operators. **********\"Franchise requirements should be limited to appropriate governmental interests,\" the F.C.C. said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/world/rival-cambodian-forces-accept-cease-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rival Cambodian Forces Accept Cease-Fire", "print_headline": "Rival Cambodian Forces Accept Cease-Fire", "body_text": " **********Prince Norodom Sihanouk's guerrilla army said its field commanders had been ordered to respect a temporary cease-fire in Cambodia starting on Wednesday. **********All combatants have now said they will honor the truce.

As a result, Freddie Mac's handling of this scandal is being watched by a Congress increasingly skeptical of the agency's ability to monitor its own affairs. **********An investigation conducted over the last several weeks by Freddie Mac found that the 18 dealers had lied to the agency to gain a larger share of the agency's debt underwritings. The fine, imposed late Thursday night, was made equal to 20 percent of the commissions paid to the group in the sale of some $3 billion in securiites in the last two years. A total of 25 banks and Wall Street firms sell the agency's debt, which is used to finance home mortgages. **********A similar investigation is taking place at the Federal National Mortgage Association, called Fannie Mae, where many of the 55 dealers that sell Fannie Mae securities, which are also used to finance housing, admitted to inflated orders.

Mr. Jeffers would not say when that might be. **********In a statement, the Public Securities Association, which represents the dealers, said the 24-hour deadline for the payment of the fine was \"not a reasonable amount of time.\" The association said almost all of the members of the selling group had met in New York to discuss a course of action. **********Joseph Sims, an association spokesman, said he had no idea how many firms might ultimately pay the fine and added that the group felt the 24-hour deadline was a dangerous precedent that did allow enough time to analyze the situation. **********Cheryl Regan, a spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, said the agency agreed to an extension since \"we're trying to work things out with our dealers and it was a practicality.\" Firms, however, that do not \"indicate an intent to comply\" by Monday morning would be expelled from sales beginning that day. **********Freddie Mac would not identify the 17 firms, nor indicate the size of the penalty Salomon agreed to pay. In a statement, Salomon, which has admitted to submitting false bids in Treasury auctions, said it was paying the fine to maintain continued participation in the sales. **********There was speculation on Wall Street today that the 17 dealers might refuse to pay in a show of strength that would force Freddie Mac to sell its securities through only a handful of dealers. Proponents of this view pointed out that the fines were extremely small and that the issue was one of principle.

Most of what is known about the Prince comes from his advisers and his own account, rendered during the few times he has spoken with the press.  Started With a $15,000 Loan **********By their version, he started in business in Riyadh in 1979 after receiving a degree in business administration from Menlo College in Atherton, Calif. His start-up capital was $15,000 he borrowed from his father, Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz. He quickly exhausted that money and, when his father refused to bankroll him further, went to the local branch of Citibank. **********At first, Citibank was also reluctant, but agreed to a loan when the young Prince put up his home as collateral. His fledgling enterprise, Kingdom Establishment for Trading and Contracting, grew and expanded remarkably in a variety of fields including real estate, construction, travel and finance. In 1988, Forbes magazine estimated that Prince Waleed, at 33, had a net worth of \"at least $1 billion,\" making him perhaps one of the dozen richest members of the royal family. Yet in its 1990 tabulation of the world's billionaires, Forbes did not mention Prince Waleed. **********But some Saudi experts expressed doubts yesterday about the notion that Prince Waleed was a self-made billionaire whose money for the Citicorp move came entirely from his own coffers. One adviser to the Saudi royal family -- an extended tribe with roughly 20,000 members and 4,000 princes and princesses -- said it seemed unlikely Prince Waleed could have made so much money during the 1980's, when oil prices were depressed for several years, which slowed the Saudi economy. **********Instead, the adviser and an Arab banker, both of whom asked not to be identified, said the American-educated Prince probably had some help from his father, Prince Talal, a Saudi businessman of established wealth. **********Prince Talal was a Saudi Government official who, like some of his countrymen, became enamored of the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser's message of pan-Arab nationalism in the late 1950's -- an ideology opposed by the monarchy of Saudi Arabia. Prince Talal moved to Egypt in the early 1960's but later became disenchanted with Mr. Nasser. By the late 1960's, he had moved back to his homeland, but the Saudi rulers would not allow him to rejoin the Government. So he went into business. Favorable Terms for the Saudis **********Middle Eastern finance experts said the big Saudi investment in Citicorp was probably not directly related to the gulf war or championed by the Riyadh Government. The fall in the price of the shares of big American banks since the war and the recession began, however, made it possible for the Saudis to make a large investment on more favorable terms. **********Prince Waleed's investment, they said, mirrored the optimism of most Middle East investors about the long-range prospects for the United States economy. \"He undoubtedly views this an an investment in a premier bank in a country that still has tremendous potential -- that's got to be the principal motivation,\" said Sharif Ghalib, a Middle East expert at the Institute of International Finance in Washington. \"And there's no question that that is how gulf investors view the United States.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/15/business/axa-backtracks-on-equitable-life-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1991-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Axa Backtracks on Equitable Life Stake", "print_headline": "Axa Backtracks on Equitable Life Stake", "body_text": " **********Groupe Axa, one of France's largest insurance companies, announced today that it had reached an agreement with the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States to obtain a major stake in the troubled New York-based insurer. **********But later in the day the company backed off from the remarks saying that a definitive agreement had not been worked out. **********In a meeting with French stock analysts this morning, Claude Bebear, Axa's chairman, announced that there was an agreement but declined to say what size of a stake Axa would obtain in Equitable. He said the Paris-based company would be \"the uncontestable lead shareholder\" in what is the third-largest insurance company in the United States, after the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Equitable manages $140 billion in funds **********Mr. Bebear (pronounced bay-bay-are) stressed however that his company's agreement with Equitable required approval from the New York State Insurance Department. **********\"We have agreed with the Equitable people on a plan, but it must be approved by the department,\" Mr. Bebear said. \"We're in talks at the moment.\" He declined to predict the outcome of those discussions. **********Later in the day Axa retreated from the remarks that Mr. Bebear had made, with a company spokesman saying that there was no definitive agreement between the companies. \"Friendly conversations are being pursued between Axa and Equitable,\" the spokesman said. \"We cannot yet speak about an agreement.\" **********Analysts suggested that Axa was backing off because the insurance department might be concerned that the agreement was announced before it had been approved. In addition, analysts say, the department might ask for changes in the agreement that one of the parties might find unacceptable. **********A spokeswoman for Equitable declined to comment on the state of the talks, although Equitable officials have confirmed that Axa was one of the potential investors in the discussions. \"We are highly optimistic about our current discussions,\" the spokeswoman said. **********In recent weeks, Equitable officials have said that they are seeking investors to put up $1 billion to shore up the company's capital base, which has been greatly weakened by soured investments in \"junk bonds\" and real estate. Equitable officials said that in return for the $1 billion, the investors would receive a 40 percent stake. **********This morning, Mr. Bebear said Axa would be part of a group of investors that would pump about $1 billion into Equitable, and he added that Japanese and American investors might take part. \"There are also some Japanese companies that are very interested, and we're also talking to some United States investors,\" he said.   Japanese Talks Acknowledged **********Equitable officials had acknowledged that they were talking to two large Japanese insurance companies, Meiji Mutual Life and Nippon Life, but Mr. Bebear declined to say whether those companies would join the investor group. **********Equitable is seeking outside investors as part of an effort to transform itself from a mutual company owned by policyholders into a shareholder-owned company whose stock is traded publicly. **********Axa, which is Europe's eight-largest insurance company, had $9.4 billion in premiums last year and $306 million in profits from its insurance operations.   Management Called 'Imprudent' **********Mr. Bebear said today that an \"imprudent\" management team had gotten Equitable into trouble, but he added that they had been replaced by capable people. In an interview last month, Mr. Bebear said that in Axa's past foreign acquistions, it had retained most of the top managers because they knew the local market. He indicated that he would likely do the same at Equitable. **********Analysts say Mr. Bebear may have had to promise to retain Equitable's management as a condition for Equitable's choosing Axa as a major investor. \"I don't think Axa is going to put in any new management over there,\" said Simon Rudolph, an insurance industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in London. \"I would have thought it only natural that Axa would want to have considerable day-to-day information and control of what's going on. If they don't have, that would certainly surprise me.\"  Previous Effort Failed **********Two years ago, Axa failed in its efforts to acquire Farmers Group Inc., a large California-based insurer, when a foreign raider's attempt to take over Farmers' parent failed. Farmers is owned by B.A.T. Industries, a London-based conglomerate that repelled a takeover effort by a group led by Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French industrialist. **********Speaking about Equitable, Mr. Bebear said, \"We're convinced that we can perform an operation that will be very pleasing to our investors.\" **********Mr. Rudolph, the analyst, said that in view of Equitable's serious financial problems, Mr. Bebear was pursuing a high-risk strategy. **********\"Perhaps he knows something we don't know,\" Mr. Rudolph added. \"He must have gone into Equitable's books.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/23/world/salvadoran-talks-tackle-roadblock.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1991-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 792, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADORAN TALKS TACKLE ROADBLOCK", "print_headline": "SALVADORAN TALKS TACKLE ROADBLOCK", "body_text": " **********President Alfredo F.

A number of accords already have been reached on the issues of human rights and political and military reform in El Salvador. **********But what a United Nations mediator, Alvaro de Soto, called the \"crunch issue\" -- the concern of the guerrillas for their personal security after the fighting stops -- became the roadblock to a complete settlement. **********At the urging of the United States and the Soviet Union, Mr. Perez de Cuellar invited both sides to New York a week ago and has been holding daily sessions with them. Mr. Cristiani and the rebels have not met face to face, but some rebels and members of the President's Cabinet have met as a working commission. **********Diplomats said a major effort was being made to persuade the guerrilla leaders to accept the police role instead of a military function. 'Friends' Join Negotiations **********They said this diplomatic effort was being accompanied by a commitment to the guerrillas that a broad-based \"political mechanism\" would be created to help carry out the peace agreements, particularly those involving reform of the armed forces and the security of the former guerrillas. **********Such a group would have representation from the Government, army, guerrillas, church and political parties and would be closely linked to the United Nations peace verification mission that recently set up operations in El Salvador. **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar discussed this plan with the guerrilla leaders at a session Saturday night at which the United Nations Ambassadors from Spain, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela arrived to help argue the case. **********Those four countries united in June as the \"group of friends\" of the Salvadoran peace effort and have since been in regular contact with all those involved and with the State Department. American officials have praised their work. **********At the time they formed the group, the leaders of the four countries issued a declaration asking the two sides in the Salvadoran negotiations not to introduce elements not previously on the agenda. The Government claimed that was what the guerrillas were doing when they brought up putting some of their people in the army. Cristiani Under Pressure **********For a number of years the guerrilla leaders have claimed that the only way to end the war in El Salvador is to merge what they call the \"two armies\" -- their forces and the Government's. But the Government contends the rebels did not make that a negotiating point until a few months ago, when they began to speak of their need for \"participation\" in the army, which the guerrillas said amounted to less than their earlier merger proposal. **********Without using figures, the guerrillas said they wanted to move some of their people into the army at all levels, including officers, and to take part in the selection and training of future cadets. Government officials said this plan still amounted to a merger, by another name, and said the only way former guerrillas could get into the army would be by applying to become cadets. **********Mr. Cristiani is believed to have been under intense pressure from his army not to give any ground on this point, and diplomats working on the negotiations said that left little room to maneuver in trying to draft a plan acceptable to the guerrillas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/31/business/key-rates-945091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/02/world/cali-s-mayor-escapes-ambush.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cali's Mayor Escapes Ambush", "print_headline": "Cali's Mayor Escapes Ambush", "body_text": " **********The mayor of Cali, German Villegas, escaped an ambush by leftist rebels, but at least three of his bodyguards were killed and his brother was wounded, the police said today.

But he promised that with the bipartisan budget agreement in place, the deficit would be \"virtually eliminated\" by 1995. **********Mr. Bush said the Administration would also try to spur economic growth by scaling back on \"counter-productive\" Government regulations, providing incentives to promote private savings and \"job-creating investments\" and putting Federal money into education, public works and space technology. **********Asked about whether the so-called peace dividend that had been hoped for as the Cold War with the Soviet Union ended could still materialize, the President said defense spending was reduced in the budget he submitted to Congress this week. But he joked that he had been brought up to believe that dividends were paid out of profits, and he noted: \"We're operating at a three-hundred-and-some-jillion-dollar deficit, so we're not in exactly a dividend-paying mode.\" **********The President voiced optimism that the stalled Uruguay round of trade talks would be concluded successfully but he added that both Japan and Germany \"have got to give us access to markets.\" He said he hoped that a victory in the gulf would add to the United States' credibility in those talks and perhaps make Japan and Germany more willing to compromise.  Must Avoid Extreme Measures **********In his speech the President also somewhat defensively continued to reject suggestions, heightened since the war, that he propose conservation measures and strategies to make the country less dependent on foreign oil. **********\"Some will argue that reducing our energy vulnerability is not enough, and that we should embark upon more drastic measures designed to achieve total energy independence,\" he said. \"The reality is that we are a long way from total energy independence. We must avoid unwise and extreme measures that would seriously hurt American consumers, American jobs and American industries.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/world/british-envoy-warns-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Envoy Warns Lebanon", "print_headline": "British Envoy Warns Lebanon", "body_text": " **********A senior British diplomat, Douglas Hogg, warned Lebanon today that it had little hope of receiving Western aid as long as kidnappers in the country continued to hold Western hostages.

The northern desert is very rocky, too, taking its toll on self-propelled weapons and vehicles. **********The pervasive powder finds its way into weapons, engines and the computers that direct modern warfare, making soldiers and technicians increase maintenance and bringing worries that performance could deteriorate the longer the equipment needs to be used in the desert. **********\"It's a nuisance we can do without,\" Sgt. 1st Class Surender Kotnakota, who is in charge of maintenance for a forward battalion, told pool reporters. \"It requires a lot of extra effort to keep things clean. Long term, it could be a serious problem.\" **********Air filters on trucks must be changed every other day, rather than every 30,000 miles, he said. M-16 rifles, the infantry standard issue, must be stripped and cleaned daily. The ammunition magazines of M-16's have jammed from clogging by sand. **********Against regulations, soldiers are wrapping undershirts around their rifles to protect moving parts. A budding desert fashion of wrapping a scarf around one's head, knotted in the back, is also being discouraged by officers as \"Rambo-like.\" The fine sand has clogged the Army's vehicle transmissions and fuel filters, and rocks have punctured tires. **********Earlier, when troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia, sand began eroding the leading edges of helicopter rotor blades, but the problem was solved by taping the edges with epoxy. **********In the north, where the sand is finer and rises more easily, the epoxy tape must be changed after several hours of flying time. The powdery sand is sucked into helicopter engines. **********\"For now, they are performing well,\" said Lieut. Col. Bill Tucker, the commander of an Army battalion of Apache helicopters used to hunt tanks, adding: **********\"It's going to have an effect. You can't put a time or date on it. It wears out moving parts of the engines. The sand collects inside the engine, causes it to get hotter and therefore doesn't produce as much power.\"  Seder Amid Islam **********The religious practices of the American and other Western troops is a very sensitive subject in Saudi Arabia, where the royal family's political legitimacy rests on its claim to protect Muslim orthodoxy and King Fahd calls himself the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the most sacred Islamic shrines, in Mecca and Medina. Although the Baathist Government of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, is officially secular, his propaganda has played on the theme of an aggrieved Islam, threatened by the West and the Jewish state of Israel. **********Nevertheless, kits with materials for the Jewish festival of Passover quietly arrived here this week and are to be distributed in time for the celebration late next month, an Army Protestant chaplain, the Rev. Marc Coker, told pool reporters. **********The kits contain material for the tradtional seder meal, including matzoh, or unleavened bread, and copies of the Haggadah, the book of seder prayers and readings.  Golf in the Gulf **********Just outside the gate of the largest United States air base in Saudi Arabia lies the new pride and joy of Lieut. Col. Mike Townsend, an F-16 fighter-bomber pilot: the nine-hole Desert Fox National golf course he laid out between missons over Iraq and occupied Kuwait. **********Golf in the gulf, of course, has its own hazards. **********Players pick up a doormat-sized piece of Astroturf from Colonel Townsend's tent on the way to the course. After teeing up on it, they carry it around to serve as a patch of fairway for the rest of their approach shots. The whole course is sand. **********\"It's a par three, so if you're a good golfer, you can hit the green with one drive from the Astroturf,\" said Chief Master Sgt. Jim Chumley of the South Carolina Air National Guard. \"If not, then you're in the sand trap. Wherever you hit the ball, you're in the sand trap.\" **********Since the entire course is sand, the actual traps are outlined with sandbags. But here, they are referred to as \"SAM traps,\" for surface-to-air missiles. The two toughest holes are called Mount Suribachi and Pork Chop Hill, named for the sites of grueling victories in World War II and Korea, on small hillocks covered with volcanic rock. The most common complaint is the need to clear the rocks off these holes. The course rules warn players to \"use caution for natural inhabitants,\" presumably referring to Bedouins and camels, but perhaps also to scorpions. **********Not surprisingly, the best score so far belongs to the base doctor.  A Grunt's Glossary **********Further notes from a grunt's glossary, the language of the soldiers in the field: **********L.P.C.'s, or leather personnel carriers: boots. **********Big Red: the desert sun. **********Bolo Badge: the Purple Heart medal given for wounds, especially if they were foolishly acquired. **********B.C.D.'s or Birth Control Devices: the extremely ugly military-issue spectacles. **********Ninja women: black-wrapped Saudi women. **********Echelons beyond reality: command decisions.

Any hope of saving the E's could go unfulfilled if hospitals are jammed with casualties. **********Asked what he would say if a patient he has just marked with an E asks him if he is going to make it, Dr. Tripp blinked and took a breath. **********\"I don't know what I will say,\" he replied finally. \"I don't know.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/23/world/turners-wife-taking-gift-the-child-hes-never-seen.html": {"writer_name": "Katherine Bishop", "pub_date": "1991-10-23", "snippet": "Four years and nine months after she first tied a yellow ribbon around an apricot tree in the front yard of her modest home here, Estelle Ronneburg, the mother of Jesse Turner, sat in the darkness before dawn today watching images of her only chil...", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turner's Wife Taking Gift: The Child He's Never Seen", "print_headline": "Turner's Wife Taking Gift: The Child He's Never Seen", "body_text": " **********Four years and nine months after she first tied a yellow ribbon around an apricot tree in the front yard of her modest home here, Estelle Ronneburg, the mother of Jesse Turner, sat in the darkness before dawn today watching images of her only child flickering on the television screen. **********\"Oh, it looks wonderful to see him,\" she said of her son, who was freed by his Lebanese captors on Monday. \"It makes it believable to me.\" **********Her joy and relief at the end of Mr. Turner's 1,731 days of captivity had remained bottled up all Monday by doubts that his release had in fact occurred. **********After the announcement from the United Nations that he was free, Mrs. Ronneburg and her son's wife, Badr Turner, allowed themselves enough belief to begin packing their bags to fly to meet him in Germany today.

Instead, the reaction verged on euphoria. **********Whether that reaction can last is likely to depend largely on the course of war news from Iraq. Yesterday, the markets treated Saddam Hussein as a proven loser, unable even to cause significant damage to Saudi oilfields. **********Such an evaluation is premature, as both President Bush and Prime Minister John Major of Britain emphasized, and as last night's explosions in Israel may have proved. But by the nature of financial markets, those who wait for sober reflection and more facts are left out of the game. **********That may be truer now than ever, with satellite communications making it easy to get much faster battle information. In 1815, Nathan Rothschild reaped enormous profits with advance word, via carrier pigeons, of the British victory at Waterloo; yesterday, everyone from Japanese currency traders to President Bush was getting information from the same television broadcasts. **********Some portion of yesterday's move in markets around the world -- no one can say how much -- came from buying by those who thought they had been playing it safe in advance of a war. Some institutional investors, having husbanded cash because they feared a collapse of prices, felt it necessary to jump into the markets to avoid being left behind. **********But those were not the only buyers. Fidelity reported that its discount brokerage business was double that of a normal day, and that buyers outnumbered sellers two to one. And there was panic buying by speculators who had bet on a price decline in the event of a war, and had to buy quickly to cut their losses. **********The market action provided a classic illustration of the ability of markets to confound forecasts, and of the danger of relying on consensus predictions of market movement. **********For months, as prices deteriorated in world stock markets after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the common expectation was that the start of shooting involving the United States would drive the prices of stocks and bonds down, while giving an immediate lift to quotes for the dollar, gold and oil. **********There was, in fact, a whiff of panic selling yesterday. Oil prices shot up in after-hours trading just after the first word of war, and in Japan, where stock trading began shortly after the attack, prices plunged quickly, and the Nikkei 225 index was soon down 1.5 percent for the day. **********But as word spread of the apparently overwhelming success of the bombing attacks, the market perceptions turned. Suddenly, the biggest risk to oil traders was of being caught with excess inventories as an oil glut -- brought on by the return of Iraqi and Kuwaiti production -- sent oil prices plunging. And that was good news for bonds, where prices soared, and bad news for the dollar and gold, both of which had attracted buyers as havens in times of crisis. **********As measured by stock prices, the wave of enthusiasm seemed to peak in New York in the morning, after propelling prices steadily up during the trading days in Japan and Europe. The Nikkei 225 ended Thursday with a gain of 4.5 percent -- a 6 percent swing in prices from the daily low. European markets opened higher, slipped a bit, then rose to new highs near their closing times. **********In New York, the initial wave of buying sent prices soaring in the opening minutes, but without much in the way of follow-through until late in the afternoon. **********The easiest way to bet for or against a big rise in stock prices is to play stock index futures, and it was there that the most intense speculation -- and short-covering -- took place yesterday morning. The March futures contracts on the Standard & Poor's 500 were delayed in opening by a circuit breaker meant to limit big moves. But when they did open they went wild, soaring 5.3 percent from the close the day before. **********That rise, pushing the contract from Wednesday's 318.50 to 335.00, came while the actual stock market was struggling to open many stocks amid cascades of buy orders. Because actual market indexes treat stocks that have not opened as still being at the prior day's prices, the reported figures for the actual indexes did not rise to such levels. **********But in fact, that was the high for the day. The futures contract fell to below 327 by late morning, then moved up gradually until spurting in late afternoon to close at 332. Such stocks as Eastman Kodak, Alcoa and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, all hit their highs for the day when they opened. **********That late afternoon rally, which propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a gain of 114.60 points, or 4.6 percent, to 2,623.52, reflected in part the plunges in gold, down $30 an ounce, and oil, down more than $10 a barrel, which continued through the day. It also reflected the new belief that it is a bigger risk to be left out of the stock market when good news arrives than to be in it when bad news comes. **********That sentiment was also shown by the fact that the futures contract closed well above the actual S.& P. 500, which ended the day at 327.97. **********\"People are deadly afraid to be left out of the market,\" said a trader for one major Wall Street firm as the day ended.

Riots broke out in half a dozen cities as the reports spread around the state. Local Government Decision **********At the same time, local government officials decided to close the university and send home its 18,000 students, 60 to 70 percent of whom are Muslims. **********At that point, Naseem Farooqi, an electronics engineer who recently became the university's vice chancellor, drew the line. **********\"This university has very high secular traditions,\" he said in an interview. **********\"There was no trouble in the university at all,\" he said. \"All around us, people were being pulled off trains and killed, pulled off buses and killed. My concern was, where do I send all these students? The local government does not have the power to close a university. That power rests with the vice chancellor and the central Government.\" **********On this procedural challenge, local officials backed down. But not before India's Government-run television network had broadcast an announcement that the university had been shut. Panicky parents called from all over India and abroad.

The assumption was that they were Hindus. This was a totally false story. We checked out every patient.\" Problems at Hospital **********At the hospital, Dr. S. Badrul Hasan, the medical superintendant, said problems are continuing. He quotes Indian Supreme Court decisions to support his appeal to the city administration to lift restrictions on his ambulances. In Aligarh, emergency services and hospital care have become segregated, and the wounded suffer. **********Dr. Hasan said he cannot respond to emergency calls -- many from Muslims, who are still the victims of random stabbings and shootings -- without local government permission. Hindus are going to the district government hospital. Dr. Hasan called in a limping ambulance driver who, he said, had been beaten by state police as he tried to pick up victims. **********'You just cannot assault an ambulance driver,\" Dr. Hasan said. \"You can stop him.

Although Cuban eye specialists had long agreed on the desirability of a visit by the flying hospital, a Government invitation failed to materialize, perhaps another reflection of Havana's reluctance to be seen as wanting in health. **********To expedite things, Mr. Foot enlisted the help of the former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who personally reached President Fidel Castro to promote the visit. **********With the Cuban invitation in hand, Mr. Foot said he called the State Department a month before the departure date to make a routine inquiry into travel security in Cuba and was told \"security is fine, but Treasury regulations won't allow you to go.\" Positive Aspects Highlighted **********The next month was spent wrangling with the Treasury Department, which, citing the potential monetary value of medical techniques, declined to give it a special exemption from the ban on economic exchanges with Havana. **********Finally, with quiet support from the State Department and a pledge to spend only monies raised by the foundation's offices in London and Hong Kong, the trip was approved. **********Once on the ground, Orbis doctors, perhaps sensing the delicacy of the situation, repeatedly highlighted the positive aspects of Cuban care, even as they privately noted some of its deficiencies. **********\"The cases presented to me would have been difficult ones in any clinic in the world,\" said Dr. Forrest Ellis, a pediatric ophthalmologist from the University of Indiana, after surgically correcting an eye muscle in a 6-year-old girl that his Cuban counterparts thought was congenitally absent. **********Cuban health-care professionals, who worked side by side with their American counterparts, seemed delighted by the exchange. **********\"Who cares who is the most sophisticated or the most advanced,\" said Anna Remon, a 40-year-old ophthalmological nurse who assisted in Dr. Ellis's operation. \"Our cooperation seems to have helped this little girl, and that is what matters.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/22/business/briefs-625091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt * First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, priced $100 million of senior notes, maturing in 1998, with a 9 3/8 percent coupon at 99.867, to yield 9.40 percent, through Kidder, Peabody. *********** Hillenbrand Industries of Bates, Ind., has filed for $100 million in 20-year debentures to be offered through Lehman Brothers.

The light reads: \"On the Air.\" **********The gulf war is proving to be exceptionally good television programming. Despite the ongoing decline in network audiences, people are watching this war. If they continue to watch news programs after it ends, the war may turn out to be a springboard for some long-term profits for the network news divisions. **********\"Nightline\" on ABC is the prototype of a network newscast that grew from crisis coverage into an established program. Born as a nightly recap of events after American hostages were seized in Iran in 1979 (and originally labled \"America Held Hostage\") \"Nightline\" quickly became an institution, generating both profits and enormous prestige for ABC News over the last decade. **********The \"Nightline\" precedent is clearly on the minds of some network news executives as they add programming to cover the gulf war. **********The war is costing each of the broadcast networks an average of about $1.5 million a week. Some days the price has run much higher, depending on how much satellite time the networks have to pay for. **********And the tab is still running. The prospect of a long war has sent shock waves through the network financial offices. The year has already been a dismal one as the networks struggle through a slump in advertising sales and a prime-time season without a new hit series. **********But the three networks -- as well as CNN -- have all realized substantial ratings gains for programs covering the war during its first 10 days. More significantly, some news programs that have been able to take advantage of the high interest in the war could eventually survive its end and thrive as ongoing profit centers. **********For CNN, the chance to capitalize on the war interest may come right away. The prime-time national ratings for CNN in the first week has ranged from 5 to 11.7. That is an enormous improvement over the average CNN prime-time rating of 0.7 (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) **********But each of the broadcast network news divisions has reason to hope to gain something as well from the intense interest in the gulf war. **********ABC hopes to continue the increasing superiority it exhibited in all of its news programs during the first week of the war. CBS hopes to capitalize on the improved recognition for its morning news program and the reprieve for its late-night news program, which was to be canceled. **********And NBC has the most to gain. If the network can successfully transfer the audience watching its news programs during the war into regular viewers after the war has ended, NBC could achieve a long-elusive goal: making its news division profitable. **********Both ABC News and CBS News were making money before the war, largely because of the amount of weekly programming those news divisions produce. NBC News has never been able to establish a successful prime-time series. **********But its latest effort, a half-hour Sunday night program called \"Expose,\" has gotten off to an auspicious start. Last week, the program had a 10.8 rating in a time period where NBC had trouble getting a 7 rating earlier this season. Part of the reason: \"Expose\" offered fresh reporting on the gulf war. **********This week, NBC News will begin a new daytime series, \"A Closer Look.\" Though the intention of the series is to run reports of interest to women, this week it will concentrate on war-related topics. If that helps the series establish itself, NBC News will have found another profitable outlet. **********Certainly, the main growth that NBC would like to see from the war coverage is a permanent extension of its evening newscast from half an hour to an hour. Even before the war began, NBC announced that it would expand its newscast to cover war-related stories. The network's executives openly hoped to find a way to make the expansion permanent. **********Local stations have long opposed any network news expansion because it would eat into their programming time. So realistically, NBC executives admit that a permanent hourlong newscast remains a long shot. But the longer newscast will be broadcast indefinitely as the war goes on. **********CBS has a more exact parallel to the \"Nightline\" precedent at work. The late-night CBS News program, \"America Tonight,\" was originally scheduled as a stopgap program to fill the 11:30 P.M. time period until the entertainment division had some action shows to put there. \"America Tonight\" was officially canceled just before the war started. **********But the network rescinded the cancellation to allow the news division more air time to cover the war. Now, \"America Tonight\" is thriving on its war coverage. Last week, in the overnight ratings for the country's 25 largest markets, the program was up a full ratings point, to 4.7, from the week before the war started. **********\"That sort of improvement augurs extremely well for this show,\" said Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group. He said the low cost of \"America Tonight\" would make it a \"major profit center with ratings like that.\" **********CBS is also encouraged by the higher ratings last week for \"CBS This Morning,\" which has long been the weakest of the network morning programs. **********ABC, however, has taken the most advantage of interest in war reports. The ABC evening newscast had its highest rating ever in the war's first week. And the ratings of \"Nightline,\" now an hourlong program, grew more than two ratings points. The ABC magazine program \"Prime Time Live\" was also up substantially in the ratings. **********If ABC holds on to a percentage of the additional viewers, it may be able to translate them into higher revenues -- as long as advertisers come out of the war more enthusisatic than when they entered it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/05/world/after-the-war-turkey-is-keeping-frontiers-closed.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1991-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 953, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TURKEY IS KEEPING FRONTIERS CLOSED", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; TURKEY IS KEEPING FRONTIERS CLOSED", "body_text": " **********Despite growing international and domestic pressure to let in a flood of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq, Turkey insisted today that it did not have the resources to deal with a mass migration and would keep its borders closed. **********While Turkish officials report that several hundred thousand Iraqi Kurds are trying to escape the Iraqi Army by fleeing into Turkey, fewer than 10,000 people were said to have managed to find sanctuary in a string of Turkish border towns about 200 miles east of this regional capital. **********The semi-official Anatolian News Agency reported that as many as 80,000 other Kurds were technically inside Turkish territory, but were right at the border and were being held there by security forces. **********\"We are taking measures to make mass entries more difficult,\" said Murat Sungar, chief spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Ankara. Aid Sent to Refugees **********Nevertheless, the Turks tried to maintain a flow of food, medicine and blankets for the refugees, in some instances by hauling material on mules because the roads could not support cars or trucks. Some aid was donated by Britain, France and the German Red Cross. **********In Hakkari, a border town about 300 miles east of Diyarbakir, at least 35 Kurds were reported to have undergone emergency surgery, including more than half a dozen who needed leg amputations after having stepped on land mines on their trek into Turkey as they fled revenge-minded troops of President Saddam Hussein who have recaptured northern zones from Kurdish rebels. **********\"This is a kind of genocide,\" President Turgut Ozal told the British network, ITN.

Former Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, leader of the opposition True Path Party, warned, \"Turkey cannot stay idle before Saddam's massacre.\"  Balancing on Fine Line **********Turkey is trying to keep its balance as it draws a fine line in its refusal to permit a wholesale influx of the Iraqi Kurds. **********On the one hand, Turkish officials acknowledge that the Kurds' situation is grave, and they recognize that they would be vulnerable to widespread condemnation if refugees were slaughtered by Iraqi troops while knocking vainly on Turkey's door. **********On the other hand, the Turks insist that they have neither the money nor the means to absorb so many displaced people all of a sudden, and they have asked the United Nations for help. Foreign Minister Ahmed Kurtcebe Alptemocin warned that a sudden migration of this magnitude would \"threaten our social and economic security.\" **********Mr. Ozal went even further in the British television interview, challenging Europe to take in refugees, too, instead of asking Turkey to shoulder the entire burden. **********\"I ask the European countries: You should take half, and I will get the other half,\" he said. \"Will you accept that?\"  1988 Experience Recalled **********Turkish officials are still bitter about their last experience with a large migration of Iraqi Kurds, in 1988, when more than 60,000 people poured into Turkey claiming that their villages had been attacked by Iraqi soldiers using chemical weapons. The Turks complained that Western Europe did little to help then, and instead rebuked Turkey repeatedly for supposedly not giving the refugees adequate shelter. Even Turkish human-rights campaigners, who normally are quick to protest the mistreatment of Turkish Kurds, criticized Europe for having been longer on talk than action in this matter. **********In the meantime, Turkey continues to shelter 27,000 of the 1988 refugees, who are housed at camps outside Diyarbakir and Kiziltepe, near the border with Syria. **********Bulent Akarcali, a member of Parliament from the governing Motherland Party, typified the Turkish resentment when he predicted that the next few months would go like this: **********\"Ankara will open its doors to the refugees. These refugees will say how much they love Turkey during their first week here. The West will also praise Turkey. Then the Council of Europe and many countries will start talking about poor conditions, and international organizations will ignore the issue and not help Turkey.\" **********In conversations with Turkish reporters, Foreign Ministry officials and military commanders accused Iraq of a campaign to push an unwanted ethnic group outside its borders. Some suggested that Iraqi leaders were also deliberately trying to put a strain on Turkey as revenge for Ankara's role in the anti-Iraq coalition during the Persian Gulf crisis. **********A respected daily newspaper, Milliyet, quoted an unidentified Cabinet minister as saying Turkey reserved the right to intervene militarily if the Iraqis continue to drive the Kurds to the border. Mr. Alptemocin said in Parliament on Wednesday that \"our southeastern frontier is under threat.\" **********\"There is mortar fire on those people coming from Iraq,\" he said. Some 20 shells dropped in our territory.\" **********Speaking with Turkish reporters, the Iraqi Ambassador in Ankara denied that his country had any intention of harming Turkey. But the Ambassador, Rafi Micvel el-Tikriti, said Iraqi forces were fully justified in pressing their campaign against the Kurds. \"Nobody should expect that we would offer a flower to our enemies,\" he said. **********Iran says that up to a million and a half Iraqi Kurds are headed its way. But that figure, like those offered by the Turks, is difficult to confirm. **********In the 1988 migration, initial estimates of refugees proved to be highly inflated, although the real numbers -- 60,000 in Turkey's case -- were large enough."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/22/business/regulators-are-faulted-in-problems-of-big-insurer.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 871, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Regulators Are Faulted in Problems of Big Insurer", "print_headline": "Regulators Are Faulted in Problems of Big Insurer", "body_text": " **********As California and New York officials try to assess the possible financial losses facing customers of the Executive Life Insurance Company, many government officials, analysts and consumer groups blame weak regulation for not preventing the insurer's financial problems. **********The insurance industry has historically been regulated by the states. Critics of the system say state regulators and legislators did little to rein in Executive Life as it amassed a huge portfolio of \"junk bonds.\" **********The critics say the Executive Life situation also exposes weaknesses in the system. They contend regulators and politicians in too many states are susceptible to lobbying by the industry. They also say the system facilitates the wishes of insurers more than it protects consumers and that regulators have been too willing to handle problems in private. New York Is Praised **********The criticism extends to most states, though New York is often cited as the state that did the most to crack down on Executive Life. California, the home of both Executive Life and its parent, the First Executive Corporation, is often singled out as the state that did the least. **********In a speech here last week, John Garamendi, who took office in January as California's first elected Insurance Commissioner, said that during the 1980's, California's Insurance Department \"just turned its back\" on First Executive. Mr. Garamendi has long been critical of Roxani Gillespie, who was California's appointed insurance commissioner through the latter half of the last decade. **********Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, a self-styled consumer advocacy group in Los Angeles, compared the performance of insurance regulators to that of savings and loan regulators in the years leading up to the crisis in that industry. **********\"And just as in the S.& L. debacle, the insurance regulators who were supposed to protect the public from this kind of disaster failed to do so,\" Mr. Rosenfield said. **********Current and past state regulators, including Ms. Gillespie, defended their approach, saying they had been taking steps to monitor First Executive closely for more than a year and that even today Executive Life has not technically been found insolvent. **********Regulators in California seized control of Executive Life this month because of the weakening condition of its junk bonds and a deluge of customers seeking to cash in policies, a process similar to a run on a bank. Last week, regulators in New York seized a smaller subsidiary, the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, for the same reasons. **********It remains unclear whether Executive Life's customers face losses. The New York subsidiary is considered to be in stronger condition, and New York regulators said they believed that none of the New York company's customers will have losses. Congressional Action **********Industry executives and analysts say they expect new Congressional hearings on the regulation of the insurance industry and that Federal oversight is a possibility. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, is drafting legislation that would give added power to Washington. **********Executive Life's demise is likely to hasten changes at the state level as well. **********Some states are likely to follow New York in developing tougher regulations. Starting in 1985, New York enacted a series of rules, including one limiting junk bond holdings, that allowed it to keep Executive Life of New York on a tight leash. **********Legislation was introduced in the California Assembly last year that would have limited an insurer's junk bond holdings to 20 percent of its assets -- the same as in New York. The measure failed after heavy lobbying by First Executive, despite the well-publicized troubles with the insurer's portfolio. Legislators say the prospects for tighter regulatory restrictions on junk bonds and other issues have improved. Trenton Tries Strong Steps **********State regulators have increasingly split over the best way to handle troubled insurers. Last fall, the New Jersey Insurance Department became concerned about Executive Life. Breaking with other state insurance departments, which had been urging low-key, coordinated action, New Jersey in December demanded that Executive Life put up a $500 million deposit to guarantee that it could pay all obligations to customers in the state. **********In an action that was widely criticized by consumer groups, The National Association of Insurance Commissioners promptly passed a resolution condemning New Jersey's action, stating that Executive Life and Executive Life of New York \"are in no imminent financial danger.\" **********New Jersey subsequently dropped its demand for the deposit in return for Executive Life's agreeing not to sell more policies in the state. **********Larry Gorski, an Illinois Insurance Department official who helped to draft the association's position on Executive Life, said the group's assessment was based on extensive studies of the insurer's finances and its ability to meet its obligations. **********But Joseph M. Belth, professor of insurance at Indiana University and editor of the Insurance Forum newsletter, said the regulators' association might have erred in failing to consider the sequence of events that eventually led to the seizure of Executive Life: that the possibility of the parent company's bankruptcy would lead to a surge in policy surrenders and withdrawals by customers of its operating subsidiaries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/23/business/role-of-taxes-debated-in-adding-to-income-gap.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shabecoff", "pub_date": "1991-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 627, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Role of Taxes Debated in Adding to Income Gap", "print_headline": "Role of Taxes Debated in Adding to Income Gap", "body_text": " **********Federal tax policy contributed to the widening gap between the wealth of rich and poor Americans in the 1980's, a group of experts told the Senate Budget Committee today, but they disagreed on how great a role other economic factors played in the inequity. **********There was near unanimity that, as the committee chairman, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, put it, the 80's were \"the decade when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.\" **********Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a coalition of labor, public interest and community groups, said \"huge tax breaks\" for wealthy Americans had stimulated \"gross overconsumption\" by that sector of society. At the same time, he said, lower-income families were facing increased tax burdens because Social Security taxes were raised and because states had to raise sales taxes and other taxes to make up for reduced Federal aid.  A Conservative Viewpoint **********A contrary view was expressed by Marvin H. Kosters, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research and policy group here. Mr. Kosters said tax policy might have had some effect on the distribution of income, but it was a relatively minor element. The chief factor for the change, he said, was the widening gap between the wages paid to skilled, educated workers and their unskilled, uneducated counterparts. **********An important way to close the gap, he said, would be to improve the education and training of unskilled workers. Tax policies that aim at redistributing income, he said, \"are more likely to impair human-capital investment and income growth.\" **********Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, said economic and demographic developments, including the declining demand for unskilled labor and the growing number of single-parent families, \"were far more important than direct Government policy in explaining the swelling incomes of the affluent and the shrinking wages of the less skilled.\"   The Role of Government **********But he added, \"Even if the role of Government was smaller than sometimes suggested in the press or Congress, I regard it as scandalous that Government policy should have played any role at all in making the matter worse.\" **********Mr. Burtless, too, urged that unskilled workers get more and better training and that schools provide more help to students who are not bound for college. **********He also said he thought the issue of income distribution should be directly addressed by reducing Government transfers of income to the wealthy, like Social Security and Medicare payments. He proposed taxing such benefits once they exceeded the payroll contributions made by the recipient.  Data on Average Family **********Senator Sasser said the net worth of the average American family, adjusted for inflation, declined by 3.4 percent between 1984 and 1988, while the richest 20 percent of households saw a 14 percent increase in wealth during the period. **********He also cited data showing that the real hourly earnings of the average worker had declined 4 percent since 1982. He added, \"That's 4 percent below the low point of the 1982 recession -- the deepest postwar recession we've seen.\" **********Mr. Sasser said the income disparity was reflected in tax trends during the decade. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, he said, pay a tax rate that is 9 percent below the rate paid 10 years ago because of \"the supply-side tax cuts of the 1980's.\" **********\"By contrast,\" he said, \"tax rates for 60 percent of Americans have increased.\" **********Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, expressed skepticism about the disparity of wealth in the United States, saying that the 1980's had been a time of general prosperity for the nation. **********\"If you torture numbers long enough they will tell you anything,\" he said, challenging the statistics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/17/business/credit-markets-treasuries-down-in-slow-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 614, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasuries Down in Slow Trading", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasuries Down in Slow Trading", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities moved lower at the end of a slow session yesterday, as dealers continued what has become a lengthy process of distributing notes and bonds purchased at last week's refunding auctions and digested reports that provided little new economic insight. **********A report showing that housing starts rose by 6.2 percent in April was counterbalanced by Labor Department data showing that initial unemployment claims rose slightly in the week that ended on May 4. **********\"The market got the kind of numbers it expected,\" said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. **********\"We have had a lot of numbers this week, and they haven't changed many minds,\" Mr. Johnson added. \"They say that, yes, there is a recovery coming, but it isn't going to be very snappy.\"  Looking to Next Auctions **********With little additional economic news expected for at least a week, dealers said the focus had turned to auctions next week of short- to intermediate-term notes. **********\"The big story right now is how the short end of the curve will do in the face of overwhelming supply,\" a government bond trader said. \"The market seems to imply that it can handle it, but it remains to be seen.\" **********With the target for the overnight Federal funds rate likely to stay at 5 3/4 percent, analysts said, there seems to be little reason to expect short-term interest rates to rise much. **********In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bills, the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 100 9/32 late yesterday, down by 2/32, to yield 6.84 percent.

Utilities and Interest Rates **********Are the utility stocks sounding a warning on interest rates? **********Since peaking a week ago yesterday at 220.89, the Dow Jones utility average has fallen 5.2 percent, to 209.51, arousing some concerns because its performance has been much worse than those of most other stock indexes. The Dow industrials have slipped 1.9 percent over the week, and the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 1.5 percent. **********Over time, the Dow utilities have gained a reputation as a forecaster of trends in interest rates. Utilities are vulnerable to those trends in two ways, because they borrow large sums of money and because their shares generally pay high dividends and are often bought by investors who might otherwise buy bonds. **********Over the same period, bond prices have dipped, but not by nearly as much. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds has risen to 8.26 percent, from 8.11 percent, amid fears that the Federal Reserve may not continue to ease credit aggressively. That move in rates cut the price of a long Treasury bond by about 1.6 percent, far less than the decline in utility stock prices. **********Among the 15 stocks in the Dow utilities average are several electric utilities whose prices have slipped about 5 percent each. Electric utility stocks are especially sensitive to interest rates. **********But for those still hoping for lower rates there may be pleasure in the fact that the biggest damage to the Dow utility average was done by natural gas stocks, whose profits were damaged by weak prices and a warm winter and whose performance has less relationship to interest-rate expectations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/13/business/company-news-ncr-stockholder-list-is-given-to-at-t.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1991-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 302, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCR Stockholder List Is Given to A.T.&T.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NCR Stockholder List Is Given to A.T.&T.", "body_text": " **********The NCR Corporation turned over a list of the names of most of its shareholders to A.T.& T. yesterday, compelled to do so by the ruling of a Federal appeals court in Manhattan in the telephone company's takeover battle for the computer maker. **********The list gives the American Telephone and Telegraph Company a way to reach individual NCR shareholders directly to try garner support for its $90-a-share cash offer. **********Mark Feighery, an NCR spokesman, said the company turned over the shareholder list after the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit lifted a stay of a lower court order requiring NCR to furnish its stockholder list to A.T.& T.

Three CBS war specials attracted more viewers than competing entertainment shows. **********Many advertising executives acknowledged that several of the companies they represented had decided to avoid war programming. They said the sponsors cited fears that their commercials might be juxtaposed with such images as dead or maimed soldiers. There is also a reluctance, they said, to place upbeat commercials for items like soups, sodas and cereals on programs about the war. **********Executives for NBC and ABC, who refused to be quoted by name, agreed that the lack of advertising on news programs was a serious financial problem. But they said it had not yet affected any programming decisions. **********The CBS executives said they had even offered advertisers assurances that the war specials could be tailored to provide better lead-ins to commercials. One way would be to insert the commercials after segments that were specially produced with upbeat images or messages about the war, like patriotic views from the home front. But, Mr. Lund said, \"we had no success.\" Fewer Prime-Time Specials **********As a result, \"you are absolutely going to see fewer of the prime-time news specials on CBS,\" he said. \"In fairness to our shareholders, we can't lose $1 million every time we do one of them, and we are losing an easy million between what we lose in ad revenue and the production costs.\" **********Mr. Lund said the reluctance of advertisers had even extended to regularly scheduled news programs like \"60 Minutes\" and \"48 Hours\" when they dealt heavily with war issues. **********Advertising executives said the tone of most commercials was vastly different from that of the war news. \"Commercials are full of music and happiness,\" said William Croasdale, a senior vice president of the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency. \"They have a lot of comedy in them.

A lot of them said they wanted us to get back to Gene Shalit's movie reviews and the other lighter stuff.\" **********Richard Dale, an executive at Deutsch Advertising, said some sponsors were reasonably concerned about juxtaposing the war and commercials. \"After a segment about a chemical attack that includes a shot of a disfigured face, it might not be the best time to talk about Oil of Olay skin care.\" he said. **********But Mr. Dale said that even for sponsors unconcerned about juxtaposed images, advertising in war news might be a mistake. \"I just think it's wasted money,\" he said. \"Commercials need to be seen in the right environment. A war is just not an upbeat environment.\" **********He also suggested that the weak advertising market was affecting the number of commercials on news programs. \"All these advertisers have been cutting back budgets,\" he said. **********Responding to the advertiser reluctance, CBS conducted a polls on reaction to the commercials on \"60 Minutes\" last Sunday. CBS asked viewers whether they recalled the ads and whether they thought the advertisers were being exploitative. **********David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of CBS research, said the study showed that viewers were watching news programs even more intently than normal programming and that the commercials in the programs were recalled far better than most. \"A large majority found the commercials in no way exploitative,\" Mr. Poltrack said. He added that some viewers even believed sponsors who supported programs on the war were \"doing a public service.\" Campbell Soup's Reaction **********Still, many sponsors remain nervous. The Campbell Soup Company, for example, has decided to \"minimize\" its commercials in news programs while the war continues, said Paul N. Mulcahy, Campbell's vice president of advertising. He said the decision was part of a trend among advertisers to \"stay away from programs involving heavy controversy.\" **********Mr. Croasdale of Backer Spielvogel Bates added: \"We applaud what the networks are doing, but this is sort of the same situation as we've seen with some controversial television movies. After that sort of broadcast, letters get written -- some very thoughtful letters -- and they don't go to the advertising division. They go to the C.E.O.

Clifford, a towering figure at the intersection of law and politics in the capital for nearly half a century, resigned today as the chairman of Washington's largest bank holding company, apparently under pressure from Federal regulators and the board of the bank he led for nine years. **********Federal regulators and investigators have said that First American Bankshares Inc. was secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a loosely regulated international banking concern that was seized last month after auditors reported that the bank had a complex past that included bribery, money laundering and bank fraud. **********Mr. Clifford's law partner and protege, Robert A. Altman, who was president of the First American Corporation, also resigned today. The corporation was one of several holding companies that form the First American group's intricate structure. Temporary Chairman Named **********For now, First American said Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former United States Attorney General and former general counsel of the International Business Machines Corporation, would serve as First American's chairman. **********Banking officials said the Federal Reserve Board and Charles McC. Mathias, the former Republican Senator from Maryland who is on First American's board, helped force the resignations that commenced the latest chapter in the B.C.C.I. saga and precipitated the dizzying decline of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman from their highly lucrative bank posts. **********Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have consistently insisted that they were unaware that B.C.C.I. held any controlling interest in First American. **********The resignations also crystallize how much Mr. Clifford's long relationship with First American and B.C.C.I. had tarnished his once-illustrious reputation in the twilight of his career as a lawyer, lobbyist, adviser to Democratic Presidents and an unchallenged symbol of rectitude in Washington. **********Mr. Clifford, who is 84 years old, represented the Arab-owned, Pakistani-run B.C.C.I. when it first tried to acquire American banks in the late 1970's. **********The crux of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman's problems is that law enforce- ors with B.C.C.I. money. If they were aware that B.C.C.I. controlled First American, and lied to regulators about it, they could be charged with fraud. **********Neither man has been formally accused of any wrongdoing. **********Last month, the Federal Reserve moved to fine B.C.C.I. a record $200 million for \"secret arrangements\" that allowed the foreign bank to acquire First American but were in violation of agreements with the Fed that barred B.C.C.I. from having any ownership interest in First American. Those commitments were made by Mr. Clifford. **********Mr. Mathias, who had taken a leading role in managing the bank earlier this year when the B.C.C.I. connection was first discovered by the Fed, took the leading role in demanding the ouster of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, banking officials said.  'The Fed Wanted Them Out' **********\"The Fed wanted them out,\" one official said, \"and Senator Mathias played the leading role.\" **********Mr. Mathias declined through a spokesman to discuss the specifics of how the resignations came about. **********Frank Mankiewicz, the bank's public relations counsel, disputed the assertion that the resignations of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman had been forced. Rather, he said, they had chosen on their own to resign for the good of the company. **********Mr. Katzenbach, the new chairman, is expected to attempt to extricate First American from B.C.C.I. and eventually to sell the bank to new owners. But those tasks will be complicated by the fact that B.C.C.I.'s shares in First American have been seized by foreign bank regulators and are tied up in court proceedings in London and New York. **********Mr. Katzenbach said in a statement that the Fed had tentatively endorsed a plan for a trust to be established holding First American shares. **********\"Constructive ownership of the bank will be in the trust,\" Mr. Mathias said. He added that the legal issues might take a long time to resolve and that the trust would allow the bank to continue operations until that occurred. **********An order freezing B.C.C.I.'s assets in the United States, including the First American holding, was extended last Friday by Federal Bankruptcy Judge James Garrity in New York. It would prevent the movement of any First American shares. But Harvey Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer representing a claim against B.C.C.I., said that if the Fed asked Judge Garrity to revise his order to permit such a transaction, it would likely be granted.  Three Inquiries Under Way **********The Fed, the District Attorney in Manhattan and a Federal grand jury here are investigating whether Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman knowingly misled regulators with their repeated assurances over the years that B.C.C.I. would not be involved with First American. **********Robert M. Morgenthau Jr., the District Attorney in Manhattan, is investigating because First American has a branch in New York. Law enforcement officials have said that one of his objects is to see whether B.C.C.I. used First American to launder money. **********In a statement issued late today, Michael Cherkasky, chief of the investigation division for District Attorney Morgenthau, said, \"We have been informed of the resignations, and they will not impact on our ongoing investigation.\" **********The officials said that Mr. Clifford had been interviewed extensively by New York City investigators, though he has not appeared before the New York grand jury. They said Mr. Altman had not yet been interviewed in New York.  Indictments in Manhattan **********So far, Mr. Morgenthau's investigation has yielded indictments against B.C.C.I. and two of its top executives for bribery, money laundering and fraud. The bank pleaded guilty in 1990 to money laundering charges in Tampa, Fla., and was fined $15 million. **********First American officials said that neither Mr. Clifford nor Mr. Altman had received any special compensation for their resignations. **********Over the years, Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman profited handsomely from their B.C.C.I. dealings. At one point, both men borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price of First American stock on highly favorable terms from B.C.C.I. **********But the action that raised the issue most profoundly of whether Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman knew of the B.C.C.I. role in First American was a series of stock transactions in 1988 in which the two made a profit of $10 million in less than two years. A secretive subsidiary of B.C.C.I. in the Cayman Islands subsidized a buyer who officials have said was a small-time money-lender who purchased most of the stock at three times the price paid by Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman. **********And B.C.C.I. is said to have made a $2.2 million commission on the deal.  Audit Earlier This Year **********An audit earlier this year showed that some First American shareholders used money from B.C.C.I. to buy their shares in First American in 1982 and never repaid the loans, making B.C.C.I. the secret owner. **********Throughout the year, Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman said they were unaware that B.C.C.I. held a controlling interest in First American. In June 1981, Mr. Clifford, relying on his reputation, assured Federal regulators that B.C.C.I. would have no role in First American, an assertion he repeated several times in the ensuing years. **********Mr. Clifford now contends that he was gulled by the founder and former head of B.C.C.I., Aga Hassan Abedi, a Pakistani who is at the center of the unfolding B.C.C.I. story. **********But investigators and Federal regulators have said there is much evidence that makes the claim that they were unaware of B.C.C.I.'s involvement less plausible. Dual Role as Lawyers **********Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, as lawyers, represented both B.C.C.I. and First American. The group of original stockholders in First American who were represented by the two lawyers were assembled by Mr. Abedi. **********In his statement of resignation today, Mr. Clifford said that First American \"has been operated honestly and without control from B.C.C.I.\" He added that he and Mr. Altman had resigned because the publicity about B.C.C.I. and First American could have an adverse impact on the bank. **********\"Mr. Altman and I must insure that this public attention does not adversely affect the company,\" Mr. Clifford said in a statement. **********He also said he was gratified that First American customers had remained loyal throughout the affair. **********But despite statements that the bank remains in strong condition, a confidential report from the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, gave the bank a rating of \"4\" on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 meaning that a bank is about to fail. The bank has struggled recently with bad real estate loans reflecting the recession in the Washington area. **********The Comptroller's office said an institution with a \"4\" rating was one in which \"a high potential for failure is present but is not yet imminent or pronounced.\" **********Jack W. Beddow, chief executive of the bank's holding company, said that there had been some impact on the bank as a result of the growing difficulties surrounding its association with B.C.C.I., but that it was \"mild\" and depositors were overwhelmingly remaining confident in the bank. \"There have been phone calls, inquiries and some confusion, but that is all,\" he said. **********Mr. Katzenbach, who now practices law in Morristown, N.J., said he was \"honored to have the opportunity to help guide First American into a new chapter in its distinguished history.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/17/world/pope-asks-pardon-of-brazil-s-indians.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1991-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pope Asks Pardon of Brazil's Indians", "print_headline": "Pope Asks Pardon of Brazil's Indians", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II offered symbolic atonement to Brazil's dwindling Indian population today for the \"weakness and defects\" of some missionaries during centuries of evangelism.

But advocates say the situation is troubling because conservative attitudes arising from Roman Catholicism both predispose this country to the spread of AIDS and hamper its prevention. **********Catholicism dominates Irish society, with 90 to 95 percent of the population of 3.5 million people professing affiliation with the church. Efforts to promote the use of condoms have been opposed because they clash with the church's teachings. The distribution of clean needles to drug addicts has run into similar church-led opposition on the ground that it promotes drug abuse.  'Attitudes Have to Change' **********In line with church teachings, abortion is illegal here, making it more likely that mothers with AIDS will pass on the disease to babies. Homosexuality is outlawed as well, leading some campaigners against AIDS to conclude that many gay men are disguising their sexual orientation by marrying and having children, and perhaps further helping the disease's spread. **********Some political observers say that the election in December of Mary Robinson, a political outsider, as the first woman to be Ireland's President may signal a liberalizing of attitudes, although the presidency is a largely ceremonial post. A member of the small, leftist Labor Party, Mrs. Robinson campaigned hard for the liberalization of laws on divorce, contraception and homosexuality. **********\"Attitudes have to change in Ireland,\" said Brian Murray, chairman of a voluntary organization, Cairde, that helps AIDS victims. \"Otherwise, there will not be tolerance of the use of condoms or clean needles. Attitudes arising from Catholicism have produced a very conservative moral ethos that decries the use of condoms in any context. Governments try to fall in behind public opinion and public opinion is led by the church on these issues.\" **********The Government says it is working hard to stem the disease's spread and points to its compulsory AIDS education program in secondary schools and its financing of a drug-treatment center in Dublin that offers condoms, clean needles and counseling. **********The church, too, offers materials to help teachers educate students about the dangers of AIDS. It emphasizes monogamy and abstinence. Church and Morality **********\"The Catholic Church, as is widely known, promotes the view that sexual morality, if observed, would prove to be a great antidote to the spread of AIDS,\" said Des Cryan, a spokesman in the Catholic Press and Information Office. \"And the general attitude in Ireland, not just among Catholics, but the general attitude is that they basically oppose free, clean-needle schemes because they think it would contribute to drug abuse.\" **********Government statistics put the number of people here diagnosed as having AIDS at 172 as of October. Nearly 1,000 more were said to be infected with the HIV virus, which causes the disease, but doctors and advocates say that there could actually be three times as many cases. **********World Health Organization figures show that for 1989 there were 1.3 diagnosed cases of AIDS reported here for every 100,000 people while the United States had 13.3 per 100,000. **********Here, about 60 percent of people with the virus and nearly half of those with AIDS are intravenous drug users, representing the sad legacy of cheap heroin dumped into the poor housing projects of Dublin and other European cities in the early 1980's. **********The spread of the disease among homosexual men is viewed by officials as a lesser problem and statistics show only 135 infected with the virus. **********Those active in fighting AIDS say the country's conservative, church-influenced attitudes have led to the failure both by church and Government to develop practical and comprehensive programs against the disease. **********The state-financed program for drug users, which includes outreach workers, is faulted for its location in a fashionable section of Dublin, which critics say leaves it inaccessible to people in deprived areas where drug abuse flourishes.  Sexual Orientation Disguised **********The Government has not directed an AIDS education campaign at homosexual men. James Walsh, the state AIDS coordinator, said the rate of homosexual infection slowed in Ireland as it did in other countries after gays started employing safer sexual practices in the mid-1980's. **********But some advocates say the actual number of cases of AIDS infection among gay men is not 135 but closer to 2,000. Because homosexuality is illegal, they say, many homosexuals disguise their sexual orientation, marry and have children. **********Official statistics are also viewed as misleading in another way. Anti-AIDS campaigners say that because of largescale emigration, especially among people between the ages of 18 and 35, many Irish citizens infected with the virus could be in other countries. **********The Irish characterize their country as a large village of sorts -- family-oriented, relatively slow to change but edging toward greater secularism. **********Many young people who ignore the church's moral arguments against risky sexual and drug activities still share traditional values like the importance of having a family. **********At St. James's Hospital, which treats most of Dublin's AIDS cases, the state's only AIDS consultant said that half of the 120 women there infected with the virus wanted to get pregnant, despite counseling about the disease. The consultant, Dr. Fiona Mulcahy, said the other half insisted that they did not want to get pregnant, but less than a third used contraception.  Amniocentesis Unlikely **********Scientists think that about 40 percent of babies of infected mothers will themselves be born with the AIDS virus and die, and that the rest will lose their mothers. Official statistics show that Ireland has 69 babies infected with the AIDS virus. **********Family planning experts say it is still nearly impossible to obtain amniocentesis -- the medical procedure that can trace fetal abnormalities -- because detection of defects could lead to a woman seeking an abortion. **********Similarly, until 1979 it was illegal to provide contraceptive services and information; condoms can now be legally sold only at pharmacies, doctors' offices, clinics that treat sexually transmitted diseases, state health boards and family planning centers. **********The Roman Catholic Church offers what it calls a \"resource pack\" as a guide to help teachers discuss AIDS with secondary school students. **********The material says that condoms, if used correctly, reduce the risk of infection but provide nothing like complete protection. It says that \"sexual intercourse expresses the total, unconditional self-giving of husband and wife, with openness to the procreation of new life,\" and that the \"use of contraceptives contradicts this truth and is, therefore, morally wrong.\" **********The Government began its AIDS education program this school year over the objection of Catholic bishops who viewed it as morally aimless. Mr. Walsh said that the program seeks to promote mutual fidelity in sexual relationships. Students are advised that if they do take risks, condoms provide highly effective prevention. A Challenge to the People **********Mr. Walsh says that some people have criticized this approach from the opposite extreme of the bishops, as slanted too heavily toward trying to instill sexual morality. **********Campaigners against AIDS say that to prevent the disease from taking a grim toll, the Irish must challenge the church and other symbols of authority. **********David Esson, who runs a self-help group for AIDS victims called Irish Frontliners, said, \"Irish people are conditioned in such a way that no matter how big the biggest wrong, they do not speak out against authority, be it the church, a Government minister, a policeman or a teacher.\" **********\"They accept what is happening,\" he said. \"This means that we have lost quite a lot of people so far to AIDS and we are going to lose quite a lot more.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/business/britain-cuts-interest-rate-half-a-point.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1991-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britain Cuts Interest Rate Half a Point", "print_headline": "Britain Cuts Interest Rate Half a Point", "body_text": " **********In response to mounting political pressure and growing signs that Britain's recession is becoming severe, the Conservative Government today cut interest rates by half a percentage point. Banks followed suit, reducing their main rates to 13.5 percent. **********Several economists, including some prominent Thatcherites and opposition leaders, described the cut as too little and too late to offer much help to the economy. \"The forces have already been set in motion for a quite nasty recession in the United Kingdom,\" said Paul Turnbull, an economist at Smith New Court Securities P.L.C., a London brokerage. **********But Government officials stressed that fighting inflation remained the top priority and said they would be cautious about making additional rate cuts. Inflation declined to 9.3 percent in December from a peak of 10.9 percent in the fall, but is still the highest in the European Community. **********The interest-rate cut was the first since a one-point reduction in October, when Britain joined the European Monetary System, linking the value of the pound to other European currencies. **********The debate about whether to join the system was one issue that had split the Conservative Party and led to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher, who resigned as Prime Minister in November.  Thatcher's Fears **********Mrs. Thatcher had resisted joining the system, fearing that it would undermine British sovereignty by reducing Government control over interest rates and thus the British economy. Her fears seem to have been borne out. **********The 10 countries now in the system are obligated to keep their currencies within a certain band relative to the others, and interest rates are a principal means of doing that. **********Those in favor of joining the system, including John Major, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer before succeeding Mrs. Thatcher as Prime Minister, argued that membership would help give Britain the discipline to check inflation. The system is dominated by the German mark, which means that the Bundesbank, Germany's inflation-fighting central bank, has significant influence over the interest-rate policies of other countries. **********Indeed, the Bundesbank seemed to reduce Britain's room to cut rates when it raised some rates by a half a point on Jan. 31. **********David R. Walton, an economist at Goldman Sachs International Ltd., pointed out that the pound was in the bottom half of its band against the nine other currencies in the monetary system. But the main constraint on the British Government cutting rates has been that the pound has been near its lower limit against the Spanish peseta.

While the Court has shown its ideological turn mainly in civil rights and social policy, the implications are clear for economic affairs as well: The liberal activist court that intervened actively and eagerly in areas from clean air to employment policy is no more. **********But the satisfaction of business leaders with this turn of events is premature. A conservative court may mean that intervention in corporate business affairs will no longer come from the judicial arena. But it is likely to put intervention back, with increased vigor, in 51 separate arenas -- the state legislatures and Congress. The upshot will be 51 headaches for business. **********The central judicial theme of the Rehnquist Court is deference to the legislature, and that is not likely to change if Clarence Thomas joins the Court. In this last term, for example, in Pacific Mutual Life Insurance v. Haslip, the Court upheld a huge punitive damage to an Alabama woman who had been defrauded of $4,000. The Justices made clear that they were not applauding juries going overboard in awarding damages. Rather, they were deferring to states to set standards for jury awards. Two years ago, when the Court sharply curtailed discrimination cases by changing the burden of proof to the employee, it was not saying that affirmative action is wrong, overdone or unconstitutional. Instead, it put responsibility on Congress to set whatever rules it wanted. **********This is a sharp turnaround. For decades, Congress and the state legislatures used an activist Court to avoid responsibility in controversial and difficult policy decisions -- from abortion to crime to the environment. They simply passed the buck to the Court. They believed that the justices, by and large, would reflect their basic viewpoints and that the justices were ready -- and eager -- to take on the responsibility and power. No more. **********The Rehnquist Court, unlike the Warren and Burger Courts, no longer reflects the Democratic and largely liberal political majority present in Congress and most state legislatures. The bulk of the key decisions in the last court docket were decided in a conservative direction by 5-4 or, increasingly, 6-3 margins. Seven of the nine justices now on the Court were appointed by Republican Presidents; with Thurgood Marshall's retirement, it will be eight. **********As the Court shows it is not willing to let the legislatures off the hook, state lawmakers are increasingly becoming aware that to defer politically difficult and controversial decisions to the Court may be disastrous for them. That could result either in the wrong political result or in having the issues flipped right back to the state level. Newly energized and active legislatures have cropped up as a result. **********Companies are beginning to feel the pain of 50 separate sets of state regulations and requirements for packaging, labeling, content, environmental controls, product liability and insurance. They have only seen the tip of the iceberg. The Court has sent a clear signal to the states, empowering the legislatures and their members, spurring new activism. More state legislatures have expanded their regulatory agendas, becoming increasingly involved in consumer and environmental matters, in ways that generally please consumer advocates and environmentalists. That activism, in turn, has spurred wider use of initiatives and referendums at the polls, requiring tremendous effort on the part of business to hold its own. **********As for Congress, its recent lethargy shows signs of ending. It feels embattled by a popular Republican President and an ideologically hostile Supreme Court. The Court's turn to the right will most likely be the catalyst to get the Congress moving again -- and not in directions that will please business. Consider some items at the top of the Congressional agenda now: the 1991 Civil Rights bill, striker replacement legislation, mandated and employer-provided health benefits. None are issues that small -- or big -- business wants to see favored with aggressive Congressional action. **********For business, an active conservative Court will mean not relaxation, but challenge -- the daunting challenge of making its voice heard in 51 separate arenas across the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/20/world/abc-makes-an-effort-to-reassure-children.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 256, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ABC Makes an Effort To Reassure Children", "print_headline": "ABC Makes an Effort To Reassure Children", "body_text": " **********Prompted by concerns that live scenes from the war front might frighten children more accustomed to seeing the skirmishes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ABC News took time yesterday morning to explain the war to youngsters during a special report on the Persian Gulf conflict. **********After apologizing to young viewers for pre-empting the cartoons they usually watch on Saturday, Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor, said, \"Kids should also remember that this is all happening far away and that there is no danger to them at home.\" **********In the weeks leading up to the war in the Persian Gulf, ABC News executives discussed how they would deal with images that might be disturbing to children. **********Patrick M.

Lumber industry officials and environmental groups said it appeared to be the first time a major timber company in California, and perhaps the nation, had given up the practice, which has been strongly criticized by environmentalists. **********Clear-cutting is cutting down all the trees in an area at once. While timber companies have said the practice is sound, environmentalists have said it creates eyesores, increases erosion and eliminates wildlife habitat. **********Lousiana-Pacific, based in Portland, Ore., said it was responding to public sentiment expressed last November in a statewide initiative that would have virtually eliminated clear-cutting and placed other strict controls on forestry in California. While the initiative, known as Proposition 130, was narrowly defeated, the election was \"close enough to tell us there's genuine interest and concern in California\" about clear-cutting, Harry A. Merlo, the company's president, said in a statement. **********An official of the Sierra Club applauded the decision. \"I think that eliminating clear-cutting is a very laudable move,\" said Gail Lucas, forest issues representative for the organization in California. \"It reflects an awareness of the public's concern and distaste for that kind of activity.\"  Other Reasons Suggested **********Ms. Lucas said, however, that there were other issues about which environmentalists are concerned, like making sure that trees are harvested only as fast as they can be replenished and allowing trees to grow to full maturity before they are cut down. **********Officials of some other environmental and industry groups said that Mr. Merlo could have several reasons for promising to phase out clear-cutting. For one thing, the company's harvesting of timber in California is likely to be severely restricted anyway to protect the northern spotted owl, which has been designated a threatened species. So the company might have little extra to lose and a lot of good will to gain by stopping clear-cutting. **********In addition, it was suggested that Louisiana-Pacific appears to be hoping that giving up clear-cutting will stave off stricter regulations on such aspects as how many trees it can cut down or how old trees must be before they can be cut.  Agreement Seen Near **********It was not clear whether other companies would follow Louisiana-Pacific's lead. David Kaney, general manager of the Simpson Timber Company in Arcata, another major California company, said Simpson planned to continue clear-cutting because \"to give up clear-cutting would reduce the productivity of the land by 40 percent.\" **********Still, environmentalists said that other concessions by timber companies could be on the way. **********In California, seven large environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the Audubon Society, were said to be nearing an agreement with lumber companies over proposed state legislation that would greatly change the way forestry is conducted in the state. **********The proposed legislation would accomplish part of what Proposition 130 tried to do in terms of reducing clearcutting, regulating the rate at which trees can be cut and so on. But it would not be quite as stringent, so it could win acceptance by the lumber companies, officials familiar with the negotiations said. A Major Landowner **********Several small lumber companies in California and elsewhere never practiced clear-cutting, preferring to harvest selected trees in a forest. In the state of Washington, the Plum Creek Timber Company, after coming under fierce attack from environmentalists, promised to leave more trees standing to help harvested areas regenerate. **********Louisiana-Pacific is a major landowner in California, with nearly 500,000 acres, mostly redwood and Douglas fir. A spokesman, Barry Lacter, said clear-cutting was used for 15 to 20 percent of the company's harvest from those lands. **********The company does not clear-cut on the 1.5 million acres it owns outside California because the practice is not appropriate for the trees in those areas, he said. Mr. Lacter said the company would continue to take timber from clear-cuts on national forest land, where the harvesting method is determined by the Forest Service. **********Mr. Merlo of Louisiana-Pacific has a reputation as an industry maverick. While he has not agreed with or been popular with environmentalists, he has long realized that environmental restrictions would reduce the supply of trees available to forest products companies. He has been shifting his company toward making boards out of wood chips that can be cut from small, plentiful trees such as aspen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/09/world/vietnamese-foreign-minister-asks-for-ties-now-with-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vietnamese Foreign Minister Asks for Ties Now With U.S.", "print_headline": "Vietnamese Foreign Minister Asks for Ties Now With U.S.", "body_text": " **********The new Foreign Minister of Vietnam called today for the immediate restoration of diplomatic ties between Vietnam and the United States and described the Bush Administration's refusal to end a 16-year trade embargo against this impoverished nation as \"not right.\" **********At a news conference with foreign journalists, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said the United States had increased its demands for restoring relations with Vietnam. \"If the conditions continue, it will be difficult to reach a settlement,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/iacocca-might-sell-shares.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iacocca Might Sell Shares", "print_headline": "Iacocca Might Sell Shares", "body_text": " **********Lee A.

Yeltsin of the Russian republic was reassuringly prosaic this weekend as he succeeded to the leadership mantle of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the President of a Soviet Union that has melted out from under him. **********While the watching Western world at first may miss Mr.  Gorbachev's flourishes about historic new beginnings replete with fresh catchwords to match \"glasnost\" and \"perestroika,\" there is something to be said for Mr. Yeltsin's bluff push forward sans rhetoric with the new Commonwealth of Independent States. **********Far from bang or whimper, the union went out with a laborious sigh as Mr. Yeltsin signed up the old Soviet republics to scramble with him back from the edge and try a fresh course toward a future he says will be harsh but ultimately redeeming.  [ Texts of the agreements signed in Alma-Ata are on page A10. ] **********In this hope, the Alma-Ata meeting in the Kazakh capital near the Chinese border was merciful for its dearth of grand promises. The Soviet empire lies fallen and drenched in highblown promises and political bombast, and in the endless resort to apocalyptic warnings. Routine references to the likelihood of food riots are this season's replacement for last year's \"famine\" talk in the de rigueur doomsday musings of Russian politics. **********Mr. Yeltsin displayed this weekend how he plays at neither dire warnings -- \"No pessimism,\" he told the public last week -- nor at the bounding internationalist's role that Mr. Gorbachev perfected for the foreign audience. **********Boris Yeltsin is a politician for the domestic landscape, a strategist rooted in the provincial earth. He looks for reassurances from his sense of the ordinary crowd, and not from an outside world breathless at the drama it imagines here in the fallen empire's struggle to get up and go forward. The Art of Compromise **********Mr. Yeltsin is showing some skill at a necessary political art that has been largely absent across the years of Mr. Gorbachev's retreat from totalitarian military and domestic policies. This is the art of compromise. It is an art for which Mr. Gorbachev had no domestic inkling or appetite as he brandished the age-old Kremlin ways of imperious soliloquy and sweeping decree even in trying to apportion democracy and economic change. **********Mr. Yeltsin has already cut some deals, and the most obvious is the new commonwealth, a confused, far-from-perfect arrangement whose only early virtue is in demonstrating the common resolve to find a pragmatic way forward from the disaster of Communism. **********In compromising, Mr. Yeltsin has taken to dispatching political aides to rivals and colleagues to make private deals the way Mr. Gorbachev never did. They helped clear the way both for the enlarged commonwealth and for some of its early compromises, like the agreement that Russia would succeed to the Soviet seat on the United Nations Security Council. **********The latter is a key requirement of the Bush Administration's strategy to see nuclear weapons scaled down and controlled on a single territory, Russia. **********In seeking the Security Council seat, Mr. Yeltsin thus had some extra weight in pointing to the United States, which is strategically withholding recognition of the republics until important military matters are settled. **********In the opening display of the commonwealth's gathering of the 11 republic's leaders, there were surreal and disheartening echoes as of a party Politburo meeting that has gone public and go-go in the search to survive. With the exception of a committed insurgent like President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia, the gathering was a grouping of veteran party infighters. When Rakhman N. Nabiyev, the white-haired President of Tadzhikistan, suddenly roused himself from a passive stare to launch a gruff paean to harnessing hydroelectric power, there was the faint aroma of Stalin's pipe smoke in the room. **********In this disquieting aura, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine was the most successful example of the mass conversion of convenience that the more fleet-footed party politicians have undergone. He beamed next to his nationalist flag while back home his former Communist majority in the Parliament worked on fresh nationalist nostrums and impassioned demurrals from commonwealth commitment. **********But at the heart of this motley, post-Communist Canterbury pilgrimage here in the moribund empire's snowbound outback sat President Yeltsin, happy for the individuals' having trekked at all, regardless of their separate histories and intrigues. Even more than the dominance of geography and resources presented by his Russia, Mr. Yeltsin is the leader of the new commonwealth by dint of his personal risks in anticipating the end of Communism. Without Mr. Yeltsin in its midst, the gathering would truly resemble reconstructed Communism. **********Boris N. Yeltsin was the politician who stood alone four years ago, when others temporized, to be purged from Mr. Gorbachev's party hierarchy for insisting that change had to come far faster than Mr. Gorbachev's vision allowed. On the outs, he was free to believe in Mr. Gorbachev's electoral reform even more than Mr. Gorbachev, and so Mr. Yeltsin submitted to popular election and won Russia. **********From this vantage, he gained the strength to stand again last August while others like Mr. Kravchuk temporized and to insist that the coup by the Kremlin hard-liners was hollow and unfrightening. Whether the frail, history-stained commonwealth born of the failed coup will progress at all beyond its opening muted ceremony was unanswerable in Alma-Ata. But without Mr. Yeltsin's presence, this would barely be a serious question."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/business/time-warner-to-begin-rights-offering-today.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1991-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 597, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner to Begin Rights Offering Today", "print_headline": "Time Warner to Begin Rights Offering Today", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that it would begin its rights offering today to raise $2.8 billion through the sale of 34.5 million new shares of stock at $80 a share. **********Ten investment banks will underwrite the offering, which gives shareholder six-tenths of a right, for each share they own, to buy a share of stock at $80.

But the deal angered shareholders and raised concerns at the Securities and Exchange Commission that forced Time Warner to scrap that deal and come up with a new one. In the first deal, shareholders generally felt that they were being coerced into buying stock at a price that they could not determine before the deal actually closed. **********Investment bankers are committed to the new rights offering, although they have a limited number of exit clauses.

Nicholas Jr., and the vice chairman, Gerald M. Levin -- will not have their options adjusted to reflect the stock's dilution. That is an apparent response to shareholders' concerns that the executives were being protected while other shareholders were being asked to put more money into the deal. **********Investment bankers and analysts differed yesterday on how they expected the stock and the rights to perform. **********Several investment bankers involved in the deal anticipated a dip in the stock price. \"My guess is that it is a big financing and a lot to absorb, so it will go down slightly,\" said a media analyst who has followed the deal but declined to be identified. **********In any case, the new deal is expected to be more appealing to arbitragers than the previous offering, because of the fixed price. **********For example, an arbitrager might sell the stock short at $90, and then buy rights for $9.75, giving him the opportunity to make 25 cents on the transaction. The right would allow him to buy a share at $80, putting his total cost at $89.75. **********On the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Time Warner's share price closed at $89.75, down $3.875, as news of the new deal leaked out. **********What could stem a further drop in the stock is the investor enthusiasm that the deal might prompt.

Hinson, Midway's chairman and chief executive, said, \"We're committed to the maintenance of our published schedules and to honor all passenger reservations and tickets.\" **********He added that Midway had to file for bankruptcy protection before Continental Bank would extend credit. The step makes the bank the first claim on the airline's assets in repaying money owed. Similarly, Pan American World Airways filed for Chapter 11 protection to get a $150 million loan from Bankers Trust. **********In a news conference, Mr. Hinson said that the airline would break even in March and that current bookings were at a high. **********\"Our wish is to emerge from this financial reorganization as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"We got into a situation where circumstances overwhelmed us.\" **********The bankruptcy filing, made Monday night, will enable the carrier to shrink its operations and restructure its finances, Mr. Hinson said. **********Several analysts said that the carrier, whose main hub is at Midway Airport in Chicago, had a chance to reorganize and come out bankruptcy, but that much would depend on the economy. **********\"Unless there is a traffic recovery by June, then the likelihood of a successful reorganization is dim,\" said Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Midway's shares fell $1.25 each yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $2.625. The percentage drop, of 32.3 percent, was the Big Board's largest. **********What put Midway into its precarious position was an attempt to seize the opportunity from the troubles at Eastern Airlines to build a second hub in Philadelphia. Eastern had to keep selling assets to cover its losses, while it tried to revive under the protection of Chapter 11, and Midway was able to buy landing slots, gates, international routes and planes from Eastern for more than $200 million. **********The move made strategic sense, but Midway ran into fierce competition from USAir, which did not want another carrier on its turf. USAir, which had also sought Eastern's assets, built up its service at the hub. **********In addition, Eastern, which is now being liquidated, cut fares to $79 one way between the Northeast and Florida in a desperate move to win back traffic. That put competitive pressure on Midway. Final Blow: Fuel Prices **********The final blow to Midway came with the crisis in the Persian Gulf, which sent jet fuel prices soaring while traffic began to fall -- \"both things they had no control over,\" Mr. Maldutis said. **********In October, the carrier agreed to sell its Philadelphia assets to USAir for $67.5 million, taking a loss of more than $30 million on the sale. Midway, which kept the planes it bought from Eastern, began withdrawing from Philadelphia on Jan. 8. **********Midway, which employs 5,700 workers, suspended payments on leases for aircraft and loan payments in December and began talks with its lessors and lenders to reduce costs. **********\"Over the past eight months, Midway and its investment bankers have explored virtually every option available in order to attract additional capital,\" Mr. Hinson said. The efforts failed, he said, because of the hostile environment facing the industry. **********One thing in Midway's favor is that travelers have become accustomed to Chapter 11 filings by airlines. There may be a small loss of bookings in the first few days after a filing, but in other cases bookings have gone back to normal once travel agents and the public realized that the carrier was operating its flights. **********Continental Airlines, for example, filed for Chapter 11 protection last December and experienced only a small decline in bookings. Since then, it has been operating normally. **********Midway began as a no frills discount carrier in 1979 and grew rapidly, becoming profitable two years later. The established carriers, however, began to respond to its low fares and Midway changed strategy, becoming a high-cost carrier catering to the business traveler.  Changing Strategies **********It offered first-class service for the price of coach, which worked at first, but again the carrier was at a disadvantage. It was unable to offer the extensive frequent-flier programs of the majors and did not have the marketing influence that comes from owning extensive reservation systems. It could not offer frequent flights to many cities. **********Again in the late 1980's the carrier changed strategy, becoming a niche carrier, which emphasized Midway Airport's advantages -- being close to downtown Chicago and less crowded than O'Hare International Airport."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/29/business/company-news-otis-elevator-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Otis Elevator Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Otis Elevator Deal", "body_text": " **********The Otis Elevator Company, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation, said it had signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in the Hankook Engineering Company, an elevator company based in Seoul, South Korea.

The headline reads, \"Find another $28,500 car with all of this and we'll buy it for you.\" **********Sterling says that before it will make good on its promises to buy a customer a rival luxury car, if it meets the features on the Sterling 827SL, the customer has to visit a Sterling showroom to make his case. **********Sterling spent $20 million last year on print and television ads but has not decided how much it will spend this year until Grace & Rothschild can devise the longer-term effort. **********With about $75 million in billings, Grace & Rothschild was founded in 1986 by Ms. Rothschild and Roy Grace, two expatriates from the large firm of Doyle Dane Bernbach. While at their old employer, Mr. Grace had been creative director on an Alka-Seltzer ad -- \"That's a Spicy Meatball,\" says a heartburned actor flubbing his lines -- and an American Tourister luggage ad -- a gorilla manhandles a suitcase -- now honored by the Museum of Modern Art as classic TV commercials. His collague, Ms. Rothschild, worked on campaigns for Volkswagen and Chivas Regal. Ms. Rothschild wrote the copy for the Range Rover ads. **********Michael B. Jackling, vice president of marketing for Sterling Motor Cars, the Miami-based importer of the vehicles, hired the firm because he had admired the Range Rover ads. \"Their tone,\" he said, \"is absolutely perfect.\" Being the ad agency for a sister company did not hurt, either. **********Grace & Rothschild believes advertising grows out of the product, not market research. Such research is only valuable for indicating what consumers might think about a product, the agency's founders say. \"Market research tells you to make an Edsel or New Coke,\" Mr. Grace said. **********With J & B Scotch, another Grace & Rothschild client, market research had shown that people thought the brand was a drink for older consumers. \"But we didn't say, 'This is not your father's J & B,' \" Ms. Rothschild said. \"We did a campaign that made people come to that conclusion on their own.\" **********In ads written by Ms. Rothschild, the initials J & B were depicted in situations with a hip fillip. One Christmas ad, for example, showed the large and puzzling letters, \" ingle ells, ingle ells.\" The caption: \"The holidays aren't the same without J & B.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/02/business/company-news-bankamerica-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BankAmerica Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BankAmerica Bid", "body_text": " **********The BankAmerica Corporation will bid for all of the failed Bank of New England Corporation, BankAmerica's chairman, Richard Rosenberg, said.

It has fallen 4.7 percent from its 1991 high of 1,149.80, which was set on July 11. **********James Capel Inc. in London is telling its clients to take profits now and wait until the fourth quarter before deciding on whether they should return to Stockholm. UBS Phillips Drew of London is cutting its forecast for the Affarsvalden index to 1,050 by year's end, down from 1,100. **********Because many of the country's blue chip companies, like Astra and Ericsson, depend on exports, the outlook for the economies of Europe and the United States are just as critical to investors as that for Sweden. And the news is not rosy. The recovery in America may not be vigorous. In England, the recession is dragging on. And in Germany, a major Swedish trading partner, the economy is slowing and interest rates could rise another notch. **********The change in sentiment toward the Swedish market is also a result of a worry over the latest round of six-month earnings reports, which began to come out last week. SKR, the ball-bearing manufacturer, announced a 95 percent drop in pre-tax profits. The company said it expected earnings to improve in the second half of the year, an announcement that gave the stock market a little lift at the end of the week. **********Sweden's own economic outlook is also darker than many local investors had thought. The recession is expected to continue through this year, the experts say, with forecasts showing a weak recovery, at best, developing next year. **********Although analysts at UBS expect corporate earnings to increase 20 percent to 25 percent in 1992, part of the rebound will be a result of one-time restructuring charges many companies are taking this year year to cut costs. Some companies, like Volvo, also had major costs for development of new models, which will not be repeated. **********The September election, in which the current Government of Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, will be fighting for its political life, is also adding uncertainity. **********The possibility of a coalition government of several conservative and non-Socialist parties could add impetus to the move that is seeking to tilt what was once a major Western welfare state toward an open market orientation. But the coalition, analysts argue, could break apart over other issues, like nuclear power and membership in the European Community. And in recent polls, the Social Democrats, although still trailing, have gained some ground. **********Much of the impetus for the market rally came from signs of a change in the Social Democrats' attitude and economic management. Less inclined toward innovation, the Government, analysts say, is now more likely to use inflation than the unemployment rate as the key guide to policy. **********The Government's decision to apply for membership in the European Community also encouraged many foreign investors to buy stocks before the country's stock market is forced by E.C. rules to open its door fully to foreigners. According to James Capel, foreigners were net purchasers of 3.7 billion kronor worth of stock by the end of May, compared with 1.2 billion kronor for all of last year. **********The decision to tie the krona to a basket of European currencies, as represented in the European Currency Unit, gave the Swedish currency a new stability. It opened the way for cuts in interest rates at home and raised confidence that the government would not use krona devaluations just to make Swedish exports cheaper abroad. **********In addition, two major deals, both involving the Wallenberg family, which has major stakes in many Swedish companies, poured billions of kronor into the market, helping to spur domestic buying. One was the friendly $2.8 billion takeover of Alfa-Laval, a manufacturer of dairy machinery, by Switzerland's Tetra Pak. The second was the purchase by the Wallenbergs of the remaining shares in Saab-Scania that they did not own. **********The market also rebounded from a very low level, having fallen 37.6 percent after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Even after this year's rally, the market is 18 percent below its pre-invasion level, according to the Financial Times index of world stock markets. During the war rally in January and February, the market was the top performer in the Financial Times index, rising 27 percent. **********\"There is no room for any disappointments coming through,\" said Roddy Bridge of UBS in London. \"If this earnings period disappoints, the cash that had been supporting the market can turn around and the market can fall.

But everyone, it seems, could be wrong. **********A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published this summer by Arline Geronimus, a researcher at the University of Michigan, and Sanders Korenman, a Princeton economist, offers striking evidence that early motherhood does not much affect women's future earnings or increase the probability they will end up on welfare. **********No reasonable interpretation of the results, however, will provide comfort to the more-the-merrier, birth-control-is-genocide crowd. The fact that poor women lose little by giving birth as teen-agers, Mr. Korenman argues, says only that poor women have little to lose. **********Study after study has shown that girls who have babies end up poorer and less educated than other women. And the experience of the women in the broad sample used by Ms. Geronimus and Mr. Korenman is no different. Among women followed for two decades by the Center for Human Resource Research at Ohio State University, those who became mothers as teen-agers were four times as likely to end up on welfare and three times as likely to become dropouts as those who waited to have babies. **********But correlation is not causation: The fact that people with heart disease average more sleep than healthy adults does not mean that sleep damages the heart. And as one might expect, studies that have been controlled for family background -- parents' income, race, education and occupational status -- suggest that early pregnancy is just one of several factors determining the economic future of young women. **********Ms. Geronimus and Mr. Korenman suspected, however, that these standard background variables did not capture all the relevant differences between families. So they limited their own statistical analysis to a sub-sample of 51 families in which at least one sister had a baby before age 20 and at least one did not. **********They discovered that teen-age motherhood lost most of its dismal predictive value: Early parenthood in itself apparently did not make it more likely that the women would end their schooling before high school graduation or become dependent on welfare. **********What is one to make of this remarkable finding? The casual interpretation is that teen-age pregnancy is no big deal -- and thus that denying teen-agers easy access to birth control information and abortion would have no great social or economic consequence. **********And apparently inadvertently, Ms. Geronimus has given her critics reason to believe this is her own reading of the evidence. In earlier scholarly articles she argued that contrary to the conventional wisdom poor women were more apt to deliver healthy babies when they were teen-agers -- before their capacity for successful reproduction was damaged by drugs and hard living. She has also speculated that poor teen-age mothers, in contrast to older impoverished mothers, are better able to draw on extended families for support of the young. **********But a simpler and more defensible interpretation of this study's result is that 1990's-style poverty is apt to ruin the lives of young women, whether or not they give birth as teen-agers. The fact that so many poor girls choose to have the babies may follow from their sense that they have nothing better to look forward to. Or as Ms. Geronomus put it, \"Teen-age fertility among the poor may well be an adaptive response to social reality.\" **********This does not imply that teen-age motherhood is any less of a catastrophe: Something is deeply wrong, it is safe to assume, when 15-year-old girls would rather change diapers than get on with the adventure of growing up. Nor does it get politicians and school administrators off the hook on abortion and contraception. Girls who are motivated to break out of poverty may still lack the means to make it without help in remaining childless. **********What the findings may do, however, is make it less respectable to dismiss poverty as the consequence of sin. The very idea of an underclass is an embarrassment to a nation that takes great pride in social mobility. Thus for many Americans, the only plausible explanation for chronic poverty in a land of opportunity is moral deficiency. **********Few of the liberal social scientists who have been sounding the alarm about teen-age parenthood in the last decade would classify themselves as moralists. But the idea that poverty is a consequence of casual, early sex does mesh neatly with the view that bad things mostly happen to bad people. And while the Geronimus-Korenman research is not likely to cause a sea change in attitudes, it might slow the gradual but unmistakable erosion of public sympathy for the victims of poverty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/business/nynex-names-vice-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nynex Names Vice President", "print_headline": "Nynex Names Vice President", "body_text": " **********The Nynex Corporation yesterday named former Representative Thomas J.

Viewers of CNN had just seen the men together at the podium of the lately concluded Soviet Congress, and the two leaders had also been interviewed separately here and there.

The monitors beneath the huge American flag on the network set confirmed that people all over the United States were in on it. **********Most of the stars' lines were straight out of stock, but this show was not about the script; it was about the players. Their testy relationship was no secret to anybody who watched the evening news. How would they behave when yoked together by the requirements of politics at home and by public relations on a global stage? **********Several times Mr. Gorbachev started a reply by remarking that he agreed with what Boris Nikolayevich had just said, and Mr. Yeltsin referred courteously to Mikhail Sergeyevich, but a contrary spirit kept peeping naughtily through the good manners. **********Mr. Gorbachev fitted more comfortably into the elegant surroundings. Mr. Yeltsin, with a face that bore the marks of a rough-and-tumble career, occupied his period chair like a slugger at a dinner party, now and then knocking over a piece of china, maybe by accident, maybe not. **********After Mr. Gorbachev spoke of \"cooperation\" in response to Mr. Jennings's very first question about how the two were getting along, Mr. Yeltsin moved in with the reminder that not long ago his comrade had considered him a political corpse. **********He made it plain that if relations were now improved between them, it was because the Soviet President had come round to the Yeltsin position on radical reform. Mr. Gorbachev, who consistently took a mollifying tone, responded like a therapist: \"Let each remain his own person.\" **********On farm problems Mr. Gorbachev spun out some bureaucratese about the creation of \"a normally functioning market.\" But Mr. Yeltsin declared challengingly that Russia would deal directly with the world's grain exchanges without any intermediaries, meaning the central Government.

When the MCI Communications Corporation began seriously to erode the monopoly held by American Telephone and Telegraph on long-distance service in the mid-1970's, and again, when A.T.&T. was broken up several years later, numerous books circulated through the company, recalled Burke Stinson, an A.T.&T. public relations manager. \"Anxiety levels were so high that managers bought everything from how-to marketing books to 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,' \" he said. **********A.T.&.T. recently bought 20,000 copies of \"Working from Home\" as gifts for people who provided the company with work-at-home tips which it then printed in its customer newsletter. But, a growing number of A.T.&T. people are starting to work from home, too. \"I suspect we'll send copies to our own people soon,\" Mr. Stinson said.

On that day, the International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Hans Blix, told the Security Council that Iraq's disclosures about its nuclear installations were still inadequate, even though Iraq had acknowledged that it had a secret enrichment program. **********The inspection team's conclusion appeared to support Iraq's claim that it is not hiding nuclear installations. A report in May by an Iraqi defector said Iraq had produced 90 pounds of enriched uranium, enough for two bombs. After this report, Mr. Bush said President Saddam Hussein was lying and indicated that the United States might resume attacks on Iraq if it kept trying to produce nuclear weapons. **********[ State Department and other officials familiar with intellgience reports on Iraq's nuclear ability said they remained skeptical of the new report. \"That doesn't ring right,\" an official said. \"We know they produced some highly enriched material and that material was taken out of some of those facilities.\" ] U.N.

Aides Satisfied **********The United Nations officials now say they know all they need to about these plants and are reasonably sure that they have not produced any weapons-grade enriched uranium by the time the allies destroyed them. Tonight, Mr. Perricos said he did not believe the press reports that Iraq had enriched nearly 90 pounds of uranium up to weapons-grade level. **********The United Nations inspectors discovered that one of the installations bombed by the allies -- at Tarmia about 30 miles from Baghdad -- was an enrichment plant using electromagnetic technology and was about six months from becoming operational. **********It was equipped with some 30 calutron machines used for enriching uranium. The machines, all of which were damaged by the raid, were spotted by the inspectors being removed from the plant on trucks and were subsequently buried at sites around the country. **********Iraq has now dug up the remnants and showed them to the inspectors. \"They were trying to hide the evidence,\" an official said. **********Iraqi nuclear officials have told the inspectors that Baghdad has tried to keep its enrichment program secret because it was afraid that Israel would bomb the plants otherwise.

He played dead. **********\"I heard one of the white policemen ask another whether I was in fact dead,\" Sibusiso Malinga said later in an affadavit. \"Upon receiving an affirmative answer, they left me and walked away.\"  Collusion Is Charged **********Sibusiso, Zachariah and their older brother, Philemon, 29, said the attack was carried out by local members of the Inkatha Freedom Party and the South African police. The Malinga brothers' version of events is widely believed among the 2,000 residents of this poor, tin-roofed township surrounded by the flat cornfields of eastern Transvaal province. **********The African National Congress charges that what happened in Kwadela is part of a pattern of collusion between the police and the Zulu-based Inkatha movement in rural black communities where the congress is expanding its membership. **********Inkatha is a bitter rival of the African National Congress, the leading black political movement challenging white-minority rule in South Africa. Allegations that Inkatha colludes with the police arise often enough in the Transvaal and Natal but are seldom conclusively proven. **********In Kwadela, at least nine victims have come forward to name their assailants, sometimes the same ones. They explained in detail how they were attacked, though often they were not sure why.  'The Only Reason' **********\"The only reason I can give you is that they were members of the A.N.C.,\" said Jeremiah Mashinini, a 59-year-old schoolteacher who is chairman of the congress's branch in Kwadela. **********\"There's a lot of that in the eastern Transvaal -- attacks by unknown elements in the awkward hours of the night,\" said Jackson Mthembu, the congress's spokesman in the eastern Transvaal. **********The attacks in Kwadela point to another factor in the politically motivated violence inhibiting change in South Africa. The congress and allied local civic associations regard members of black township councils as collaborators with apartheid and demand that they resign. They want the township councils replaced by unified administrations under which affluent white towns would share tax revenue with their impoverished black neighbors. **********Mr. Mashinini said the trouble started with a rent boycott by township residents last year to force Kwadela's Mayor, Napoleon Mkhonza, and five other council members to step down. Three of the council members obliged; the others refused to quit. **********\"The A.N.C. doesn't want any other party to be present,\" Mr. Mkhonza said. \"They want it to be an A.N.C. area. That's the long and short of it.\" **********Like other councilmen seeking political protection, Mr. Mkhonza joined the Inkatha movement, which is recruiting beyond its traditional Zulu base in Natal. Now, he said, \"I am the leader of Inkatha in this area.\" **********The Mayor spoke of attempts to torch or vandalize the homes of council members. But Mr. Mthembu, the congress's spokesman in the region, said he saw Mr. Mkhonza shoot a woman in Kwadela last year.  'Just Another Name' **********Mayor Mkhonza has brought in a dozen young men from the nearby town of Ermelo to protect him. Mr. Mashinini and other residents said the armed youths came from a gang called the Black Cats, which had terrorized the region earlier. **********\"It is just another name -- Black Cats,\" he said. \"They are Inkatha members from Ermelo.\" **********Mr. Mthembu disagreed. \"Inkatha had no presence in the eastern Transvaal until the notorious gang called the Black Cats decided to call themselves Inkatha members,\" he said. **********While Mr. Mashinini was attending the congress's conference in Durban early in July, the house of his son Humphrey and daughter-in-law Julia was firebombed. The couple tried to run out the front door, but shots drove them back into the flames. Julia Mashinini, who was seven months' pregnant, died of burns 17 days later. Humphrey Mashinini remains in the hospital. **********\"They just went for them,\" said Mrs. Mashinini's brother, Victor Nkosi. \"I think one of the causes is that they were A.N.C.\"  Attacks and Retaliation **********Elias Nkosi, an unemployed laborer, said his house was also burned down, as was that of John Blose. Both are active in the congress's Kwadela branch. **********\"Most of the people here are A.N.C.,\" Mr. Nkosi said. \"That's why they had to go to fetch people from outside to attack the A.N.C. here.\" **********On July 26, the night before Mrs. Mashinini's funeral, the Malingas' house was attacked. Congress supporters retaliated by burning down at least three shacks occupied by Inkatha members. **********Philemon Malinga, who hid in the bathroom during the attack on his house, said in his affidavit that \"I heard someone say, 'Let us go, we are finished.' \" He said he saw five men, including a white policeman, climb into an armored car and leave. He identified each one by name. **********Responding to a request for comment, the South African police rejected what it called \"allegations and insinuations\" that officers participated in attacks on houses in Kwadela. A police statement said Mrs. Malinga had been stabbed and that the autopsy found no gunshot wounds. It also said one policeman had rescued a retarded youth from the burning Malinga home.  Police Role Debated **********The Mayor, who lives two doors from the Malinga home, said the police were there to clear a path for the ambulance. But some other residents contend that the police, who are based a block away, assisted the attack. **********Mayor Mkhonza said the African National Congress had rebuffed his efforts to negotiate a truce. **********Mr. Mashinini, who has taught in Kwadela for 24 years, said school attendance had dropped as parents sent their children to stay with relatives elsewhere. People are now afraid to join the African National Congress, he said, and some leave their dwellings at night to sleep in the surrounding fields. **********\"My children don't sleep here because they fear they will be attacked by Inkatha,\" he said. \"I'm the only one who sleeps here because I can't leave my property alone.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/business/markets-day-of-wide-swings-oil-prices-fluctuate-wildly-then-settle-just-9-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1991-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Then Settle Just 9\u00a6 Higher", "print_headline": "MARKETS' DAY OF WIDE SWINGS; Oil Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Then Settle Just 9\u00a6 Higher", "body_text": " **********Oil prices took a wild ride yesterday but came to rest just about where they started. When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced his disappointing news in Geneva just before 2 P.M., the price jumped nearly 30 percent in five minutes, rushing from $24 a barrel to $31. **********It was the widest price swing within one day's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange since trading in crude oil began in March 1983. **********Worldwide, the price bounced throughout the day. Early in the morning, before futures trading opened in New York at 9:45, prices in this country and in London were slightly higher because of fears that war was likely. But then the meeting between Mr. Baker and Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, lasted longer than the market had expected, with reports of progress. Suddenly traders were afraid of holding oil or contracts for oil that would lose value because of peace. **********Then came word, which proved incorrect, that the two men would hold a joint news conference, and the market went lower, expecting an agreement. But when Mr. Baker said the talks had been inconclusive, \"the market exploded,\" said Richard D. Donovan, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers. Traders became convinced that the oil or contracts they had sold in the morning would be worth much more later on because of war, and they all turned to buy. **********\"It's staggering,\" said Mr. Donovan, who pointed out that oil is the world's biggest commodity. Describing what a move that size would mean on other markets, he said, \"Can you imagine the Dow Jones going up 750 points in five minutes? Or gold going up $100?\" **********Theodore R. Eck, chief economist at Amoco, called the jump \"phenomenal.\" **********\"It just tells us there's extreme uncertainty and the folly of trying to forecast prices,\" he said. **********Despite the size of the trading range, $7.65, the day ended with crude for February delivery up only 9 cents, at $27.26 a barrel. The surge had been preceded by a huge selloff, and the market, which frequently overshoots its mark, fell back after reaching its peak. **********The record change in closing price from one day's session to the next is $5.41, set last Oct. 22.

Beutel, said, \"The thing that has made this market so volatile is the black-and-white nature of the negotiations.\" Mr. Beutel, who is with the Pegasus Econometric Group, said, \"There was no place to be in a middle ground.\" **********But other market-watchers said there was meaning to be gleaned from the fact that the swing was not even larger. At the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting group, J. Robinson West, the president, said, \"Although we may be closer to war, timewise and in terms of options, the price was $10 lower than the peak reached earlier.\" **********The reason, he said, was that the trading yesterday \"was not an international economic panic, just a traders' panic.\" When prices peaked above $40 a barrel in October, he said, \"all eyes realized that there was a quantum change in trading oil, the fundamental commodity of international trade.\" This time, he said, it was \"traders watching short-term spikes.\" **********Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst at the same company, said that if peace actually prevailed, prices would decline below yesterday's $24, and if war came, they would rise above $31. **********This is not the first instance of a huge increase in the price of oil, but the market yesterday was substantially different from the last two crises -- during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 and following the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. This price revolution is televised, on thousands of monitor screens around the world, making the volatility far more obvious and inviting participants -- oil producers, oil users and speculators -- to join in, perhaps driving the changes even further. **********But the market is working well, said Nachama Jacobovitz, a spokeswoman for the exchange.

So Israel will act in its own time, they said -- certainly not until Wednesday and perhaps not even until Sunday, when the full Cabinet is scheduled to meet next. **********That would not leave much time before negotiators are supposed to be in Washington to pick up where they left off in Madrid three weeks ago in their direct talks with delegations from Syria and Lebanon and a joint team of Jordanians and Palestinians. **********For all that, there seemed little question that Israel will eventually say yes, as Jordan and Lebanon already have. And if Lebanon goes to Washington, it is presumably only because its chief patron, Syria, plans to attend as well. Palestinian leaders in Israeli-held territories say they are also disposed to go but first want to clear up questions about American visas for their representatives. **********While the Israelis in their hesitation have focused almost exclusively on issues of form -- the where, when and how of negotiations -- they insist that these matters bear substantive implications. **********Above all, a senior official said, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is \"very, very determined\" to have the talks moved quickly to the Middle East, or at least to a nearby site like Cyprus. Therefore, he said, the goal is to have at most a session or two in Washington, and at that the discussions should be focused not on pivotal matters of land and peace but rather on more mundane questions about how to proceed next. **********The newspaper Haaretz reported today that the Israeli Government also wants to make sure that its Washington meetings with various Arab delegations do not take place at the same time or in the same place, to avoid even the appearance that a regional peace conference is under way, with Israel sitting alone among the Arabs. **********But the desire to dwell for now on procedure instead of substance could run afoul of the Bush Administration, which hopes to give a kick-start to discussions on the real issues dividing Israel and its neighbors. **********According to the Israeli press, the letters of invitation sent by the United States last week to the parties included proposals on central matters like the Golan Heights, the self-declared Israeli security zone in southern Lebanon and Palestinian autonomy in Israeli-occupied territories. **********For instance, the Americans reportedly recommended that Israel determine that it would withdraw from the Golan Heights in exchange for a peace treaty with Syria. They also were said to have proposed that the Israelis and Palestinians each suggest a model for Palestinian self-rule but that they delay discussions of issues that could become stumbling blocks, such as who will control land and water resources.  Intervention by Bush **********To the Israelis, form is intertwined with substance because they fret that what the Arabs really want is to deadlock the talks and have the Americans impose a settlement. According to their argument, designating Washington as a permanent site for negotiations would make it relatively easy for President Bush at some point to intervene, personally and dramatically. **********Such a solution, it is further argued, is not likely to favor Israel. **********American impartiality in the Middle East has been openly questioned by Mr. Shamir and many of his Cabinet ministers ever since the peace process moved into high gear last summer. A series of clashes in recent months have soured relations with Washington. **********And although Israeli concerns have hardly been ignored, there is a restiveness within the Government here that the United States has a foot in the Arab camp, or at least a couple of toes.  Israeli Feelings Bruised **********Those bruised feelings deepened after the State Department sent out its invitations to come to Washington only hours before Mr. Shamir called on Mr. Bush at the White House. This was seen by many Israelis as humiliating treatment of their national leader, and a senior aide to Mr. Shamir said that he found the anti-Washington resentments to be running surprisingly high. **********Criticism of recent American behavior has come from all political corners, including people who strongly disapprove of Mr. Shamir. But there are also many Israelis who say that the United States had to take decisive, perhaps even rude, action to get the talks going again; otherwise, they argue, Mr. Shamir would pile one delay atop another. **********\"On the record?\" an opposition member of Parliament said. \"It's horrible what the Americans did.

We believe Prince Sihanouk is a man of peace.\" Looking to Peace **********The Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, an ancient city of gentle, faded beauty that has known little in recent years but brutal oppression or civil war, is finally allowing itself to consider the possibility that peace has arrived, and that it could last. **********On Thursday, Prince Sihanouk, who ruled this country before his overthrow in 1970, and has been in exile for all but a few years since, is to return to Phnom Penh. The event will mark the formation of a national reconciliation council led by Prince Sihanouk that will help run the country in consultation with the United Nations until free elections are held in 1993 under a peace accord signed in Paris last month. **********This week, for the first time since Phnom Penh was overrun -- and emptied -- by the Communist Khmer Rouge 16 years ago, the Cambodian capital is bustling with diplomats and journalists who have come here not to track the battles, but to assess the peace. **********The guerrilla fighters are on their way home, as well. Leaders of the American-backed Khmer People's National Liberation Front, one of four factions that will share power in the new government, landed at the city's international airport today to join in the celebrations. 'Happy to Be Home' **********\"We are very happy to be home,\" said the rebel group's chief of cabinet, Pen Thol, who had not been in the capital, his home, in 16 years. **********The biggest crowds in Phnom Penh this week have been in front of a modern whitewashed villa a few blocks from the languorous Tonle Sap River, where about 40 Australian soldiers working as United Nations peacekeeping troops have set up heir headquarters. **********\"It makes me feel relief,\" said Pan Tao, a cook who had come with her seven-year-old son to watch the high-spirited Australians in their green jungle fatigues unload trucks of communications gear they will use to monitor the cease-fire. \"We now have soldiers of peace, and that is better.\" **********The preparations to welcome Prince Sihanouk home are in evidence everywhere in the city, from the last dabs of ochre paint applied to the newly renovated royal palace to the two-story-high portraits of the Prince that are being readied for the airport and the main thoroughfare into the city. **********The five Sihanouk billboards have drawn much comment because they are based on a quite flattering photograph that is at least 15 years old. 'Welcome the Prince Home' **********\"I know that the Prince now has gray hair, not black hair, but this is the photograph that the Ministry of Culture wants us to use,\" said Le Ly, a 45-year-old billboard painter who stood atop wooden scaffolding along the roadway to paint the left eyebrow on the mercurial Prince. **********\"It does not matter,\" he said, pushing back his wide-brimmed straw hat and grinning. \"We will welcome the Prince home no matter what color his hair is. The Prince must come back so there will be peace.\" **********While Prince Sihanouk has long been in exile -- from 1970 to 1975, and again since 1979, when he was allowed to flee to China ahead of advancing Vietnamese troops -- the Prince still evokes strong and to a large degree affectionate memories among the residents of Phnom Penh. **********There is some bitterness about Prince Sihanouk's willingness to make peace with the Khmer Rouge, and lingering resentment of his association with the fanatical group in the early 1970's; he served briefly as a figurehead under the Khmer Rouge when it came to power in 1975, before quickly falling out of favor and being placed under house arrest for several years. **********But the so-called changeling Prince, now 69 years old, is seen as the one Cambodian who might be able to unify the nation and to bring about a stable peace. Khmer Rouge Also Returning **********\"I am proud to do this painting of a man of peace,\" said Keo Ty, another of the billboard painters. \"It is a happy time for all Cambodians.\" **********Even as the people of Phnom Penh ready themselves for the return of the prince, their exhilaration is tempered by the knowledge that the dreaded Khmer Rouge will soon return to the capital as well. **********Under the United Nations peace accord, the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful guerrilla faction in the long Cambodian civil war, is part of the coalition government and will be permitted to put forward candidates in the national election. **********During its four-year reign, which ended with a Vietnamese invasion in 1978, the Khmer Rouge pursued a radical, peasant-driven collectivist revolution and in the process presided over the deaths of more than one million Cambodians by execution, starvation or disease. **********Many residents of Phnom Penh think the Khmer Rouge and its paramount leader, Pol Pot, are capable of doing it all over again. Western diplomats reported over the weekend that the Khmer Rouge, in violation of the peace accord, is hiding troops and huge cache of weapons in the mountains for a possible return to armed conflict. Enraged by Khmer Rouge **********\"When the Pol Potists come back to Phnom Penh, I do not know what I will do,\" said Ros Sophal, a 34-year-old dancer in the classical dance troupe that will be performing for the Prince on Sunday. \"If I could get near them, I would hit them. I would hurt them.\" **********Mrs. Ros Sophal has reason to be enraged. Her husband, a young soldier in the American-backed Government of Premier Lon Nol, was executed by the Khmer Rouge, as were several other relatives. **********When Phnom Penh was emptied by the Khmer Rouge days after they took the city in 1975, she was forced into the countryside, where, like millions of other Cambodians, Mrs. Ros Sophal was required to work in the fields day and night for the sake of the Khmer Rouge revolution. \"We would begin at 4 o'clock in he morning and we would work until midnight,\" she said. \"Every day. For years.\" **********There was also the fear, she said, that the Khmer Rouge would learn that she had been trained as a classical dancer -- often a capital offense under a government that saw Khmer dance as a vestige of the old decadence. **********Toni Shapiro, a 34-year-old Cornell University doctoral student in anthropology who has been in Cambodia for more than a year studying Khmer dance, said that 90 percent of all of Cambodia's classical dancers and other professional artists are believed to have been killed during the Khmer Rouge era. **********\"Not a day goes by here when somebody doesn't mention something about the Khmer Rouge and about their relatives who were killed by the Khmer Rouge,\" she said as she watched the national troupe rehearse for its Sunday performance for the Prince. \"I see the tears everyday.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/24/business/wall-street-off-the-beaten-bankruptcy-path.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1005, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; Off the Beaten Bankruptcy Path", "print_headline": "Wall Street; Off the Beaten Bankruptcy Path", "body_text": " **********John C. Boland, a former newspaperman, labors over his computer keyboard in a brick garret whose walls are lined with vintage paperback mystery novels, while tea cools in a lumpy pottery mug and four cats (one named Mouse) grumble in the cozy kitchen two floors below. **********The result of all this homespun activity is Bankruptcy Values, one of the quirkiest institutional newsletters in the burgeoning field of bankruptcy investing. **********Let others on Wall Street huff and puff over the prospect of investing in well-worn bankruptcies like Continental Holdings or Revco. As editor and publisher of Bankruptcy Values, Mr. Boland travels off the beaten path, seeking old-fashioned bargains among the most obscure veterans of Chapter 11. \"I take a rigid value approach,\" he said, after hushing the cats and fielding the phone. \"In fact, the popularity of a situation is a sure sign to me that it's getting dangerous.\" **********And those signs are proliferating sharply these days, Mr. Boland warns, as more Wall Street players flock to the distressed securities game. \"The business is attracting a lot of people whose very presence is lowering the returns. This business is a seesaw -- and we are in a terrible swing downward right now.\" **********Some of the companies Mr. Boland follows, while hardly household names, have had spectacular recoveries after leaving Chapter 11. He was an early investor in the various securities of the Todd Shipyards Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1987 and emerged on Jan. 22 in reorganized form. As the company cleared the courthouse door, Mr. Boland continued to recommend its stock, which was trading around $4 a share. But the shares have traded as high as $5.875 in recent weeks, and Mr. Boland said last week that he now thinks they are a trifle expensive. \"I wouldn't be an aggressive buyer here, unless I knew something was up,\" he said. \"And I don't.\" **********There have been duds in Mr. Boland's portfolio, too -- companies that went from obscurity to oblivion. \"This is a business where there is so much risk in everything you do that you have to be prepared to look like a fool for a long time before something works,\" he said. \"And sometimes, you just stop and try something else.\" **********In some ways, that is how Mr. Boland came to be producing Bankruptcy Values. An editor at the Baltimore Sun and then a senior editor at Barron's, he struck off on his own in 1983. First came a book on Wall Street personalities, and then his first newsletter, Value Investing in Special Situations. Through it all, he managed to work primarily from his attic office in the narrow brick townhouse he bought nearly 20 years ago in Baltimore's Fells Point section. **********After the 1987 crash, Mr. Boland scrapped his first newsletter and focused on Bankruptcy Values. But his latest picks have already left bankruptcy behind. That's where the values are, he said. **********Unfortunately, many of his favorites are low-priced and volatile stocks that trade infrequently and are largely ignored by analysts. Acknowledging those risks, Mr. Boland insists on an extremely diverse portfolio and does a lot of first-hand, albeit reluctant, research. He shuddered as he described a trip through the Nevada sandscape to check out the Mego Corporation, a recent pick. **********But the trip confirmed that Mego, the successor to a bankrupt toy manufacturer, is \"a real company, with real assets and real earnings.\" And real glitter, too: Mego's chairman and one of its large shareholders is Robert Nederlander of the Nederlander Group, whose investments include a big chunk of the Great White Way and the New York Yankees. Another big investor and board member is Wilbur L. Ross of Rothschild Inc., one of the best-known creditor negotiators in the bankruptcy game. With the company's share price roughly equal to its earnings, and considerably lower than book value, Mr. Boland has been buying the stock and advising clients to do likewise. **********Mr. Boland is also recommending a casino company, the Elsinore Corporation, whose tattered past includes ownership of the failed Atlantis casino in Atlantic City. The company's chief asset now is the dowdy Four Queens casino in Las Vegas, but Mr. Boland thinks aggressive management could spruce up the share price considerably. **********That happy prospect seemed likely last year when Elsinore caught the eye of Harold Goldsmith, the co-founder of Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, the retail clothing chain. After acquiring nearly 20 percent of Elsinore, Mr. Goldsmith announced in January that he planned to seek control. But on Feb. 13, he was killed in the crash of a chartered jet approaching the Aspen, Colo., airport. **********That tragedy raises a host of uncertainties for Elsinore, Mr. Boland said. \"The main question now is where his Elsinore shares will go.\" He added: \"In aggressive hands, it could be positive. And the stock is very cheap on a cash-flow basis, so I'll stay with it and wait for a spark. But there aren't many Harold Goldsmiths around.\" **********The management factor also figures in Mr. Boland's view of the Texscan Corporation of El Paso, a cable television equipment manufacturer. Mr. Boland recommended the stock last summer but grew cautious last month when William H. Lambert, the company's chairman, proposed a management buyout. No price has been disclosed, he noted, although the company's shares have climbed to nearly $8, from around $6. \"It's an arbitrager's business from $8 on,\" he said. \"I've been a seller at these prices.\" **********Mr. Boland doesn't spend all his time poring through corporate casualty lists. He travels with his wife, Miga -- to his astonishment, he loved Paris, he says. He fusses with the lawyer next door over the backyard landscaping. And somehow, between bankruptcies, he finds time to write mystery novels. His latest, due out soon from St. Martin's Press, is set on Wall Street but is obviously    not    autobiographical: it is called \"Easy Money.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/13/business/company-news-new-ntt-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New N.T.T.

The reports are intended to appeal to socially conscious investors and to encourage companies to minimize pollution. **********The council's reports are part of a growing effort by public interest and environmental groups to examine and publish analyses of the vast amounts of environmental data that the Government has required companies to file in recent years. Early next year, the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based organization that conducts investment research for university endowments and pension funds, will publish statistical summaries of the environmental performance of all 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index. **********Both organizations sell their research, but are operated on a nonprofit basis. **********While not refuting many of the specific statements in the council reports, the companies contend that the documents distort their environmental performance by dwelling largely on past problems. **********Other groups are digging into environmental data as well. Friends of the Earth, for instance, issued a critical 112-page study of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company's environmental performance in August in response to television advertisements the company has run that depict animals applauding Du Pont's decision to use double-hull oil tankers. The group said the Du Pont study was the first of a series of reports on what it calls \"corporate environmentalism.\" **********The new reports come in addition to the annual compilations of toxic emissions issued by Citizens Fund, another public advocacy group. **********Industrial companies are required by the Government to report their emission levels for several hundred chemicals believed to be toxic, even if the emissions are within permitted limits. Citizen Fund aggregates the plant-by-plant data submitted by the companies and characterizes the chemical as acutely toxic, cancer causing or linked to birth defects. Since the data were first published three years ago, many major corporations, including Du Pont, Mobil and the Monsanto Company, have announced programs to cut their emissions sharply. **********Some officials of environmental groups have said that publication of the toxic emission data has had a more powerful effect on reducing pollution than 20 years of regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency. William Reilly, the administrator of E.P.A., described the data as \"one of the most important tools we have to reduce toxic emissions.\"  Range of Environmental Criteria **********The new reports go beyond toxic emissions to look into data concerning E.P.A. enforcement actions and fines paid, Superfund liabilities reported in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and published accounts of environmentally related incidents. Alice Tepper Marlin, the director of the Council on Economic Priorities, said the reports came in response to requests by users of the group's other research services. **********\"The environment has emerged as the No. 1 concern with much of our audience,\" she said. The group also publishes \"Shopping for a Better World\" and \"The Better World Investment Guide,\" both of which rank companies on a variety of social criteria, including advancement of women and minorities, animal testing and charitable giving. **********Margaret Carroll, executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, said investors were beginning to realize that sloppy environmental policies could hamper the financial performance of companies. \"This is not so much a moral or ethical issue as one that potentially affects the bottom line,\" she said. \"There may be indications in the data of future liabilities.\" **********One example, said Scott Fenn, another official of Investor Responsibility, is Superfund liabilities. Legally, each company involved in a site is liable for the complete cost of cleanup, although in practice the cost is usually spread among several companies. **********Knowing that one company has dozens of Superfund liabilities and has paid large fines for environmental violations could help an investment manager evaluate it against another that has little liability and few fines. **********Ms. Tepper Marlin said the 35 companies covered in the first set of reports were given an opportunity to review the findings and supply additional material.  Mobil's Protest **********A sampling of the companies involved indicates they are uncomfortable with the council's analysis, even when some of their responses are included in final drafts. In a letter to Jonathan Schorsch, the council's project director, Mobil described its profile as \"incomplete and unwarranted.\" **********In particular, the company objected to the council's use of published accounts of environmental incidents without any effort to check the underlying facts. \"Conclusions reached in the profile appear to be based, at least in part, upon a combination of limited factual information and unproven newspaper allegations, media perceptions and incomplete reports,\" the company said in a six-page letter to the council. **********At Amoco, Walter R. Quanstrom, the vice president for environmental affairs and safety, \"commended\" the group for including many of the company's comments, but questioned what he called a misplaced emphasis on a small subsidiary. **********Mr. Quanstrom said it was true that the company's Waste-Tech Services unit opened negotiations with some Indian groups about building incinerators on their land, but said the company backed away from the proposal and none was actually built. **********\"Waste Tech represents less than one one-hundredth of Amoco's revenues, but they have a whole page on it,\" Mr. Quanstrom said. \"I think that is a wee bit overplayed.\" **********Mr. Quanstrom of Amoco said he had observed a trend toward measuring the environmental performance of companies much the way financial performance has long been analyzed. \"I think what we're going to do is develop some rules,\" he said, \"so that apples are measured against apples.\" **********Charlotte Cuff, public affairs director for American Cynamid, said that the council had not used most of the material her company provided in support of its position and that the council added allegations after the company reviewed an early draft. The report, she said, \"should have little credibility as a source of information.\" **********The Council on Economic Priorities plans to profile an aditional 100 companies next year and plans to be monitoring 500 by 1996. The individual reports are available on a sliding- fee scale ranging from $20 for individuals and small nonprofit institutions to $100 for corporations. **********The Investor Responsibility Research Center, in contrast to the 20- to 50-page reports issued by the council, confines its statistical summaries to two pages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/03/business/business-technology-for-shakespeare-just-log-on.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1991-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Shakespeare, Just Log On", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; For Shakespeare, Just Log On", "body_text": " **********The development of a nationwide data network will allow personal computer users to tap sources as large as the Library of Congress or receive their own personalized electronic newspapers. **********Several innovations, taken together, have already demonstrated that searching vast computer data bases can be easier than consulting a card catalogue, and not nearly as difficult or expensive as computer searches are today. Computer users might read some Dickens more readily than they could check out David Copperfield from the local library. **********Those in the industry say that users with little computer skills will soon be able to search through several terabytes of information, or several trillion characters of text, in seconds. The Library of Congress, with 80 million items, contains an estimated 25 terabytes of information. **********Already, an experimental computer library has linked 150 universities to 40 sources of information, ranging from National Institutes of Health data to corporate documents and Shakespeare's plays. New software allows users to browse or zero in on particular information. **********As methods of retrieving information are standardized and perfected, industry executives and computer scientists say, thousands of new services, ranging from electronic newspapers to the computer equivalent of free public libraries, will blossom. \"Everyone is realizing how important it is to get into the mass market for information,\" said Thomas Koulopoulos, president of Delphi Consulting Group, a Boston market research firm. **********Such ready access to huge amounts of computerized information has been the dream of many in the industry. But a lack of computing power, effective software and high-speed digital networks has stalled progess until recently. **********If many of the technical problems are being solved, major business and political disputes remain. The researchers acknowledge that they must resolve several questions of privacy and pricing before they can put the new methods to commercial use. **********Many sources of information, like government documents, might be available free, but other services, including electronic newspapers, will be available only to those who pay. The industry has yet to settle on ways to protect and charge for intellectual property in a computer network where information can be copied instantly. But to encourage progress, the Thinking Machines Corporation, a Cambridge, Mass., supercomputer manufacturer, has made its software available at no charge. **********Some industry enthusiasts say the new technology will transform the way computerized information is sold. Mitchell Kapor, the founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, predicts the growth of a new industry as significant as the personal computer business. Some companies, like the Dow Jones Corporation, that already provide computerized information over telephone lines have taken part in developing the new computer library.  The Search Is Simplified **********In 1989, Thinking Machines enlisted the support of Dow Jones, Apple Computer Inc. and the KPMG Peat Marwick accounting and consulting firm to design the computer library, called Wide Area Information Servers, or WAIS (pronounced ways). The system permits computer users to quickly search through a huge volume of information even if it is stored at several distant locations. **********The system lets users conduct searches by typing common English phrases instead of more complicated computer commands. While current systems like Dialog and Nexis require users to specify precisely the information they want, the new system can respond to a user's inferences. It initially presents a sample list of documents. The user chooses one or several, and then a \"relevance feedback\" program presents other documents most like the ones selected. **********\"This solves the problem of how to get to the information you need, getting not too much and not too little,\" said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a computer industry newsletter. **********This is a sharp contrast to the way services operate today, Ms. Dyson said. A computer user may need to call seven or eight separate data bases depending on the kind of information needed. **********The WAIS system lets users of Apple personal computers harness a network of Thinking Machines supercomputers and smaller \"server\" computers to search data bases stored by Dow Jones, KPMG and several corporations and universities. Users can also read electronic mail, enter their corporate electronic libraries and summon up a wide variety of documents, newspapers and magazines. A 'Corporate Memory' **********At Thinking Machines, the WAIS system serves as a \"corporate memory,\" allowing employees to retrieve memos, documents and other internal information. Employees who may not be working together can share expertise. **********\"If someone did something in Los Angeles and I'm sitting in San Francisco, I may not know about the work,\" said Robin Palmer, a senior manager at Peat Marwick. **********WAIS delivers information over the Internet, a collection of 2,600 high-speed public and private computer networks. This Government-sponsored system of data highways is rapidly being improved and turned to commercial uses. **********The market for software that allows the rapid retrieval of computerized text is small but growing, according to industry analysts. In 1989, the United States had fewer than 60,000 users; by the next year, total sales were about $120 million. The Delphi Consulting Group expects the market to grow to 160,000 users and $235 million by 1992. **********\"Information retrieval technology is starting to spread from supercomputers all the way down to personal computers,\" said Brewster Kahle, a Thinking Machines scientist who has led the WAIS experiment. **********The WAIS system is built on a procedure for retrieving information developed by librarians who initially set out to computerize their card catalogues. The procedure -- known in the field as Z39.50 -- now has the support of the Library of Congress, Apple, Sun Microsytems Inc., Next Inc., Dow Jones and Mead Data Central. **********In the future, a special directory or \"white pages\" will keep an up-to-date list of all the separate sources on the network. **********Apple has its own electronic library project, borrowing its name, Rosebud, from the movie \"Citizen Kane.\" The three-year-old project is based on the WAIS system, but adds features including the ability for a user to develop a personalized electronic newspaper. **********Rosebud uses special programs -- called \"reporters\" -- that let customers specify the kinds of information and news they want to retrieve from the WAIS system every day. Researchers at Apple's Advanced Technology Group said that in the future the necessary retrieval software might be a standard part of a computer's operating system. **********They expect improvements in the Internet computer network to greatly lower the cost of information searches, promoting the introduction of many new services. The Government proposes to expand and improve Internet by financing a National Research and Education Network, or NREN, that could extend a high-speed computer links into schools and communities across the country. **********\"With things like NREN, everthing could change overnight,\" said Tim Oren, an Apple researcher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/world/algeria-s-islamic-front-meets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Algeria's Islamic Front Meets", "print_headline": "Algeria's Islamic Front Meets", "body_text": " **********The Muslim fundamentalist opposition party, the Islamic Salvation Front, meeting for the first time since the Government cracked down on it in early June, today demanded the release of its jailed leaders and an end to a state of emergency.

Invitation to Leave **********This restlessness attracted at least semi-official attention last week when a magazine called Babil -- the Arabic for Babylon -- that is owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Udai, published an article suggesting that those disloyal enough to want to leave should do so now. Good riddance to them was the implication. **********The article never mentioned Iraq's Christians by name.

And some Christians fear discrimination against minorities if conditions worsen. Hurt by Economic Slowdown **********Some Christians say the postwar economic slowdown is already hitting them hard. Often better educated than Muslims and fluent in English or French, many had taken jobs with foreign concerns that have now departed or at embassies that are closed. **********Past waves of immigration also mean that Iraqi Christians often have relatives in countries like the United States, Australia and Canada who can help them start a new life abroad.

OPEC oil has fallen to $17.74 a barrel on average, in part because of the allies' quick success in the war against Iraq. **********OPEC's Secretary General, Subroto, announced the group's decision at 7 P.M. here, and afterward crude oil for delivery in April rose 69 cents a barrel to settle at $19.68 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. When OPEC oil is trading at $21 a barrel, higher-quality West Texas oil costs $23.  [ Page D17 ] .  More Power for Saudis **********OPEC officials and oil analysts here said today's decision reflected the Saudis' increased power within the group after the defeat of Iraq by Riyadh and its allies. How the agreement will affect oil prices was unclear, with oil experts and even OPEC ministers disagreeing among themselves about whether the cuts were large enough to raise prices. **********After today's meeting, production of the 13-member group, currently estimated at 23.4 million barrels a day, would fall to 22.3 million barrels if members adhered to the agreement. **********Saudi Arabia, by far the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stubbornly resisted some other members' pleas for the group to cut production by 2 million barrels a day, with the Saudis absorbing 1.3 million barrels in cuts. Those members contended that the larger cuts were needed to bring prices back to $21 for a \"basket\" of seven OPEC crudes. **********Under today's agreement, Saudi Arabia is expected to produce 8 million barrels a day, down from the 8.45 million barrels that Riyadh says it has produced in recent days, but far more than the 5.4 million barrels it produced under the old OPEC quota, before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. **********Oil experts said the reservations that Iran and Algeria expressed about the plan reflected their belief that OPEC, including Saudi Arabia, should accept far greater production cuts. It also reflected their unhappiness with the way the Saudis were exercising their muscle.   'A Price-Increasing Effect' **********\"All ministers agree that one million barrels per day less than present production will have a price-increasing effect,\" Dr. Subroto said at a news conference. He said he did not know whether the price would increase \"directly to $21,\" but said, \"I'm sure it will go in that direction.\" **********One Iranian official, speaking privately, expressed skepticism that the 5 percent cut in production would firm up oil prices. \"It's not a serious number like the market is expecting,\" he said. **********This morning, before the agreement was announced, Iran's oil minister, Gholam Rezah Aghazadeh, predicted that cutting production to a range of 21 million to 21.5 million barrels a day would raise prices to a range of $18 to $21 a barrel. But he said reducing output to 22 million barrels a day would keep prices between $15 and $18. **********Dr. Subroto said today's agreement called for OPEC members to make \"voluntary\" proportional production cuts of 5 percent. But Algeria's oil minister, Sadek Boussena, who is also OPEC's president, said Algeria would ignore the agreement and would not cut production. **********Some oil experts said the soft nature of today's agreement might lead to overproduction, because OPEC members might not adhere to the 5 percent cuts.  'Prices Will Drop' **********\"I think in the coming weeks prices will drop because people will start to see a glut in the market,\" said Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil journal. **********OPEC officials said they could not specify the exact levels of new production because of the voluntary nature of the agreement and because OPEC had asked members to report within seven days their exact production levels. Oil experts estimated that under the new agreement Saudi Arabia would pump 8 million barrels a day, followed by Iran with 3.2 million barrels, the United Arab Emirates, with 2.3 million, and Venezuela with 2.2 million. **********Oil analysts said one reason it was not hard to persuade members to agree to 5 percent cuts was that even with the reductions many members would be producing well above the quotas set last July. Those quotas were suspended after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the United Nations ordered an embargo on oil from those two countries, which had been producing 4 million barrels a day. OPEC members were encouraged to produce as much as they could to make up for that loss. **********Today's agreement excludes Iraq and Kuwait because OPEC officials expect neither nation to export oil in the second quarter. OPEC will meet again in June to set production levels for the third quarter. **********When the current meeting began on Monday, OPEC's secretariat said demand for OPEC oil would be 21.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, some 2 million barrels below current production levels. But Saudi officials forecast that demand for OPEC oil would be 22.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter. They said increases in oil companies' stocks, a decline in Soviet oil exports and a rebound in the American economy would raise demand for OPEC oil. Saudi Demand Is Met **********Oil officials here said one index of Saudi Arabia's new power was the closeness of the new production level to the estimate for demand by the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer.. Showing new assertiveness, Saudi officials said they would refuse to produce fewer than 8 million barrels a day, and they persuaded other ministers to agree to that. **********The Saudis also got their way in insisting that this week's gathering, a meeting of OPEC's market monitoring committee, not be turned into an emergency full-scale ministers meeting. Saudi officials worried that such a meeting might erupt into a political fight in which a heated debate would develop over future quotas for Iraq and Kuwait. There was also concern that OPEC members would attack one another over their stands in the gulf war. **********One factor that helped Saudi Arabia dominate the meeting was the humbling of Iraq and the absence of Iraqi officials, who had been the intimidating price hawks at previous meetings. **********Saudi officials rejected criticism that they were doing Washington's bidding by pushing for higher production levels and thus lower prices than some members wanted.

Hope and Skepticism **********His was a widely shared opinion here today as Israelis followed the Middle East peace talks with hope but also with skepticism and a cold-eyed conviction that an event is not necessarily impressive just because it is historic. **********It was different for many Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories, which were in effect shut down for a second straight day by a general strike ordered by radical opponents to the Madrid conference and by scattered curfews imposed by the Israeli Army. Unlike previous days this week, though, this one passed with only a smattering of reported violence and casualties from clashes between soldiers and Arabs and between rival Palestinian factions. **********Palestinians have felt shunted to the wings of the world stage for so long that the very fact that they had a representative speaking for them in Madrid sent hundreds of people marching happily through the streets of Ramallah, six miles north of Jerusalem in the West Bank. Some climbed onto army jeeps, and lay olive branches on them. **********They were delighted, they said, with the speech given by the chief Palestinian delegate, Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi. \"He expressed our opinions and spoke of our rights for the first time in more than 40 years,\" Rasmi Matariyeh, a pharmacist, told a Reuters reporter. **********On the western side of the so-called Green Line separating the West Bank from Israel proper, Israelis seemed similarly pleased with their own chief delegate, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, for presenting their case forcefully. **********Even on the political left, where Mr. Shamir's hard-line views are hardly pleasing and where many were disappointed that the Prime Minister offered no conciliatory gestures to the Arabs, there was relief that he at least did not give a lectern-thumping diatribe against territorial concessions or a freeze on Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. Peace Now, a prominent group of anti-settlement campaigners, called his Madrid speech important because \"it left all doors open.\" **********Nevertheless, in this city where the main commodity is memory, serving as both blessing and curse, many Israelis were unpersuaded that much would truly materialize from all the speeches and the reactions and the spin-doctored news conferences of this momentous day. **********\"It's all a show,\" Shira Shelkowitz said from behind the counter of the health-food shop where she works. \"You feel good about it. It's nice to see everybody sitting down together. But it's not the real thing.\" **********The real thing here is not just peace but also territory, and on that score Israelis are as divided as the land itself. **********Not an inch should go back to the Arabs, Ben-Zion Borochoff insisted as he clipped a customer's beard in his barber shop. \"America can't tell us where we settle or not settle,\" he said. \"We don't tell them what to do.\" **********Well, others said, maybe a few inches could go back, maybe the Gaza Strip, which most Israelis feel is not worth owning in the first place. Maybe parts of the West Bank as well, still others suggested. Jacob Stein, for one, said he was certain that a secret deal was already in the works to return parts of the West Bank and the Golan Heights. **********He could live with that, said Mr. Stein, a glassblower. \"But it must be for real peace,\" he insisted. \"To give anything back, we need not just a piece of paper.\"  The Right to Exist **********More than a few people agreed with Mr. Shamir when he said at the Madrid conference that the underlying issue is not territory but the question of a Jewish state's right to exist in an unfriendly neighborhood. **********But the world can change, some said, and that includes hard-nosed attitudes that may seem inflexible. **********Feri Mechabel, a florist who came here from Iran soon after the 1967 Middle East war, remembers that he was little impressed when Mr. Sadat journeyed to Jerusalem 14 years ago, preaching good will and ultimately forging a peace treaty with Prime Minister Menachem Begin in return for getting the Sinai Peninsula back. **********\"I was in the army back then, and I was not ready to give up an inch,\" Mr. Mechabel said, arranging a floral bouquet. Now, he wishes that 1977 could be duplicated, for he is prepared to yield some land, even if he draws the line at East Jerusalem, captured and annexed by Israel in 1967. **********\"There's been a lot of blood since then,\" he said. \"But you can't wash away blood with blood.

Today Abu Abbas, head of the Palestine Liberation Front, called on Palestinians to strike at the interests of the United States and its allies. **********\"Hurry and strike at and destroy the interests of U.S. imperialists and their allies,\" he said in a broadcast over Iraqi radio. **********It was because of such threats, that the F.B.I. rapidly expanded its program in recent weeks. Officials said that the program relies on measures like electronic eavesdropping and other information collected here and abroad on suspected terrorists. **********\"We are doing everything we possibly can to make the environment as hostile as we can,\" a senior Justice Department official said. **********The program also involves seeking out Iraqi nationals who have overstayed their visas and conducting criminal investigations. **********But the F.B.I.'s tactics, including interviews with Arab-American leaders, have inflamed fears that the Justice Department has responded to the crisis by reverting to the style of J.

They said the number of such attacks declined to 5 in 1990, from 25 in 1986. Senior Justice Department officials concede that the threat of terrorism stemming from the conflict with Iraq remains at a \"low level.\" **********But those senior officials said the precautionary measures are necessary. They point to a variety of chilling factors, like Mr. Hussein's statements, the existence of a training camp of the Abu Nidal terrorist organization in Iraq and the recent movements of some members of the Palestine Liberation Organization from their bases in Lebanon and elsewhere to undisclosed locations. **********Terrorism experts said fears are further heightened because support groups of the Abu Nidal group and the P.L.O. are known to exist in the United States. **********Throughout the week, the F.B.I. increased security at its own offices and operated on a \"terrorist advisory,\" which warns of a general possibility that such acts could occur, although there have been no specific threats. **********The bureau also increased security on Capitol Hill. The leadership of Congress and at least six members of the House and Senate have been provided armed guards and other protection after a marked increase in threats of violence against lawmakers, two Congressional officials said today. **********The officials, a member of Congress and an aide, said that F.B.I. agents and the Capitol police force are accompanying the members, most of whom were not identified. **********For the last week, armed guards have been posted at the homes of the congressional leadership, said one official. Shotgun-toting police have been visible in force on the Capitol grounds, and new barricades have been erected at one key entrance to congressional office buildings.   1 KILLED BY TERRORIST BOMB **********MANILA, Jan. 19 (REUTERS) -- An Iraqi man was killed and another man was wounded today when a bomb they were apparently trying to plant at United States offices in Manila, exploded prematurely, the Philippine police said. The attempted attack was believed to be the result of Mr. Hussein's call to carry the gulf war to other parts of the world. **********The Philippine police said the bomb contained 200 pounds of explosives and was probably aimed at a building housing the Thomas Jefferson Library and other American offices. It exploded less than 100 yards from the building.  GREECE EXPELLS IRAQIS **********ATHENS, Jan. 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- Greece expelled four Iraqis to Libya today and arrested five others on suspicion that they were planning terrorist activity, a police spokesman said. The move came with the expulsion of most of the Iraqi diplomats here. **********The spokesman said two of the five Iraqis who were seized were later released, and that the remaining three were to be expelled on Sunday. Also flown out to Libya today were 23 of Iraq's 30 diplomats, who were ordered out of the country by the Government. **********All Western embassies and missions, Greek airports and many foreign businesses are being guarded by armored vehicles and heavily armed police officers, while diplomats and foreign nationals in general have been advised to stay indoors.

American Isuzu Motors is seeking an agency for its car and truck account, valued at $74 million to $100 million, to replace Della Femina, McNamee, which it dismissed Thursday after an 11-year relationship. **********And in the realm of possibility, agency executives say Mazda Motor of America is continuing to plan a luxury car line code-named Pegasus. If that car, which has involved preliminary discussions with agencies, is introduced, it could mean initial annual ad spending of $60 million to $75 million. **********Combined total billings of the three accounts exceed $200 million -- as much as an agency that would rank around 43d among all shops in the United States would have. **********Of course, no one agency could serve all three, given the insurmountable competitive conflicts that would ensue. Yet even singly, the billings at issue are magnetic, especially during a recession that has touched off a feeding frenzy among income-starved agencies for whatever sizable pieces of new business become available. **********Apart from the financial implications, an added draw makes an automotive account attractive to just about every agency without one. Call it the lure of the open road. **********\"A car is one of those things that's bigger than life,\" said Mark Goldstein, president of Earle Palmer Brown Advertising, the Bethesda, Md., agency that is among those identified as being on the long list of Subaru contenders. \"It adds a tremendous cachet to your business. You can park a car in front of your building. You can't park a box of Tide in front of your building.\" **********So overwhelming is the desire for auto business that even allied fields bask in a halo effect. When Avis Car Leasing announced the selection yesterday of six finalists on its $30 million-plus account, now being handled by Backer Spielvogel Bates, Robert Cardillo, vice president of sales and marketing, noted that the car-rental company began its review with a list of 120 agencies. **********Besides Backer, the finalists, all based in New York, are DDB Needham Worldwide, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, FCB/Leber Katz Partners, McCann-Erickson and TBWA Advertising. A decision is expected in mid-June. **********Servicing a car account is \"almost synonymous\" with an agency's being regarded by potential clients and its peers as substantial and significant, said Richard Costello, president of TBWA, which is also considered to be among the ranks of Subaru candidates. **********\"What crystallized it for me was what happened last fall or winter, when we pitched the Nikon account,\" he continued. \"I looked around the room, and there were five of the best agencies: Ammirati & Puris, which has BMW; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, which has Infiniti; Della Femina (Isuzu); Levine, Huntley (Subaru), and TBWA, nothing. I thought, 'Man, we're the best agency in America that doesn't have a car account.' \" And the winner was a car agency, Ammirati. Mr. Costello added, \"With all the nice things that have happened to us over the last few years, the one thing we feel we're missing is the car accunt.\" **********And while the current vehicle sales picture is bleak, automotive accounts remain desirable, Mr. Goldstein said, because, like other marketers, including airlines, restaurant chains, telecommunications outfits and computer makers, \"advertising and promotion are critical to them to market their products, whether we're having boom times or we're in a recession.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/world/tourists-stay-home-blighting-the-caribbean.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1991-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 666, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tourists Stay Home, Blighting the Caribbean", "print_headline": "Tourists Stay Home, Blighting the Caribbean", "body_text": " **********As a glance down any of the nearly empty beaches here attests, these are difficult times for the islands of the Caribbean. **********The region's all-important tourism industry has been left reeling by a dramatic decrease in travel by Americans from causes as diverse as the Persian Gulf war, a global recession and a relatively mild winter in the northeastern United States. **********Workers in travel-related businesses have been laid off or placed on rotating shifts and airlines have slashed faresand concocted other incentives to generate business.

Baker 3d and other members of the Administration have been trying to limit the rearmament of the Middle East in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. **********Administration officials insist the two efforts are not at counterpurposes.  Could Include Third World **********The legislation would establish a pilot program that would guarantee up to $1 billion in commercial bank loans to overseas buyers of military products. The sales are expected to be made largely to members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to Japan, Israel and Australia. Should the President determine it is in the national interest, the program would also be available for \"any other country,\" which would include the third world. **********Backers say the proposal, which the Administration sent to Capitol Hill last week, would merely level the playing field with America's main industrial competitors, most of which have export credit agencies that finance military sales. **********A State Department official, who insisted on anonymity, said the proposal is \"a strictly commercial operation and is to be used only to counter subsidized credit packages from competing countries, like France.\" **********But opponents of the proposal say that by diverting resources that should be concentrated on nonmilitary exports, the program will hurt American competitiveness and encourage poorer countries to spend more money on arms. America's competitiveness will suffer, they say, because there is less of a ripple effect through the economy from arms sales than from, say, advances in consumer electronics.  'Very Wrongheaded' **********Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Matters, called the proposal \"very wrongheaded.\" Arms sales, he said, are \"by their very nature noncommercial and political.\" **********In 1989, the last year for which statistics are available, the United States sold about $10.8 billion worth of major conventional weapons systems abroad. The bulk of these sales went to American allies in NATO. **********The Administration's request that the Export-Import Bank, a Government agency, underwrite the arms sales promises to be hotly debated in Congress. A Pentagon-administered military credit guarantee program was suspended in the late 1970's after too many customers went into arrears. **********With the President's backing, the proposal is expected to pass the Senate. But it will run into stiffer opposition in the House, and at this stage, its fate there cannot be determined. **********Even within the Administration, the proposal produced a debate before the White House decided to proceed. The State Department and the Pentagon supported the change. The principal objections came from some executives of the Export-Import Bank. **********The bank was founded 56 years ago to stimulate trade by providing financing to overseas buyers of American goods at below-market rates. Since 1974, it has had policy of financing only nonmilitary exports.  Would Rescind Ban **********The Administration's proposal would rescind Section 32 of the Arms Export Control Act of 1968, which was enacted after widespread use of the agency as an instrument of \"backdoor financing\" of military sales to Southeast Asian nations during the Vietnam buildup. Section 32 bans the use of Export-Import Bank financing of military sales to developing countries. The White House has proposed that the Export-Import Bank guarantee up to $1 billion of commercial bank loans to the overseas customers of American military contractors. **********Such a sweeping expansion in the scope of Government credit activities for military exports has been vigorously promoted by large military contractors like the United Technologies Corporation, the Raytheon Company and the Martin Marietta Corporation, and the White House has now decided to go along. **********After that decision was made, John D. Macomber, president of the export agency and a friend of President Bush, offered this explanation: \"The central point is that we're going through very difficult times in this country for defense industries. The basic motivation behind this is that the Government recognizes there are some real economic adjustment problems for these companies to go through, and this would be a way for the Government to be of some help.\" He was referring to the budget cutbacks of the last two years. **********Representative Jim Moody, another Wisconsin Democrat, is seeking legislators' signatures on a letter to Secretary Baker, warning that the initiative is \"likely to cost the taxpayer dearly\" and is a \"rather transparent attempt to circumvent the budgetary limitations\" of the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program. **********This program is the main military assistance effort under which the Pentagon in the next fiscal year plans to spend nearly $5 billion in grants and low-interest loans to American allies. Although 50 countries are on the list of recipients, half goes to two, Israel and Egypt.  Opposition From Industry **********The Administration has also been seeking to limit strategic arms in talks with the Soviet Union, and it has proposed restrictions on the sale of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons technology to the third world. The Administration proposal has divided the export community. Most companies whose earnings are primarily from military sales back the proposal. Others, like the Boeing Company and the General Electric Company, which have some military business but far larger nonmilitary operations, have reservations. **********They worry about the crowding out of scarce credit resources, the possibility that separate divisions within companies may have to compete for Export-Import Bank money and an undercutting of political support for the bank if it becomes too strongly identified with military programs. **********\"Boeing recognizes financing support is required for the export of defense products,\" said John F. Hayden, the company's corporate vice president. \"But we question the appropriateness of involving Ex-Im Bank as the mechanism.\" **********He noted that since \"defense products exports are not simply commercial transactions, but involve foreign policy and national security, Boeing feels the Department of State may be the appropriate agency to administer a defense-products export-financing program.\" **********Willard M. Berry, vice president for Congressional affairs at the National Foreign Trade Council, said that before Congress takes up the proposal, \"it is in the interest of all concerned to insure that all alternatives are explored and the pros and cons of each are fully debated.\" **********William F. Paul, senior vice president of United Technologies, said that because the United States could not provide competitive credit terms, his company lost a big Brazilian military helicopter contract to France's Aerospatiale in 1988. **********\"We need a mechanism for financing this kind of defense trade when it's necessary,\" Mr. Paul said. \"Our competitors have access to this sort of facility, and we desperately need it ourselves.\" **********Largely through the efforts of Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, United Technologies, based in Hartford, won legislation last year specifically authorizing the export credit agency, on a one-time basis, to provide loan guarantees for a bid to produce 200 military helicopters jointly with Turkey. United Technologies is competing with French and Italian companies.  Some Risks Involved **********But opponents of the proposal say the Export-Import Bank should not be used to assume the risks of financing military exports and taking the risk of political backlash. **********Albert H. Hamilton, a former government affairs manager for the bank and now senior associate of First Washington Associates, an Arlington, Va., consulting firm, said export credit agencies of other countries have gotten into serious polticial and financial difficulties by supporting exports of military equipment. **********One example is the British agency's backing of military sales to the Kwame Nkrumah Government in Ghana. When that Goverment changed in 1966, its successor sought to repudiate the arms-related debt. **********The new legislative proposal may explain why President Bush during his visit to Ottawa on Wednesday was cool to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's proposals to curb arms sales. **********The President said at a new conference that the destruction of Iraq's military threat gave him hope that there would not be increasing arms sales in the Middle East. But he added: \"That doesn't mean we're going to refuse to sell anything to everybody. We're not going to cut off all weapons sales.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/05/business/equity-issues-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Issues This Week", "print_headline": "Equity Issues This Week", "body_text": " **********The following equity offerings are expected this week: <biAG Services, one million shares (650,000 by the company).

Appointing Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Tietmeyer would be both a tribute to Mr. Schlesinger's role and many years of service, and a strong statement that the Bonn Government and the Bundesbank are in agreement on policy.\" **********The Bundesbank president will be chosen by Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition Government and officially appointed by President Richard von Weizsacker. Mr. Schlesinger's appointment is said to be strongly supported by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, a fellow Bavarian who shares many of Mr. Schlesinger's views on financial matters. **********Mr. Schlesinger has been with the Bundesbank since 1952. He became head of the economics and statistical departments in 1964 and moved up to the board as chief economist in 1972. When Mr. Pohl became president in 1979, Mr. Schlesinger was appointed vice president. In 11 years in that post, Mr. Schlesinger has sometimes been attacked by critics as obsessive and narrow-minded for his belief that squelching inflation must be the primary goal of monetary policy. **********Over the last year, for example, the United States and several Western European nations have been urging Germany to lower its interest rates to stimulate global economic growth. But the Bundesbank has steadfastly refused to lower its two leading interest rates, the discount rate and the Lombard rate, from their current levels of 6.5 percent and 9 percent, respectively. **********Mr. Schlesinger responded to recent cuts in American interest rates by saying they take some pressure off the Bundesbank to raise its key interest rates further. But the lower American rates, he said, do not make it possible for Germany to lower rates, which were increased on Jan. 31 by one-half percentage point each.Personality Contrasts to Pohl's **********While Mr. Pohl is a pragmatist known for his warmth, wit and amiability, Mr. Schlesinger is widely viewed as a somewhat humorless technocrat. An avid mountain climber and skier, he is an economist by training and \"Professor Doktor\" by title. Colleagues say he possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of monetary policy and near-total recall of facts, figures and mathematical formulas. **********Those qualities and Mr. Schlesinger's penchant for giving central bankers from other countries impromptu lectures about the danger of inflation have contributed to the occasional friction between Germany and other leading industrial nations over monetary policy. **********The United States Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, became exasperated in late 1987 when he was Treasury Secretary and the Bundesbank refused to cut interest rates. Mr. Baker publicly accused Mr. Schlesinger of heading a clique of \"rigid monetarists\" who \"find inflation under every rock.\" Mr. Baker also blamed the Bundesbank and Mr. Schlesinger for the stock market collapse of 1987, which came after several rounds of Bundesbank rate increases.Sees Himself as Open and Flexible **********Mr. Schlesinger vehemently denies being the personification of German inflation angst and describes himself as an open and flexible central banker. To answer his critics he merely points to Germany's record of steady, if sometimes unspectacular, economic growth and minimal inflation over the last decade. **********The expected appointment of Mr. Tietmeyer to the post of vice president is also seen as a vote for continuing the Bundesbank's policies. As the Finance Ministry's state secretary for international finance from 1982 to late 1989, he developed a reputation as a tough negotiator and tireless worker. **********In January 1990, Mr. Tietmeyer joined the Bundesbank's board. Chancellor Kohl called him back to Bonn two months later on special assignment as his personal adviser on monetary union with East Germany. **********Despite Mr. Tietmeyer's close links to the Chancellor, he is seen as loyal first and foremost to the Bundesbank and the policies forged by Mr. Schlesinger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/31/business/business-digest-121091.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Digest", "print_headline": "Business Digest", "body_text": " **********Markets **********The stock market's record-breaking rally accelerated, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging 62.39 points to a high of 3,163.91.

Buying Computer Maker In Stock Deal Worth $7.4 Billion", "body_text": " **********After more than five months of stubborn resistance, NCR agreed yesterday to be acquired by A.T.& T. for $7.4 billion worth of A.T.& T. stock. **********The acquisition signals the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's determination to expand beyond telecommunications to compete in computers with giants like NEC and Fujitsu of Japan, Siemens of Germany and I.B.M. **********In starting its quest to buy the NCR Corporation, A.T.& T. was seeking a permanent solution to the problem of its money-losing computer business and hoping to find a way to expand into new markets, ones that increasingly rely on linking computers and communications. Analysts say A.T.& T.'s computer business has lost more than $2 billion in six years. **********NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, grew from the National Cash Register Company (it still makes some cash registers) to become the fifth-largest computer maker in the country. **********When A.T.& T. began its pursuit of NCR in December, many industry observers were surprised that kindly Ma Bell had put on the grim visage of a corporate raider. The hostile bid was another milestone in the transformation of the heavily regulated bureaucratic monopoly that existed before the 1984 court-ordered breakup of the Bell System. **********In recent years, as a more aggressive corporation, A.T.& T. has cut costs and more closely tied executive pay to profit levels. **********Robert E. Allen, the chairman of A.T.& T., said yesterday that with NCR the company would work toward providing \"global computer networks as easy to use and accessible as the telephone network is today.\" **********Jack B. Grubman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said: \"A.T.& T. would like to be a $100 billion company by the end of the decade. They would love to be able to go to the chief executive officer of Nestle and say, 'We will provide you soup to nuts, your entire information network.' \" **********Given that assumption, Mr. Grubman and others say more large deals are likely to follow. \"Over the next decade they will do several more deals of this size or bigger,\" Mr. Grubman said. **********Under the definitive merger agreement, A.T.& T. will exchange $110 worth of its own stock for each NCR share, but on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, NCR's shares closed at just $104, up 50 cents. The difference reflects the fact that investors are expected to have to wait four months for the deal to close. But that price is still more than double the $48 that NCR was trading for a month before A.T T. made its first offer in December. A.T.& T.'s shares slipped 37.5 cents yesterday, to $36.75. **********A.T.& T. dwarfs NCR in size, with 1990 revenues of $37.3 billion, compared with $6.2 billion for NCR. Still, the computer maker will provide A.T.& T. important entries into financial and retail industries. NCR is in the process of introducing a line of \"open system\" computers that are capable of being linked with computers and software made by different manufacturers. **********The merger agreement signed yesterday is subject to the approval of NCR shareholders. The First Bid **********It all started in December, when A.T.& T. offered $90 a share, or $6.1 billion, for NCR. By keeping A.T.& T. at bay during the winter, Charles E. Exley Jr., NCR's chairman, was able to cajole A.T.& T. into paying an additional $1.3 billion. **********\"He has done a lot for shareholders,\" said Don Geogerian, head of research of Dreyfus Management Inc., an institutional stockholder of NCR. **********Martin D. Sass of M. D. Sass Investors Services said, \"Mr. Exley played his cards pretty strongly to get A.T.& T. up to $110.\" **********In the end, the booming stock market made a hero out of Mr. Exley. **********A.T.& T.'s stock was trading around $30 in December. At the time, A.T.& T. said it was willing to pay for NCR with stock or cash. A stock offer at that time would have involved three A.T.& T. shares for each NCR share. **********But in April, with the shares of A.T.& T. above $37, A.T.& T. could agree to meet NCR's asking price of $110, at minimal additional cost. **********A.T.& T. plans to issue new stock to acquire NCR. Analysts estimated that the new stock would dilute A.T.& T.'s per-share earnings by 10 to 15 cents a year. Staying in Dayton **********A.T.& T. said NCR would retain its headquarters in Dayton, and its corporate name. Mr. Allen, the A.T.& T. chairman, said NCR would continue to support civic and philanthropic organizations in Dayton. **********The companies have been on the verge of an agreement for three weeks. Part of the final haggling was over how much protection NCR shareholders would have if A.T.& T.'s stock price fell while the acquisition was being completed. **********In a compromise, A.T.& T. agreed to insure that NCR shareholders would receive $110 worth of stock as long as A.T.& T. shares traded between $34.125 and $40.625. **********The exact number of A.T.& T. shares to be exchanged for each NCR share will be determined by A.T.& T.'s average closing price during the 20 trading days before NCR shareholders meet to vote on the merger. A date for the meeting has not been set, but it is expected to take place in four to five months. **********The maximum number of A.T.& T. shares exchanged for each NCR share would be 3.223, if A.T.& T. stock fell to $34.125 or below. The minimum number would be 2.708, if A.T.& T. stock was $40.625 or above. **********Analysts said it was unlikely that A.T.& T. stock would fall below $34.125 without a significant overall market drop. Several analysts have predicted that A.T.& T.'s stock would rise to about $50 in the next 12 months. **********As an all-stock deal, the merger would be tax-free to NCR stockholders. Some Special Accouting **********The all-stock deal also makes it possible for A.T.& T. to use an accounting treatment known as a pooling of interests, which would be favorable to its reported earnings. **********A.T.& T. and NCR plan to talk to the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if the pooling method can be used. If not, A.T.& T. plans to offer 40 percent cash and 60 percent stock. **********Mr. Exley led the resistance to A.T.& T.'s offer, initially saying NCR was worth at least $125 a share. Before NCR's March 28 annual meeting, he said he would accept $110. **********Mr. Exley, who has more than 30 years of experience in the computer business, played an unusually active role in fending off A.T.& T., as he and his management team kept the company's Wall Street advisers on a tight leash. **********\"Let's just say that they are very actively involved in deciding their own approach to things,\" said a person working with NCR. **********During the takeover fight, NCR contended that A.T.& T. was taking advantage of a temporary drop in NCR's stock price. But beyond stalling for time, Mr. Exley had few options after A.T.& T. made its initial bid. **********And as time went on, his options were reduced. Ruling by a Judge **********In March, a Federal judge in Dayton threw out NCR's main line of defense, an employee stock ownership plan, saying that it had been adopted simply to protect the incumbent management and that it made a mockery of shareholder rights. At NCR's annual meeting in March, NCR shareholders voted Mr. Exley off the board, as A.T.& T. won four seats. **********The deal will add considerably to the wealth of Mr. Exley and other NCR executives. Through stock options and direct holdings, Mr. Exley owns more than 306,359 shares of NCR, worth nearly $34 million under terms of the deal. Gilbert P. Williamson, NCR's new chief executive, has stock options and holdings worth about $11 million at the purchase price. **********Mr. Exley plans to retire after the merger is complete. **********A.T.& T.'s unsuccessful ventures in computers began in 1983, with the company's investment in Ing. C. Olivetti & Company of Italy. Olivetti made a line of personal computers for A.T.& T. that proved to be unpopular, and A.T.& T. swapped its stake in the Italian company in 1989. **********Now the fate of A.T.& T.'s own computer business is uncertain. By publicly stating that it will turn its computer operation over to NCR's management, A.T.& T. has hurt morale among the 9,000 employees in its computer division. **********In preparation for the acquisition, the company has trimmed 1,000 jobs in the division since fall. **********Mr. Allen would not speculate on the fate of A.T.& T.'s computer employees yesterday. **********Several months ago, A.T.& T. said it would pay bonuses to workers who remained at their jobs for six months to discourage worried workers from looking for jobs outside the company. **********Mr. Grubman, the analyst, said many of A.T.& T.'s computer employees would be dismissed. \"I don't think that NCR needs more people,\" he said. He added that the deal made immediate financial sense for A.T.& T. because it would allow the company to replace its unprofitable computer operation with a profitable one. **********A.T.& T. said yesterday that the acquisition would result in \"one-time material charges to A.T.& T.'s earnings.\" **********fter more than five months of stubborn resistance, NCR agreed yesterday to be acquired by A.T.& T. for $7.4 billion worth of A.T.& T. stock. **********The acquisition signals the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's determination to expand beyond telecommunications to compete in computers with giants like NEC and Fujitsu of Japan, Siemens of Germany and I.B.M. **********In starting its quest to buy the NCR Corporation, A.T.& T. was seeking a permanent solution to the problem of its money-losing computer business and hoping to find a way to expand into new markets, ones that increasingly rely on linking computers and communications. Analysts say A.T.& T.'s computer business has lost more than $2 billion in six years. **********NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, grew from the National Cash Register Company (it still makes some cash registers) to become the fifth-largest computer maker in the country. **********When A.T.& T. began its pursuit of NCR in December, many industry observers were surprised that kindly Ma Bell had put on the grim visage of a corporate raider. The hostile bid was another milestone in the transformation of the heavily regulated bureaucratic monopoly that existed before the 1984 court-ordered breakup of the Bell System. **********In recent years, as a more aggressive corporation, A.T.& T. has cut costs and more closely tied executive pay to profit levels. **********Robert E. Allen, the chairman of A.T.& T., said yesterday that with NCR the company would work toward providing \"global computer networks as easy to use and accessible as the telephone network is today.\" **********Jack B. Grubman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said: \"A.T.& T. would like to be a $100 billion company by the end of the decade. They would love to be able to go to the chief executive officer of Nestle and say, 'We will provide you soup to nuts, your entire information network.' \" **********Given that assumption, Mr. Grubman and others say more large deals are likely to follow. \"Over the next decade they will do several more deals of this size or bigger,\" Mr. Grubman said. **********Under the definitive merger agreement, A.T.& T. will exchange $110 worth of its own stock for each NCR share, but on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, NCR's shares closed at just $104, up 50 cents. The difference reflects the fact that investors are expected to have to wait four months for the deal to close. But that price is still more than double the $48 that NCR was trading for a month before A.T T. made its first offer in December. A.T.& T.'s shares slipped 37.5 cents yesterday, to $36.75. **********A.T.& T. dwarfs NCR in size, with 1990 revenues of $37.3 billion, compared with $6.2 billion for NCR. Still, the computer maker will provide A.T.& T. important entries into financial and retail industries. NCR is in the process of introducing a line of \"open system\" computers that are capable of being linked with computers and software made by different manufacturers. **********The merger agreement signed yesterday is subject to the approval of NCR shareholders. The First Bid **********It all started in December, when A.T.& T. offered $90 a share, or $6.1 billion, for NCR. By keeping A.T.& T. at bay during the winter, Charles E. Exley Jr., NCR's chairman, was able to cajole A.T.& T. into paying an additional $1.3 billion. **********\"He has done a lot for shareholders,\" said Don Geogerian, head of research of Dreyfus Management Inc., an institutional stockholder of NCR. **********Martin D. Sass of M. D. Sass Investors Services said, \"Mr. Exley played his cards pretty strongly to get A.T.& T. up to $110.\" **********In the end, the booming stock market made a hero out of Mr. Exley. **********A.T.& T.'s stock was trading around $30 in December. At the time, A.T.& T. said it was willing to pay for NCR with stock or cash. A stock offer at that time would have involved three A.T.& T. shares for each NCR share. **********But in April, with the shares of A.T.& T. above $37, A.T.& T. could agree to meet NCR's asking price of $110, at minimal additional cost. **********A.T.& T. plans to issue new stock to acquire NCR. Analysts estimated that the new stock would dilute A.T.& T.'s per-share earnings by 10 to 15 cents a year. Staying in Dayton **********A.T.& T. said NCR would retain its headquarters in Dayton, and its corporate name. Mr. Allen, the A.T.& T. chairman, said NCR would continue to support civic and philanthropic organizations in Dayton. **********The companies have been on the verge of an agreement for three weeks. Part of the final haggling was over how much protection NCR shareholders would have if A.T.& T.'s stock price fell while the acquisition was being completed. **********In a compromise, A.T.& T. agreed to insure that NCR shareholders would receive $110 worth of stock as long as A.T.& T. shares traded between $34.125 and $40.625. **********The exact number of A.T.& T. shares to be exchanged for each NCR share will be determined by A.T.& T.'s average closing price during the 20 trading days before NCR shareholders meet to vote on the merger. A date for the meeting has not been set, but it is expected to take place in four to five months. **********The maximum number of A.T.& T. shares exchanged for each NCR share would be 3.223, if A.T.& T. stock fell to $34.125 or below. The minimum number would be 2.708, if A.T.& T. stock was $40.625 or above. **********Analysts said it was unlikely that A.T.& T. stock would fall below $34.125 without a significant overall market drop. Several analysts have predicted that A.T.& T.'s stock would rise to about $50 in the next 12 months. **********As an all-stock deal, the merger would be tax-free to NCR stockholders. Some Special Accouting **********The all-stock deal also makes it possible for A.T.& T. to use an accounting treatment known as a pooling of interests, which would be favorable to its reported earnings. **********A.T.& T. and NCR plan to talk to the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if the pooling method can be used.

Shiite Muslims, who form 55 percent of Iraq's population of 18 million, have risen in the south and Kurds have claimed their own revolt in the north. President Hussein's 12-year-old Government is rooted in the Sunni Muslim Arab minority. **********Reuters reported today that the Republican Guards were in the streets of the capital and had put up roadblocks on its approaches, suggesting an effort to tighten security to prevent rebellion from spilling into the capital. **********The replacement of Interior Minister Sameer Mohamed Abdul-Wahab with President Hussein's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, was announced on the Baghdad radio as allied officials in Saudi Arabia said Republican Guard forces had apparently turned the tide of a revolt in Shiite-dominated portions of southern Iraq. **********The Kurdish rebels, however, claimed today to have occupied towns in the Kurdish-speaking north. **********Majid belongs to a clan that has intermarried with President Hussein's family in the Tikrit region north of Baghdad. He was the second family member to be brought closer into the ruling elite since the occupation of Kuwait last Aug. 2. **********According to specialists, he has risen through the ranks of Iraq's intelligence and internal security services to become one of President Hussein's closest aides. His brother, Hussein Kamal al-Majid, was appointed Oil Minister after the invasion of Kuwait. **********While some of President Hussein's exiled adversaries interpreted the change of ministers as a sign of the Iraqi leader's increasing dependence on loyalists bound by family ties, other analysts saw it as a show of strength. Wants to Demonstrate Control **********\"He wants to demonstrate to his enemies that he and his clan are absolutely in command,\" said Charles Tripp, a London-based scholar with close knowledge of Iraqi politics. The man Ali Hassan al-Majid replaced, Mr. Abdul-Wahab, had also been viewed as close associate of President Hussein. **********Both the Shiites and the Kurds are backed by Iraq's neighbors, Iran and Syria, which have a long record of animosity toward Baghdad. In the war, Iran professed neutrality and Syria sided with the United States and its allies. An Iranian official, Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi, sought today to distance Teheran from the revolt in southern Iraq, saying that \"no country must interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq.\" **********However, Arab diplomats here said, Teheran seemed to have offered at least tacit support to the revolt by highlighting news of it through its official news organizations. **********President Hussein sought today to buttress the loyalty of his troops after their defeat by ordering monthly bonuses, particularly to the Republican Guards, which numbered 150,000 men at the beginning of the crisis but which allied commanders said were largely destroyed as a fighting force. Largest Bonus to Guard Units **********The bonuses, the Baghdad radio said, were 100 dinars -- 300 dollars at the official exchange rate -- for the Republican Guard, representing a one-third increase of salaries of 300 dinars. Army and police volunteers were given bonuses equivalent to $150, and regular soldiers were given increases of $50 a month. **********Despite Western assessments of the Republican Guards' disarray, Western officials in Saudi Arabia said loyalist troops had apparently put down an Islamic revolt in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, where rebellious Shiites claimed to have control over the weekend. **********While the Shiites form a minority of the world's Muslims, they represent a majority in Iran and southern Iraq. **********But the officials said the southern city of Karbala, which houses one of the most sacred Shiite shrines, was in turmoil, and further strife had been reported from Najaf, where a gold-domed mosque marks the tomb of Shiism's founder, the Imam Ali. A Republican Guard unit was reported heading for Karbala. [ Although the allies continue to contol a broad swath of southern Iraq, a State Department official in Washington said on Wednesday that outside powers should not intervene in Iraq's affairs during the period of instability. But President Bush and others have said several times that they would like to see President Hussein overthrown. ] **********As allied accounts described a gradual reassertion of Government control in the south, Kurdish dissidents said from their exiled headquarters in Paris and Damascus that their insurgents, known as the Pesh Merga -- \"those who face death\" -- were confronting loyalist forces and had taken control of five cities, including Erbil, the provincial capital. Significant Battle Reported **********Jalal Talabani, leader of the Marxist Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, told reporters in Damascus that \"tens of thousands of guerrillas\" were fighting 60,000 Government troops in the north. **********He said Erbil and the towns of Salahad-Din, Khabata, Daratow and Aski Kalak were under insurgent control. The claim has not been verified. **********Also today, Iraq's Government-controlled Baath newspaper carried an article it said was signed by Mr. Hussein's son, Udai, in which he denied reports that he had been killed in Basra. **********News that President Hussein had elevated Mr. Majid to the main internal security portfolio, however, produced fearful responses among many Kurds, who remember the days in March 1988 when attacks with what they describe as chemical weapons killed an estimated 5,000 Iraqi Kurds at the town of Halabja on the Iran-Iraq border. **********In August 1988 Iraq agreed to a cease-fire with Iran after an eight-year war. The Republican Guard then turned against the Kurds, who had sympathized with the Iranians. **********Kurds are a fractured group, mainly Sunni Muslims, whose disparate clans total an estimated 20 million people spread over Iraq, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Syria and Iran. They have fought for many years for Kurdish states, without success. Iraq has offered its Kurdish minority a form of autonomy, but has never succeeded in eradicating revolt. **********Mr. Majid, said one Kurdish exile in Paris, \"will try to destroy the people. He is known by everyone in Kurdistan and Iraq as a terrorist and very dangerous.\" **********Mr. Tripp, the London-based expert on Iraqi politics, said that in the mid-1980's Mr. Majid assumed responsibility for coordinating the country's five intelligence services and became a member of the Special Bureau, an inner caucus of loyalists, many of them linked to the Iraqi leader by blood ties. **********Before the August 1988 cease-fire with Iran, he was assigned as commander of northern Iraq -- meaning the Kurdish areas -- and given the job of obliterating Kurdish dissent. Tens of Thousands Fled **********Tens of thousands of Kurds fled into Turkey and Iran as the campaign unfolded. Western specialists with close knowledge of Iraqi affairs said that while Iraq's military had balked at a scorched earth policy against the Kurds, the 48-year-old Mr. Majid did not. Under his control, Iraqi authorities enforced population transfers, evacuating Kurdish villages in border areas and moving their residents to southern Iraq. **********During the first few months of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, when exiled Kuwaitis reported many atrocities, he was effectively the military governor of Kuwait. **********Since the end of the gulf war less than a week ago, President Hussein has acquiesced with uncharacteristic speed in allied demands for a cease-fire, reversing his annexation of Kuwait, offering to return Kuwaiti assets and releasing allied prisoners. **********His intention, analysts and diplomatas believe, is to remove any source of friction with the Western allies and pursue his crackdown on internal dissent. He has reportedly calculated that a fractured Iraq, or a Shiite fundamentalist regime in Baghdad, would offer the United States and its allies more problems that his own continued tenure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/business/worldbusiness/IHT-and-european-currencies-eurobonds.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1991-08-26", "snippet": "Bankers are expecting a heavy flow of new Eurobond issues in coming weeks as issuers and investors return from their summer holidays.

The fear ignited by Monday's coup in the Soviet Union did send the dollar up sharply - but the fact that the rush into the perceived safe haven of the dollar failed to drive the currency to a new high for the year cast a long shadow over forecasts that the dollar would be trading at 2 Deutsche marks by year-end. **********Anticipation of continued big currency gains has been a major element in whetting international demand for dollar-denominated bonds. At the current rate of 1.75 DM, the dollar is up 21 percent from its record low set in February. But there are increasing doubts whether in the near term it will be able to climb much over 1.80 DM. **********Meanwhile, with the economies of Japan and Germany expected to start slowing sharply in coming months, interest rates in Japan and Europe are expected to begin falling and push up bond prices. **********Japan Development Bank met a tremendous response last week when it sold 120 billion yen of 10-year government-guaranteed bonds priced to yield 4 basis points more than comparably dated domestic government bonds. By the end of the week, the paper was trading 4 basis points below domestic government yields. **********For international investors the development bank's bonds were more attractive than domestic paper, which is subject to a withholding tax on interest payments as well as a transaction tax. Managers said less than 5 percent of the issue was sold to Japanese investors and estimated that two-thirds was taken by institutional investors in Europe. **********The large size of the issue was also welcome because it assures an active and liquid secondary market - a feature that remains uncommon in the Euroyen sector. **********IN CONTRAST to the institutional investors' strategy of pursuing capital gains from expected interest rate cuts, retail clients were in evidence last week stretching for high yield. Double-digit returns were offered by Latin American issuers who tapped the Eurodollar sector. A substantial portion of this paper, bankers report, is being sold to Latin Americans - effectively repatriating offshore flight capital. **********In addition, there is demand from the growing number of emerging markets funds as well as from U.S. insurance and pension funds that remain hungry for the high yields on junk bonds. About half of the $200 million issue from Petrobras, Brazil's oil company, was distributed as a private placement to U.S. investors. **********While the credit ratings for Brazil and Venezuela remain below investment grade, the fact remains that in the nine years since the debt crisis erupted no issuer has defaulted on servicing bonds while bank debt has been continuously rescheduled and in part forgiven. **********Although a growing portion of Latin debt is now in the form of bonds as a result of the officially sponsored debt-reduction plan suggested by Nicholas Brady, the U.S. Treasury secretary, the short-term nature of the Eurobond offers comfort to investors. **********The Petrobras paper was issued for five years with an annual yield of 12.25 percent paid semiannually. The company has the right to call the paper after two years - in which case holders will earn a semiannual yield of 12.75 percent - and holders have the right to request early repayment after three years, earning 12.375 percent. **********Brazil has yet to agree on a Brady Plan restructuring of its bank debt, and the bonds were priced to yield 5 percentage points more than comparably dated U.S. government bonds. **********Venezuela, which has restructured its debt and ranks about equal with Mexico as the most creditworthy of the big Latin American debtors, offered $150 million of five-year bonds with no opportunity for early repayment to yield 9.59 percent - a spread of 2.35 percentage points over U.S. government paper. **********The terms were considered comparatively stingy. Last March, Mexico paid a spread of 2.4 percentage points for three-year money. But in all cases, these issues are largely placed before they are announced so there is not much loose paper waiting to be sold. **********Venezuela's major private cement company, Vencemos, also tapped the market, seeking $35 million for two years and $40 million for five years with the yields. The two-year paper offered a 3.2 percentage point spread over comparable U.S. Treasuries, while the five-year securities were priced at a 3.9 point spread. **********Argentina, which also lags in solving its overhang of bank debt, is expected to come to market this week for up to $200 million and one of the nation's largest private companies will be seeking $100 million. **********When not seeking high yields, European retail investors were out in force to buy $250 million of four-year notes issued by Deutsche Bank and $200 million of five-year paper offered by Swiss Bank Corp. Both issues were priced to yield a scant 30 basis points over U.S. Treasury paper - the level at which the World Bank giant global bonds trade."},

of the agreement to restrict Japanese car imports during a seven-year transition period beginning in 1993. **********\"Articles have questioned what the agreement says because some people don't like what it does say,\" he said Tuesday in an interview. \"It's as simple as that. **********He added \"So if you don't like it, you can't go home and say that you can try to fur it up at the edges, and

of the EC-Japanese pact almost as soon as it was agreed to on July 31. **********The chairman of the French state-owned automaker Renault, Raymond Levy, has also been critical of the agreement, warning of huge job losses in the EC auto industry. **********\"We're tired of people trying to unstitch the agreement,\" said one official. \"People have been saying after this pact has been negotiated that it is now open to negotiations, and that's just not true.\" **********In a sense, the emotional European Community debate over Japanese cars has now come full-circle: months of bitter debate among EC countries over how many vehicles to allow was followed by a period of hard bargaining with Japan, and now the intra-Community sniping has resumed. **********The EC-Japan agreement restricts direct imports from Japan to 1.23 million per year by 1999, and a totally free market takes effect in 2000. **********There is an EC assumption, however, that transplant production within the Community, which totaled 260,000 last year, will not exceed 1.2 million by 1999. **********\"That assumption is made, nobody is in disagreement over it, but it is not a control,\" said Sir Leon. \"It is absolutely clear that cars made in Europe by Japanese-owned companies are in the same position as cars made in Europe by U.S.-owned companies, that is, that you are free to make as many as you like.\" **********Top Commission officials are concerned that continuing confusion over the agreement will only be counterproductive, by distracting Community automakers from the difficult task of adapting the industry to make it competitive in a true open market after the turn of the century."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/business/worldbusiness/IHT-ecjapan-talks-no-gain-no-pain.html":

Community was eager to promote broader ties with Tokyo to help establish its own political identity. **********Although the Community and Japan remained far apart on a range of trade and investment disputes, Brussels appeared willing to put these concerns to one side. **********\"Serious trade problems remain which should not be underestimated,\" said Frans Andriessen, the EC Commission's vice president for external affairs in a speech Tuesday in Osaka. \"The need to strengthen relations between both parties derives in the first place from political considerations.\" **********Mr. Andriessen's visit marked the first ministerial-level meeting since the landmark declaration last July in The Hague that committed both sides to \"equitable\" market access and coordination on international security issues, from arms control to drug trafficking. **********Both sides find themselves in similar stages of political development. \"Tokyo and Brussels represent major economic players whose political capacity is lacking maturity,\" Mr. Andriessen noted. **********But more than political ties, however, the issue that dominated Mr. Andriessen's talks with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and members of Japan's newly installed cabinet was trade. Japan conceded nothing, an outcome Brussels appeared resigned to accept. **********An EC official said: \"The U.S. has sticks. The EC doesn't.\" He was referring to the Community's commitment to seek multilateral resolutions to trade disputes, unlike Washington, which in the past used the threat of its trade law to retaliate unilaterally. **********On the political front, there was plenty of hope but no concrete results. Officials were pleased that Brussels and Tokyo had begun to seek cooperation on regional issues. **********\"With the U.S., we've had a dialogue, and plenty of squabbles,\" said Kaoru Ishikawa, a Foreign Ministry official in charge of EC affairs. \"This hadn't existed before with Europe as a whole.\" **********Tokyo expressed an interest - but made no commitment - in giving more assistance to Eastern and Central Europe, although it shot down a request to give more aid to the Soviet Union. **********\"We're more and more interested in Eastern Europe,\" Mr. Ishikawa said. \"But it remains very far away, both psychologically and geographically.\" **********Brussels, for its part, shares a common interest in the Cambodian peace process. But it balked at a Japanese request to cofinance a reforestation project in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. **********While continuing to seek areas of political cooperation, the Community also stressed that improved trade was the most efficient means of achieving political aims. **********Brussels also sought to fight what it saw as Tokyo's tendency to cave in to U.S. pressure to buy American-made goods. **********That is one reason why, in talks with Trade Minister Kozo Watanabe, EC officials focused on aircraft, telecommunications and other high-technology items it feels are competitive, yet have little market penetration in Japan. **********Another is that stepped-up purchases of these big-ticket items would go a long way toward trimming the Community's trade deficit with Japan, which is set to soar to a record $30 billion in 1991, after $18.5 billion a year ago, according to EC estimates. **********But to Japanese officials, Mr. Andriessen's appeals on trade sounded disingenuous. The chief cause of the imbalance, they said, was rising consumer demand in Germany following unification and a slowdown in Japanese demand for European paintings and luxury goods. The onus was on European companies to work harder to penetrate the Japanese market, they added. **********Mr. Ishikawa said: \"Unless we try to vacuum in what they're trying to sell there won't be a balance in trade. It's a pity.\" **********Yet in a compromise that resembles the two-way criticism of Tokyo's Structural Impediments Initiative talks with Washington, the Community and Japan have agreed to exchange lists of specific demands on bilateral trade and investment concerns by next spring's round of senior-level meetings. **********Brussels, however, apparently backed down from an earlier threat to impose a deadline for Tokyo to respond to its specific requests. **********Mr. Watanabe also assured Mr. Andriessen that Japanese automakers' recently announced plans to expand procurement of foreign auto parts would not focus exclusively on the United States. **********Mr. Andriessen also pushed Japan to open its rice market and accept a proposal to convert nontariff barriers into tariffs to help reach a major agreement on freer trade in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. **********Although Japanese officials failed to accept his demand, they appeared to be slowly preparing the groundwork to make an 11th-hour concession that would open the market from 3 percent to 5 percent but continue to protect Japanese farmers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/business/worldbusiness/IHT-receivership-likely-for-maxwell-firms.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Ipsen", "pub_date": "1991-12-05", "snippet": "It now appears unlikely that the companies controlled by the Maxwell family will avoid receivership. .

The new rules will apply to those posted abroad after Jan. 1, but will not apply to expatriates now in place until June 30, 1993. **********\"It represents a substantial pay cut,\" said Ken Martin, vice president of the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, the union for Dow Jones employees in the United States. Employees abroad are not covered by the union contract, but Mr. Martin said the union was receiving calls from expatriates. **********Donald L. Miller, vice president of employee relations for Dow Jones, said the \"very substantial subsidy\" now in place for housing would be replaced by a formula that gives subsidies only to the extent that housing costs in a foreign city exceed those in the New York City area. **********Those working abroad for Dow Jones will be expected to take care of their own housing, just as they would if they were working in New York. **********The company is also changing the way it calculates the net pay in dollars of employees abroad. The company guarantees that expatriates will be paid enough to maintain this net pay, regardless of currency fluctuations. But the lower the net pay, the lower the basis for compensation. **********Currently, only Federal taxes are deducted from gross pay in calculating net pay. Under the new system, New York state and city nonresident taxes will also be deducted. The added taxes represent 8 to 9 percent of gross wages. **********Other benefits, like home leave and relocation reimbursement, will remain unchanged. **********No details were given on how much the average expatriate's compensation would be reduced. **********Mr. Miller declined to predict how much money the company would save. A letter to expatriates said the company was now spending $4 million on overseas allowances, which account for more than half of their total compensation. **********He said the change reflected Dow Jones's evolution from an American company with a few expatriate workers to a global company. **********About 1,800 employees work abroad for various editions of The Journal, the Telerate financial-data subsidiary and other Dow Jones operations. Of these, only 120 are expatriates; the rest are foreign nationals who do not receive a housing allowance. **********Anders F. Halden, regional manager in New York for the Corporate Resources Group, a Geneva-based concern that helped set up the new Dow Jones compensation system, said he was unaware of any other news organizations that were setting up similar systems. **********\"We hope to be able to catch more, using Dow Jones as a reference point\" Mr. Halden said. **********Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The New York Times Company, said the company gave its expatriate employees a cost-of-living allowance, which included a subsidy for housing and currency fluctuations. She said the Times Company re-evaluated the method for setting that allowance annually, but that there were no current plans to change that method. Rumors in Little Rock **********Little Rock, Ark., was aflame with rumors last week that the struggling Arkansas Gazette was about to be sold by the Gannett Company to its archrival, The Arkansas Democrat. **********Some local television stations quoted unidentified sources as saying that a sale was probably imminent. **********But neither Gannett nor Walter E. Hussman Jr., owner of The Democrat, has been willing to explain what is going on. Thus far, there is voluminous smoke, but no apparent fire. **********Douglas H. McCorkindale, Gannett's vice chairman, said, \"Nothing is going to happen soon.\" But he added that Gannett was \"in a total no-comment posture on Little Rock.\" **********A secretary for Mr. Hussman said he was unavailable for comment. **********The sale scenario makes sense in that Gannett is widely believed to be losing heavily in Little Rock. Two persons close to the company's affairs said The Gazette was expected to lose more than $30 million this year. **********Gannett acquired The Gazette in 1986 for $51 million and the assumption of $9 million of existing debt. **********The Democrat is also unprofitable. But Mr. Hussman's Wehco Media group has other profitable ventures that offset the losses, and the paper has gained in circulation and advertising market share since 1986. **********Gannett is widely believed to be trying to either sell The Gazette, close it or persuade Mr. Hussman to agree to a joint operating arrangement in which production, distribution and advertising would be merged, while both papers would continue. **********But Mr. Hussman has said he does not want to be in a joint operating arrangement with Gannett. **********Lee Dirks, president of Lee Dirks & Associates, a newspaper brokerage in Birmingham, Mich., said the Justice Department would probably not allow Gannett to sell The Gazette to a direct rival like Mr. Hussman unless there were no other buyers. As owner of The Gazette, Mr. Hussman would be free to close it. **********Mr. Dirks added that should such a sale be in the works, Gannett would probably have to declare the paper was for sale and seek an alternate buyer. That might explain why nothing will happen soon. Twists in an Ad Format **********For four years, newspaper publishers have been talking about adopting a standard invoice format for national advertisers, in hopes that more national advertising will follow. **********Finally, it looks like they may actually get it done. **********A dizzying array of invoices made buying newspaper advertising difficult. So in 1988, a standard invoice format was introduced. **********While most papers claimed to have adopted it, \"each paper put a little twist to the format,\" said Uldis Grava, director of marketing planning for the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. He estimated that only 15 percent of the nation's newspapers actually used the format correctly. **********The current advertising drought has spurred action. In mid-September, the bureau's board will meet to complete a new simplified format. **********This time, chairmen of many of the largest newspaper groups have personally guaranteed strict compliance. Mr. Grava said the new standardized invoice should be widely adopted by the end of the year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/business/forum-scrap-consensus-try-diversity.html": {"writer_name": "Allan Cox", "pub_date": "1991-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 488, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Scrap Consensus, Try Diversity", "print_headline": "FORUM; Scrap Consensus, Try Diversity", "body_text": " **********One of the great bogus concepts wafting through management suites is something called \"consensus:\" solving knotty problems through unanimity. **********As a concept it's a failure -- and in the end, that's what it produces, too: failure and mediocrity in performance, accountability, options, even commitment to the project. Something that is everyone's task is nobody's task. **********But another management strategy is fast becoming the mark of corporations that excel -- Motorola, Corning, Intel, 3M, among others -- and it involves teamwork without consensus. This strategy spins on the ability of a company to manage diversity. **********This is how it works. Consider a team to be a well-identified unit of five to nine peers who share time and space and report to a boss or team leader. Imagine assembling a team of people who are well educated, talented and well trained. They care about their business and each other. They've done their homework and in meetings, they act as advocates of particular ideas. **********It would be downright silly to think these people might arrive at a single point of view. More to the point, we shouldn't want them to. Who needs resolutions so watered down that no one cares what gets decided? What companies should strive for is a climate that encourages competing options. That's what produces results. **********How can companies achieve this? To manage diversity, someone must sit at the head of the table to make the final decision, to choose from competing options that have been brought up by team members. Those \"facilitators,\" the hottest executives in America today, are: *********** Astute selectors, carefully determining who will be on their team. They may be new to the job, and even inherit a team, but they must be able to assess who's with them and who's not, who should be hired and fired, and who can be given more time to grow because potential is there. *********** Invisible initiators, encouraging team members to act on their diverse strengths. They believe in their people more than those associates believe in themselves. They make sure employees stretch themselves and take risks. And they make sure the employees -- not the facilitators -- get credit for accomplishments. *********** Willing workers, who don't sit behind a desk, barking orders. Nor do they overdelegate. Rather, they give their strengths to the organization, doing their share of the work that is generated through collaborations with team members. *********** Learners, prepared to have their minds changed by subordinates who may know more about the subject. This, of all their roles, is most important for facilitators. **********When all of these pieces are in place, they produce not only strong management but future strength: Subordinates learn from facilitators so that they, too, can manage diversity.

It was taken immediately to a forensic institute in Las Palmas, on Grand Canary Island, for an autopsy to ascertain the cause of death. **********Details of the bizarre death continued to unfold through the evening, with reports surfacing that Mr. Maxwell's mansion outside Oxford was under guard tonight.

Built Publishing Empire **********Mr. Maxwell fled the collapse of Czechoslovakia in 1939 to become one of the most powerful publishers in Britain and the world, presiding over a multibillion-dollar empire that he assembled with brass and bravura over 40 years.  [ Obituary, page D23. ] **********Mr. Maxwell's abrupt and unexpected end raised questions about what will happen to his business holdings, including The Daily News, which he purchased earlier this year as it teetered near collapse after a long strike. **********Analysts of the newspaper industry said that the death had cast the fate of the New York newspaper into serious doubt, with one expert noting that the Maxwell committment to the paper was \"more personal than corporate; more an ego trip than an investment.\" His tangled empire also includes Macmillan Inc., the publishing company, The Daily Mirror in London, and The European, a weekly newspaper designed to cover and circulate in an integrating Europe.  Sons to Head Empire **********Ian and Kevin Maxwell, two of Mr. Maxwell's sons, were named acting chairmen today of, respectively, the Mirror Newspaper Group and Maxwell Communications Corporation. **********The mysterious circumstances of Mr. Maxwell's death write a dramatic final scene for a man who himself seemed larger than life. Once a penniless refugee from Nazi persecution, he came to command a global business empire, and count among his acquaintances many world leaders. **********Politicians and colleagues in Britain rushed to pay him tribute today, describing him as \"the Citizen Kane of his time,\" reflecting the penchant for controversy that had characterized his life until the last.  Charge of Israeli Link **********Two weeks ago, he was described in a book as being closely linked with the Mossad, the Israeli secret service, an allegation that sparked an intense flurry of controversey here when it was aired in Parliament. **********Mr. Maxwell described the allegation as \"ludicrous, a total invention,\" and filed a libel action against the author, Seymour Hersh, a former reporter for The New York Times who is working on a special project for The Times's Washington bureau. **********The book, \"The Samson Option,\" which describes the development of Israel's nuclear weapons program, also accused Nicholas Davies, the foreign editor of The Daily Mirror, Mr. Maxwell's flagship paper, of working closely with a Mossad agent, and dealing in arms. **********Mr. Davies denied the charges and filed a libel suit of his own, but was later dismissed by Mr. Maxwell after questions were raised about a trip he allegedly made to Ohio to visit an arms merchant. **********There has also been mounting speculation about the condition of Mr. Maxwell's financial empire. **********A spokesman in London for the Mirror Newspaper Group said Mr.Maxwell had been on a solitary sailing holiday off the coast of North Africa since last Thursday, and was due to return to London late today or Wednesday. **********He was reported to be the only passenger aboard the gleaming yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, a 430-ton luxury vessel which is named after one of Mr. Maxwell's daughters. The yacht cost an estimated $25 million when it was commissioned in 1986 by a brother of Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian arms dealer. **********The news that Mr. Maxwell was missing first broke in London in mid-afternoon, when his two publically owned companies, Mirror Newspaper Group and Maxwell Communications Corporation, announced they were voluntarily suspending trading on the London stock exchange.  Announcement in Britain **********Shortly afterwards, the Mirror Group released a brief, eight-sentence statement, saying that Mr. Maxwell \"is missing at sea, feared lost overboard.\" **********The statement reported that a search was under way, and that weather conditions were good. The company also said that Mr. Maxwell's wife, Betty, and his eldest son, Philip, had left for Tenerife. **********According to a chronology pieced together from various company and official statements, Mr. Maxwell had boarded the yacht alone in Gibraltar last Thursday, after flying to the British colony from London. **********The yacht sailed to Madeira, off the coast of Morocco, and then on to the Canaries over the weekend. On Monday, Mr. Maxwell had telephone conversations from aboard the yacht with an executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, a lawyer in Paris and members of his family.  'Perfectly Good Mood' **********A company offical later described Mr. Maxwell as being in a \"perfectly good mood.\" **********Later, crew members reported seeing Mr. Maxwell walking on the deck of the yacht at about 4:25 A.M. Charles Wilson, executive editor of Mirror Group newspapers, said in an interview that it was not unusual for Mr. Maxwell to keep such late hours. **********\"He was a light sleeper, often up and about throughout the night,\" he said. **********Then about 20 minutes later, the crew reported he called the bridge from his stateroom, asking that the air conditioning in his quarters be turned down. **********That was the last time the crew reported any contact with Mr. Maxwell. About six hours later, at 11 A.M., the crew attempted to put a telephone call from New York through to Mr. Maxwell's stateroom, and there was no answer.

James Dean and Marlon Brando made motorcycles sexy and sinister. Malcolm Forbes associated them with well-heeled capitalists. Ronald Reagan visited a Harley-Davidson plant and presto, motorcycles symbolized America's renewed manufacturing competitiveness. **********But behind the scenes, the motorcycle business is a lot less glitzy than the parade of flashy names might indicate. In fact, it is downright depressed. The recession, creeping couch potatoism and an explosion of consumer electronics products vying for the dwindling discretionary dollar have created a shrinking market for motorcycles. **********According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, a trade group in Irvine, Calif., there are 7.3 million bikes on the road, down from 7.7 million in 1985. Don J. Brown, a motorcycle industry consultant also in Irvine, said sales of new street, dirt and sport bikes will reach $1.33 billion for 266,000 units this year, almost identical to last year, but a drop from the $1.9 billion in revenues and 680,000 bikes in the industry's peak year of 1984. **********Dealers report that their only vibrant sellers are accessories -- like mugs with motorcycle logos, helmets and helmet decals. **********Honda and the other Japanese companies have had the worst time of it, because the yen has made their products prohibitively expensive. But even America's Harley, which says it sells every bike it makes, is not sanguine. \"A shrinking market is difficult for everyone,\" said Michael E. Keefe, Harley's director of marketing communications. **********The council describes the typical rider as a 32.5-year-old man with household income of $39,200; a decade ago, he was about 27 and had household earnings of $17,800. \"Far from being a rebel, the typical cyclist is the guy next-door,\" said Gary A. Christopher, the American Honda Motor Company's manager of motorcycle product evaluation. **********The manufacturers are actively wooing that guy. Through the council, they have formed Discover Today's Motorcycling, a publicity campaign that positions motorcycling as safe, fun and something an educated, well-mannered person would do. American Honda's own $75 million campaign, \"Come Ride With Us,\" has the same goal. Competing With Japan Harley's Problem Is Too Few Bikes **********For a while, it looked as though Harley-Davidson would get an easy ride. **********Through much of the 1980's Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha and Suzuki, the four Japanese manufacturers that dominated the American motorcycle market, focused primarily on high-performance sport bikes -- bikes that could go 175 miles an hour, that let their riders crouch forward in racer stance as they took corners at hairpin angles. **********The problem, motorcycle experts say now, is that the Japanese were so busy innovating they forgot to hark to their market. \"Every year would bring a different looking, faster bike,\" said Paul Dean, editorial director of Cycle World Magazine in Newport Beach, Calif. \"That meant a steep depreciation rate, incredibly high costs for replacement parts and huge insurance premiums.\" **********By the late 1980's the Japanese were erring at the other extreme. Recognizing that they were cannibalizing each other's sales as the market shrunk, they set out to woo new riders. They advertised in magazines like Life instead of biker books, they spurned new high-tech products in favor of non-racy bikes like Honda's Pacific Coast, a midsize touring bike that even has a luggage trunk. **********\"We were trying so hard to get the yuppies that our core group of cycle enthusiasts felt abandoned,\" said Honda's Mr. Christopher. **********Against that backdrop, Harley cleaned up. It made big, clunky cruisers with lots of macho image but little glitz, whose basic design hadn't changed in years. A weak dollar helped it compete on price. **********Mr. Brown said Harley had nearly 31 percent of the street-bike market in 1991; second-seller Honda had 26 percent. R. L. Polk & Company, a Detroit company known for its auto industry statistics, said that in 1985, Honda had nearly 47 percent of the street-bike market, with Harley at a paltry 9.4 percent. **********But Harley's sales have been constrained by capacity. The company has a new paint facility and two new assembly lines about to open, but for now it cannot make more than about 70,000 bikes a year. And it exports about 40 percent of them. **********The result is that Harley dealers remain on allocation. \"I have six customers for every motorcycle I get,\" said Michael J. Lombardi, a Harley dealer in Staten Island. **********The Japanese, meanwhile, are back in stride. They are offering new sport bikes to win back enthusiasts, and small off-road bikes that offer an unintimidating introduction to biking. **********While they are unlikely to woo away the Schwarzenegger wannabes -- he rides a Harley -- industry experts think they have a good shot at riders who want a bike that is smaller than a Harley.  As Machines Age Used Bikes Are Selling -- For Now **********Bikers aren't the only ones getting older. So are their machines. **********According to the motorcycle council, the average motorcycle in 1985 was less than five years old; last year it was about 9.5. Dealers got more than 14 percent of their revenues from selling used bikes last year. **********In Harley's case, one reason why the used market is thriving is that demand for new bikes outstrips supply. For the Japanese bikes, which are more plentiful, the reasons are rooted in the steeply rising prices. \"People are saying, 'Let someone else take the depreciation,' and looking for good used bikes,\" said Mr. Dean of Cycle World.. **********The vibrant secondary market is unlikely to last much longer, though. As fewer new bikes are sold, the number of bikes coming into the used market must perforce dwindle. That means that the most popular used bikes will become harder to find, and concomittantly more expensive. **********Mr. Brown, the consultant, predicts that sales of used motorcycle will drop as much as 25 percent in the next four years. \"That means new bikes will soon sell well again,\" he said. The Requisite Helmet Sales Are Insured As States Pass Laws **********Bike manufacturers may be wimpering, but helmet makers are all smiles. The reason: Unlike bike sales, helmet sales have seen nary a blip. Though the council does not break out sales of helmets, sales of peripheral equipment reached $1.66 billion last year.

California, a major holdout, just passed such a law, effective Jan. 1. Most experts say a Federal law is inevitable. **********New helmet technology also is spurring sales.

His argument: Helmets took away too much hearing and peripheral vision. Now, he claims that motorcycle industry representatives took advantage of his post-accident emotional vulnerability to get him to castigate helmet laws. With almost religious zeal, he is holding press conferences, lobbying in Washington, and otherwise trying to insure that helmets are made mandatory throughout the country. **********\"There's a reason God let me come back alive,\" Mr. Busey said. \"And that's to make sure that we don't see more kids with the life smashed out of their bodies because they aren't wearing helmets.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/16/business/company-news-dividend-linked-to-pet-inc-spinoff.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Linked To Pet Inc.

Resorts, which underwent a bankruptcy reorganization in United States District Court in New Jersey, is expected to contribute an additional $5 million to the settlement. The $5 million had originally been given over to a litigation trustee appointed by the court to pay the legal expenses of bondholders who had claims against Mr. Trump. **********The settlement negotiation now hinges on whether Resorts will contribute any additional cash to the $17 million that bondholders are expected to get.

The bondholders represented in the negotiations have not yet filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump but have threatened to do so if a settlement of the claims they presented during the Resorts bankruptcy reorganization is not reached soon.   Deal With Griffin **********Mr. Griffin bought Resorts from Mr. Trump in a leveraged buyout in 1988. Mr. Trump kept the company's then-unfinished Taj Mahal casino for $273 million and also received, through a lucrative management contract, about $64 million from Resorts. **********The bondholders who will receive this settlement held about $300 million of Resorts bonds that were issued before Mr. Trump took control of the company.

That account was created to pay the bondholders, who also got certain trust certificates during the Resorts reorganization, if they could not settle their claims against Mr. Trump by Sept. 1, 1991. If the claims are settled before that date, the $3.8 million must be returned to Resorts. Mr. Feinberg has asked Resorts to contribute about half of the $3.8 million to the settlement money because if no settlement is reached by September, Resorts will lose the entire sum. **********If Resorts agrees to the demand, the bondholders could eventually receive about $19.5 million in cash. **********Corporate Officers and Directors Assurance Holding Ltd., a Bermuda insurer that provided liability insurance to the officers and directors of the Taj Mahal, will put up the bulk of the $12 million in cash that Mr. Trump's interests will contribute.

The six-story structures, which are connected by a central garden, contain 272 apartments ranging in size from studios to three bedrooms. The complex was converted into a co-op in 1981. **********Twenty of the seized units have already been sold, but by hiring a professional auctioneer and marketing the remaining 109 units the way a developer might, the co-op board hopes to sell them all at a Nov. 24 auction. The sale will be at the St. Moritz Hotel at 50 Central Park South at 1 P.M. **********Potential buyers can view the eight vacant units, all of which are one-bedroom apartments. Floor plans of the 101 occupied apartments, which must be purchased subject to the tenancy of rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants, can be examined at a sales office at the co-op that has been furnished as a model apartment. The auction company, Carlton Property Auctions Inc. of Great Neck, L.I., is holding seminars at the model on Thursday evenings and weekends to acquaint buyers with how the auction will work. **********The apartments will be auctioned in pools, with each pool containing about 25 units. Each winning bidder selects the apartment of his or her choice left in that pool. All apartments except three vacant units will be sold to the highest bidder. Those three units, vacated by tenants under an offer that they move out in return for a 50 percent share of the proceeds, have minimum bids of $45,000, $65,000 and $90,000. **********Jayby Associates of Manhattan, which did the conversion, sold many of the occupied units to investor groups. Although maintenance payments on those units began to fall into arrears as long ago as 1988, most of the proprietary leases of the investors were not canceled until last spring. **********Gracie Gardens is one among many co-ops affected by sponsor defaults that are struggling to find ways of disposing of siezed apartments that often cost much more in monthly maintenance charges than they return in rental income. The 101 rental units at Gracie Gardens, for example, pay a total of $50,230 in rent, but the maintenance charges on the units add up to $110,829, a difference of $60,599 each month. **********The number of such defaults has grown steadily over the last two years, with an estimated 500 buildings affected, according to the State Attorney General's office. **********\"What is so interesting about Gracie Gardens is that literally at the Mayor's doorstep is a case study of the kind of things that can go wrong with co-ops,\" said Leonard Lombard, a Manhattan broker and owner of Penthouse Properties who has handled many apartment resales in the complex. \"Here in a microcosm, you have a sponsor who can't make his payments, shareholders that literally have been bled to death, repairs required by city law that perhaps are too expensive, and a co-op that perhaps wanted to be more than it should be.\" **********Maintenance costs at Gracie Gardens have almost tripled since 1981, up from $12.38 to $32.54 a share annually. A one-bedroom unit paying $4,209.20 a year maintenance 10 years ago now pays $11,064. **********\"Maintenance costs may be high compared to other buildings, but that comparison is very deceptive,\" said Lawrence M. Kaye, president of the co-op board. \"We have done our capital improvements and we have a fairly good mortgage situation, so unless you know the status of other buildings, to compare is not fair.\" Improvements, financed by a mortgage, have included new roofs, new windows, asbestos removal, and refurbished boilers and lobbies. **********Insider prices in 1981 ranged from $39,000 to $116,000. In a pre-auction campaign that ended Oct. 28, occupied rental units were offered to tenants and to co-op shareholders for $13,000 to $19,000, resulting in 18 sales and two pending contracts, said Steven W. Birbach, president of Carlton Property Auctions. Prices that may go even lower at the Nov. 24 auction will provide opportunities for investors willing to wait for a tenant to move, he said. In a recent resale, a two-bedroom unit at 510 East 90th Street sold for only $155,000, but three years ago, a one-bedroom at 520 East 90th Street fetched $225,000. **********Auction incentives include a 25 percent monthly rebate on maintenance costs that is being offered to buyers of occupied units for the first two years.

But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery. **********The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products. A Matter of Perceptions **********Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor. **********The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year. **********\"Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad,\" said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. \"It is our lifeblood.\" Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop. **********American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development. **********But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion. **********While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994.  Taking on More Debt **********As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion; a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995. **********After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects \"are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments\" to cut costs and looking for ways \"to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend.\" **********Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward. **********Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive. **********\"The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone,\" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. \"But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks.\" He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario. **********Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as \"Festus,\" the grizzled codger in the \"Gunsmoke\" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993.  No Profits, No Cash **********In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending. **********One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985. **********The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check. **********In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  The Cost of Competition **********Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash. **********Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein. **********Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. \"The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/30/business/luxury-tax-is-criticized.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1991-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Luxury Tax Is Criticized", "print_headline": "Luxury Tax Is Criticized", "body_text": " **********The excise tax on luxury items passed by Congress last year has hurt the middle class by depressing sales in the automobile, jewelry, boat and aircraft industries, business executives told Republican lawmakers today. **********Automobile dealers told the House Republican Study Committee that the 10 percent luxury tax on cars costing more than $30,000 had kept customers away and forced the dealers to lay off sales people and other workers. **********\"Clearly, the luxury tax has failed miserably in achieving its apparently intended goal of soaking the rich,\" said Joseph Herson, who owns a Porsche, Jaguar and Audi dealership in Rockville, Md. \"All it has done is hurt small businesses and working men and women and their families across the country.\" **********Mr. Herson, who spoke on behalf of the Federation Against Inequitable and Regressive Taxation, a group representing dealers of luxury imported cars, said a study done for the organization found that the tax had caused a 20 percent drop in demand for vehicles costing $30,000 or more.

The victims were marched from the city to the ravine, stripped and then killed with grisly efficiency. **********For years, what happened at Babi Yar was ignored by Soviet officials, and Jews who tried to pray at the site were often arrested.

Instead, it marks the spot where the Nazis later tried to conceal evidence of the massacre by burning many of the corpses in a huge pyre. **********The ceremonies on Saturday are to bring together delegations from Israel, Europe and the United States, as well as the top officials of the Ukraine, who seem to have eagerly seized on the Babi Yar anniversary as an opportunity, in part, to score political points with Western governments. **********The Ukraine, which recently declared its independence from Moscow, is now looking for support from the West in its quest to become a sovereign nation.

This contrasts sharply with the situation in other Soviet republics, where there has been violence between ethnic groups. **********As part of this week's activities, exhibits and photographic displays have been set up on the streets of Kiev, describing in detail what happened at Babi Yar. Streamers are stretched across streets that read, in Hebrew and Ukrainian, \"Never Again.\" **********And across the front of the Tchaikovsky concert hall, a giant painting depicts the terrified faces of men and women standing beside a gully of stacked bodies. **********\"When I look at these now, I get an unpleasant feeling in my soul,\" said Lyudmila Kayurova, a 52-year-old Russian woman from Kiev, who was among the crowd viewing the displays near Independence Square in the center of town. \"It was a tragedy for all of us, and only now can we talk about it.\" **********No one knows for certain how many died at Babi Yar during the two years of German occupation. Soviet reports after the war estimated the number at 100,000 -- a toll that also included gypsies, Communists, Christians and Soviet prisoners of war. **********The Ukrainian government has now embarked on a program to improve the situation of Jews in the republic, a place where intolerance -- particularly anti-Semitism -- were powerful forces for centuries before the Nazis came. **********It has said it will reopen two synagogues seized by the authorities years ago and turned into theaters. On Thursday, the government also invited reporters to visit the opening of State School 229, the first Jewish school in Kiev in 50 years. **********According to official estimates, about 150,000 Jews still live in Kiev.

The Treuhand has aroused much anger in the east, and its director, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, was killed by the Red Army Faction three days after the Berlin bombing. **********Depending on which theory one prefers, Thomas Muntzer's Wild Bunch is a gang of disgruntled youths from eastern Germany, or a splinter group of the Red Army Faction, or even a handful of former East German police agents bent on destabilizing Germany. **********Almost as uncertain is the identity of Thomas Muntzer himself. Pioneer socialist or misguided fanatic bent on martyrdom, he is a figure for the unified nation to reckon with as it seeks to come to grips with its history. **********Muntzer was born in 1489, entered the clergy as a young man, and soon joined Luther in his conflict with the established church. But the two quarreled and Muntzer, who claimed to have received a series of divine visions, came to believe that he had been anointed as an apocalpytic messenger of God. **********\"Like Christ, I have been sent by the Father!\" he told ecstatic congregations throughout Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia. \"I come to bring not peace, but the sword!\" Barons Raise an Army **********Early in 1525 Muntzer established a model of his ideal theocracy at the town of Muhlhausen. He issued several decrees on behalf of the poor, distributing free seeds and livestock and confiscating a monastery to house the homeless. **********Then in April 1525 he and several thousand followers set out on a redemptive crusade against the established order. In a single week, Muntzer's peasants, armed only with axes and pitchforks, overran 18 monasteries, 5 castles and the residences of 21 aristocratic families. **********Feudal barons led by the Prince of Saxony quickly sent an army against Muntzer. It surrounded his band on May 14, and demanded his surrender. He refused, rallying his followers with promises that God would protect them. At that moment a brilliant rainbow appeared in the sky. \"Look, God has sent us a sign!\" Muntzer proclaimed. \"Now we know he will help us to punish the murderous Prince.\" **********But there was no divine intervention that day, and Muntzer's crusade came to a violent end. Soldiers fired rifles and artillery until no one was left standing. Five thousand died, and two weeks later Muntzer was beheaded. **********For centuries after his death, Muntzer was remembered, if at all, as a religious fanatic who led his people to disaster. But after East Germany was established in 1949, its leaders began a search for historical icons, and they found Muntzer. **********In the mid-1970's, to mark the 500th anniversary of his birth, the East German authorities chose to build the circular museum that now stands here, overlooking the ravine where his movement met its violent fate. A Portrayal of an Age **********To paint the gigantic panorama inside, the Government commissioned one of its favored artists, Werner Tubke. He and several of his students worked on it for four years. It was finally opened on Sept. 19, 1989, less than two months before the Berlin wall was breached and the Communist Government began to collapse. **********\"The painting is not just a portrayal of Muntzer, but of the age he lived in,\" said Gunter Sickert, a director of the museum. \"It deals with the great human problems of love and hate, war and peace, joy and suffering, victory and defeat.\" **********Some viewers find echoes of Breughel or Bosch in Mr. Tubke's overwhelming work. Many stare intently at sections of it, seeking to decipher biblical or historical allusions. All notice the vivid rainbow that arches over the central battle scene. **********In recent months, however, people from western Germany have been coming to visit the panorama, and not all are so impressed. Some leave muttering that what Mr. Tubke has created is not art at all, but a kind of kitschy monumentalism. **********The Bonn Government has promised that the museum will remain open. Whether the giant painting will remain on display, however, is still undecided. **********\"I would advise that it be left as it is,\" said Leo Seivers, a historian from Hamburg who has written extensively on Muntzer. \"The painting is violent and exaggerated, but it could be preserved as a curiosity or a tourist attraction.\" **********\"Muntzer was portrayed falsely in East Germany,\" Mr. Sievers asserted. \"He was certainly the most radical German theologian of his time, but he is very much a 16th-century figure. The Communists tried to make him into a prototype of the socialist revolutionary. That didn't have to do with history, it had to do with the regime's need for heroes.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/business/business-people-ashton-tate-names-chairman-and-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 331, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ashton-Tate Names Chairman and President", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ashton-Tate Names Chairman and President", "body_text": " **********The Ashton-Tate Corporation yesterday elected William Lyons, the company's current chief executive, to the added post of chairman.

He leaves home at 8 A.M. instead of 6:45, after making breakfast and lunch for his daughters. He leaves the office at 5 P.M., not 7, and does not work weekends. But he still eats lunch at his desk, he says, and \"I go like crazy\" during the work day. **********Mr. Lynch resigned as a director of Fidelity when he left Magellan because \"it was too time consuming,\" he said, and he wanted \"a new challenge.\" Instead, he was elected by other trustees as one of 12 trustees for the Fidelity Funds. **********In this role, he acts as \"scorekeeper, judge and cheerleader,\" he said. \"My job is to make sure that Fidelity shareholders are treated fairly.\" **********Each month, Mr. Lynch and the rest of the equity committee listen to presentations by two stock-fund managers. While they look at whether a fund's investments are in line with its objectives, the big question, Mr. Lynch says, is: Can you tell me the 25 biggest positions in the fund, and why you own them? **********In fact, the trustees met last week to review Magellan's performance under his successor, Morris Smith. How is Mr. Smith doing? \"Great,\" Mr. Lynch said. **********Besides his responsibilities for Fidelity, Mr. Lynch continues as a director of the Morrison Knudsen Corporation and of W. R. Grace & Company, which he joined in the 80's because he was friendly with William J. Agee and J. Peter Grace, the companies' chief executives. When he retired, he was besieged with requests to join other boards, all of which he declined. **********Overall, Mr. Lynch estimates, the Fidelity work takes only one or two working days each month; the corporate board work takes another day or two. The rest of his working time is spent with charities. **********The biggest beneficiary is the Archdiocese of Boston. Mr. Lynch says his best accomplishment this past year is a scholarship program for inner-city students sponsored by the archdiocese. For last February's black-tie fund-raising dinner, Mr. Lynch persuaded companies to buy tables \"to get Boston business to hear the story of the inner-city schools,\" he said. Next year he will serve as chairman of the affair. **********He is also chairman of the investment committee for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and he spent a small amount of time teaching at Boston College. **********Most of his activities require Mr. Lynch to keep up with the financial markets. As for his current thinking on the United States, Mr. Lynch said the economy began to run out of steam a little more than a year ago. The 1990 slowdown would have been a small one, he said, except for the added pressures created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last summer. Now, \"it looks definitely like a good-size recession,\" he said. **********Is a recovery imminent? Mr. Lynch notes that housing is more affordable that it has been in 15 years and consumer confidence is much improved from its low levels of last fall. He concluded: \"All the ingredients are there for a recovery, but there are no signs of it yet. Things will probably look a lot better in 12 months.\" **********As for stocks to buy, Mr. Lynch demurred. \"I'm out of the business of predicting stocks for public consumption,\" he said. **********When he was picking stocks out in the open, Mr. Lynch was on the top of the heap. As he took over Magellan on June 1, 1977, the fund had $22 million in assets. By the time he left, assets totaled $14 billion. **********In that time, Magellan earned an average annual return of 29.3 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds. That is nearly double the 15.2 percent return for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. And while the stock market suffered several setbacks of 10 percent or more during Mr. Lynch's tenure, Magellan never lost money for a full year. **********What does he have to say to fund investors who are looking for guidance? **********First, he recommends long-term horizons. Do not invest money that might be needed in the next year or two, because market behavior for such short periods can be random, he said, adding that \"people who try to get into the market for a quick 10 percent usually end up losing 10 percent.\" It is only over 5 or 10 years that the stock market becomes fairly predictable, he says. **********Investors should also gauge their \"tolerance for pain,\" Mr. Lynch said, because the stock market has dropped at least 10 percent 40 times in the last 70 years, or roughly every two years. Ask yourself, \"what will I do when the market drops?\" he suggests. If the likely response is to sell, do not invest. **********For long-term investors, he is a strong proponent of \"dollar cost averaging.\" Investing small amounts regularly reduces the average cost of fund shares because more shares are purchased when prices are lower. **********Finally, do not overpay for mutual funds. While many financial advisers generate huge commissions by selling funds that carry hefty sales charges, Mr. Lynch said, \"In most cases, there's no correlation between what you pay and what you get.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/25/world/shamir-is-unyielding-on-makeup-of-palestinian-peace-delegation.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shamir Is Unyielding on Makeup Of Palestinian Peace Delegation", "print_headline": "Shamir Is Unyielding on Makeup Of Palestinian Peace Delegation", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir stressed today that Israel should seize the opportunity to attend the American-designed peace conference, but only if no Palestinians from East Jerusalem or with any connection to the Palestine Liberation Organization will be there. **********The Prime Minister said that if it turns out that no Palestinians are prepared to come to a conference on such terms, Israel would be willing to negotiate directly with any Arab country. But he cautioned both Syria and Jordan that they must not expect to get any land for peace -- only peace for peace. **********The thrust of Mr. Shamir's remarks, as well as those made by Palestinians today, suggested that the Bush Administration's initial optimism that a peace conference could be announced when the President meets with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow next week may be premature.  Dispute Over Representation **********It appears that neither Israelis nor Palestinians are prepared to compromise on the longstanding issue of who will represent the Palestinians. And until that is resolved, it is difficult to imagine the convening of a peace conference. **********Equally important, Mr. Shamir held out no hope to the Syrians and Jordanians that if they engaged in direct talks about \"real and true peace,\" they had a chance to regain any of the Golan Heights or West Bank occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. **********The Prime Minister, questioned in a television interview, said: **********\"I do not believe in territorial compromise. Our country is very small. Where would you find among the nations of the world a people who would be ready to give up the territory of their homeland?  'It All Goes Together' **********\"I believe with all my heart and soul that we are eternally tied to this homeland. Peace and security go together. Security, and a territory, a homeland -- it all goes together. That is our belief, that is the belief of the party I belong to and in my opinion, that is the feeling of a large majority of the Jewish nation.\" **********The conditions that Mr. Shamir laid down were not new, but his remarks tonight were important for several reasons. First, they marked his first public comments in Hebrew in reaction to the news brought Sunday by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had all agreed to take part in a peace conference with Israel. **********Up to now, Mr. Shamir has been quoted by aides as saying optimistic things in private or to various visiting American groups. **********But when it came to addressing his own constituency in Hebrew, it was clear that the news that Syria was ready to attend a peace conference that would open the way for the first direct talks with Israel was not something so enticing to Mr. Shamir that he is prepared to drop his conditions on Palestinian representation, or to suggest even the remotest hope of a territorial compromise.  Separate Deal With Syria? **********Second, his comments were important because they suggested that Mr. Shamir already realizes that it may be impossible to bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians over how the Palestinians should be represented, and he is already trying to offer Syria the sort of separate deal that Israel struck with Egypt in 1978 at Camp David, Md. -- but without offering the Syrians a chance to recover their occupied land, as the Egyptians recovered Sinai. **********There is no indication at this stage that the Syrians would accept such a separate negotiation. They have said the opposite in public. Thus, if Mr. Baker does not find a way to resolve the question of Palestinian representation, it is hard to see how a conference can begin. **********The Israelis say they will not formally agree to attend until they get a list of Palestinians from the United States. American officials say they are waiting for the Jordanians and Palestinians to agree on a joint delegation. **********Mr. Baker, when he spoke with three Palestinian representatives in Jerusalem on Sunday, told them that while he sympathized with their plight, the realities of power in the Mideast now were such that if they wanted to take part in negotiations, they would have to essentially accept the Israeli conditions.  Baker Proposal Rejected **********He tried to make it easier for them by asking Israel to agree that no East Jerusalem Palestinians would be in the opening round of talks, which will be limited to the question of autonomy for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But they can be in discussions later, when the final status of the territories will be decided. The Israelis rejected this idea, as did the Palestinians. **********\"We told Mr. Baker that the United States does not recognize the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem, so how does he expect us to?\" said Hanan Ashrawi, one of the West Bank Palestinians who has been meeting with Mr. Baker. **********\"There is no Palestinian -- credible or incredible -- who will be prepared to take part in a peace conference in which no Palestinians from East Jerusalem are allowed,\" he said. \"It is a matter of substance. It means accepting the Israeli annexation.\" **********In a parallel diplomatic move, the French Foreign Ministry announced today that Faisal al-Husseini, the other leading West Bank Palestinian involved in talks with Mr. Baker, was coming to Paris tonight for talks with the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, on the Palestinian representation issue. French Help Sought **********Palestinians say Mr. Husseini will try to enlist French help to soften the American and Israeli positions, something that will not be greeted warmly by Mr. Baker, who has had a monopoly up to now on the diplomacy. **********Mr. Shamir made it quite clear that for him this issue was non-negotiable. He will only talk to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or to Palestinian refugees living in Jordan and carrying Jordanian passports. **********To talk to Palestinians from East Jerusalem or Palestinian refugees from abroad, he argues, would be to admit that East Jerusalem is negotiable and that Palestinian refugees have a right to return to their homes in Israel as the country existed before the 1967 war. **********In Mr. Shamir's view there are only two solutions for the Palestinians. One is for those living in the West Bank and Gaza to accept an autonomy arrangement that recognizes Israeli rule and the other is for those living in Jordan to remain there as Jordanian citizens and for Israel and Jordan to reach a peace agreement between them. 'This Is Our Right' **********\"We must know who are the people who will compose the Palestinian delegation within the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation,\" the Prime Minister said. \"This is our right. Under no circumstances can they be from East Jerusalem. Jerusalem, united in its completeness, is the capital of Israel.\" **********The Palestinians reject such conditions, asking: In what negotiation in history can one side demand to choose the other's delegation? **********\"They don't agree with us and for now, because of this, there is no Palestinian-Jordanian delegation,\" Mr. Shamir said. \"We know this process will not begin until all the parties agree to take part in it. But you know something: I am prepared to negotiate only with Syria, with all the Arab states. I don't need them all.\" **********Asked if that meant he was was ready to go to a conference that did not have Palestinians there, Mr. Shamir replied: \"As far as I am concerned, yes.\"  A Package Deal **********The problem the United States now faces, though, is that it has presented the peace conference, and sold it in the Arab world and Israel, as a package. Politically, the Arab countries need the Palestinians there to cover their own direct talks with Israel. **********It would be very difficult now for the United States and the Soviet Union, the co-sponsors of the conference, to simply issue invitations, as Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were hoping to do at their summit meeting in Moscow that begins Tuesday. **********First, they have no one to send the Palestinian invitation to at this point, and second, Mr. Shamir warned them not to try to paint him into a corner by demanding that he agree to the conference and leave the detail of Palestinian representation to be worked out before the talks open in October. **********Mr. Shamir said Mr. Baker explained to him that the Syrians had decided to accept the conference out of recognition that they had to put themselves in the good graces of the United States now that the Soviet Union was in decline and America was the world's only real superpower. **********President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt was also driven to break from the Arab consensus and offer peace with Israel in the late 1970's out of a desire to gain American favor and aid, Mr. Shamir indicated, but he said there was one important difference. **********\"Sadat,\" the Prime Minister said, \"started his move with an appeal to Israel, not to the United States.\" **********\"He came to Jerusalem, to the Knesset, and said to the Jewish nation: 'I want peace with you, I understand your security problems,' \" Mr. Shamir said. \"Assad has not said that up to today. He turned first of all to the Americans, and only the Americans. Up to now he has not spoken at all about peace. He talks about 'resolving the dispute.' It is not the same thing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/business/company-news-goods-seized-by-microsoft.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 255, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goods Seized by Microsoft", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Goods Seized by Microsoft", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation said today that it, in conjunction with United States marshals, had made a large seizure of counterfeit software.

The company reported a loss of $39.6 million in 1990, and $24.1 million in the first nine months of this year, not including an extraordinary gain it recorded from buying back bonds at a discount. **********In the world of broadcasting, of course, profits under generally accepted accounting principles are often not deemed to be an achievable goal, and managements urge investors to ignore the depreciation of intangible assets. What counts, they say, is cash flow. **********The proposed public offering values the company at 11.7 to 12.3 times its 1990 cash flow, incorporating WFAN's results. That multiple evidently will be somewhat lower for 1991, because Infinity's results improved slightly in the first nine months of this year, while WFAN's moved up significantly. **********Infinity obviously thinks there is plenty of room for improvement in operations at WFAN, which carries Mr. Imus weekdays from 5:30 to 10 A.M., and all-sports programming the rest of the time: the games of the New York Mets, Knicks and Rangers, and a host of sports talk shows. **********The figures included in the prospectus for the offering indicate that WFAN had cash flow -- before interest expenses and before management overhead -- of $4.6 million on revenues of $21.4 million in 1990. At $70 million, Infinity is paying 15 times that cash flow. **********In fact, WFAN's results are improving. For the first nine months of 1991 it reported cash flow of $6.4 million on revenues of $20.7 million. Because the prospectus does not give comparable results, and because the fourth quarter is not an especially strong one for WFAN -- with baseball over and the two local professional football teams on other stations -- it is not possible to estimate the multiple being paid based on 1991 cash flow. **********By the standards of a few years ago, when deals relied on rapidly advancing ad revenues or soaring prices of radio stations, this deal is conservative. But its success still seems to be dependent on capital markets remaining friendly. **********The pro forma financial results indicate that had this deal been done at the beginning of 1991, and the bonds repurchased then, Infinity would have had operating cash flow of $9.8 million, for the first nine months, even after paying its interest expenses. If the fourth quarter is that good, that would leave $13 million of cash flow available for the year, compared with a margin of only about $3 million in all of 1990. All figures ignore capital spending, which is running at better than $1 million a year. **********Unfortunately, $13 million will not be good enough in 1992, because the company is scheduled to repay $16.9 million of long-term debt that year, a figure that rises gradually each year to $21.5 million in 1994, and then zooms to $252.9 million in 1995, when Infinity will have to refinance its operations. **********One aid to 1992 cash flow may be the proceeds from the sale of Infinity's current AM station in New York, WZRC. After converting from a Spanish-language format in 1990, that station now plays rock music, but it does not have enough listeners to be included in the Arbitron ratings. Under Federal Communications Commission rules, Infinity will have to sell WZRC after it completes the acquisition of WFAN. Infinity has asked for a one-year waiver in order to avoid an abrupt sale. **********It may be encouraging to prospective buyers of Infinity shares that insiders at the company are not taking out cash from the offering. In fact, they put cash into the company at the end of September, enabling the company to repurchase bonds at a discount. **********But those insiders, who include management and Lehman Brothers, which is underwriting the new offering, did not pay retail. Their price was about $12 a share, or a discount of 25 to 33 percent from the price being asked of the public investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/07/world/rome-journal-retiring-a-token-makes-big-issue-of-small-change.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1991-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rome Journal; Retiring a Token Makes Big Issue of Small Change", "print_headline": "Rome Journal; Retiring a Token Makes Big Issue of Small Change", "body_text": " **********Obscured by oddments like the Persian Gulf crisis and Western Europe's latest gyrations toward unity was a recent notice that a small piece of Italian tradition is about to fade away. **********The small piece is known as the gettone, a ridged copper token that has been used for more than five decades to make calls from pay telephones. It is a simple device that makes it unnecessary to rejigger the phone's internal mechanism whenever the rates change. **********But the phone company considers the gettone to be outmoded, and says that by the end of next year it should be phased out almost entirely, giving way to machines that accept only coins or prepaid, magnetically coded cards, which have been steadily gaining popularity here. **********France had similar tokens, jetons, and there was reportedly little mourning when they started to disappear a few years ago in favor of the magnetic cards. But some Italians expect the reaction here to be a bit different. In Italy, the gettone is an integral part of the daily routine, not just for making phone calls but also for clearing life's many unexpected hurdles. Accepted as Currency **********While technically it is not legal to use a gettone as currency, everyone accepts it as a full equivalent to a 200-lire coin, or about 18 cents. That is no paltry matter in a country where the search for a shopkeeper with small change sometimes makes Ahab's pursuit of the white whale seem like a fish-shoot in a barrel. **********The problem was acute a decade ago. Small coins all but disappeared, forcing stores to make change with pieces of candy and baubles. Since then, the situation has markedly improved. Still, many storeowners despair of the long lines that await them at local banks, and so they try to avoid going there even if the result is a coinless cash register. **********Under such circumstances, the telephone token looms large as a coin of last resort, so much so that one restaurant owner in Rome says he will resist to the end before giving up his gettone-only pay phone. **********Many of his regular customers are prominent politicians and assorted hangers-on, some of whom belong to the fast-shrinking tribe of Rome residents who do not walk about with cellular phones attached to their ears. These people need a public phone that works, the restaurant owner says, and his gettone machine has withstood the test of time. To him, the new telephone cards are a form of electronic alchemy, inspiring no confidence. **********He is not alone in doubting phone company innovations. Some Phones Don't Work **********The company's surveys show, for example, that one pay phone of every 12 on Italy's streets does not work. But many people suspect that the ratio is appreciably higher, given the lamentable state of public services that, most Italians admit, are the bane of this, the world's sixth largest economy west of Minsk or east of Vladivostok. **********Actually, until the other day Italy thought it was the fifth largest. **********The country had puffed out its chest five years ago when it seemed to have moved up a notch, thanks to a statistical recalibration that took account of the sizable underground -- look out, here comes the tax collector! -- economy. There it was, \"il sorpasso,\" the overtaking of Britain that put Italy behind only the United States, Japan, Germany and France. **********But a European Community report this week told Italians that, sorry, the figures had been rechecked, and it seems they are really No. 6 and they have been No. 6 throughout the last five years, once factors like real purchasing power are taken into account. A Downbeat Mood **********Whatever its proper place, Italy has entered palindromic 1991 in a decidedly downbeat mood. Opinion polls show that Italians foresee a worsening economy and a high probability of yet another Government collapse, not to mention that they worry like everyone else about a gulf war. **********But there are bright spots, and one is that a sixth-place economic force cannot be expected to have the same level of public services as a fifth-place power. That is some consolation, however scant, for the millions of Italians who have had it with late-running trains, strike-bound planes, phones that fail, health services that further afflict the afflicted and mails that go through now and again. **********According to Corriere della Sera, a respected national daily, only 52 percent of all telephone calls here reach their intended destination -- odds that are slightly better than one can find at a casino blackjack table. Many calls that do get through are suddenly cut off, or, more commonly, the connection sounds as though the person on the other end is crinkling an empty potato-chips bag against the mouthpiece. Improvement in Mail **********As for the mails, the latest Government figures show rapid improvement. Two years ago, it took the average letter 8.5 days to go from one point to another in Italy. Now, the post office says, the delivery time has been trimmed, on average, to 4 days and 15 hours. One could also note, however, that a person with one foot in a bucket of scalding water and the other in a pail of ice water is, on average, comfortable. The post office average includes fairly common deviations like a letter from New York that was postmarked June 27, 1989, and arrived in Rome the following April 19. **********A report last month by Censis, the country's principal gatherer of statistics, concluded that Italians were fed up with the poor quality of their public services. There is a \"new culture of saying no,\" Censis said, adding that more and more people are crying out, \"Basta\" -- \"Enough.\" **********At the phone company, executives agree, and say that is why they are pouring billions of dollars into a modernization program that should, within a few years, raise Italian telephone services to the ranks of the best. Getting rid of the gettone in favor of zippy electronic cards is merely one part of the process, they say. **********\"The gettone,\" said Carlo Dellepiane, a senior company official, \"is antiquated.\" **********So, Italians say with a heavenward roll of the eyes, are stable phone rates. In mid-January they go up again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

The King urged Mr. Hussein to \"spare everyone bloodshed and catastrophe\" by withdrawing from Kuwait. **********He also said a negotiated solution to the conflict between Iraq and Kuwait was still possible -- after Iraq withdraws its forces.  Readiness for War **********In response to a reporter's question, King Fahd implicitly warned President Hussein that if he did not withdraw, Saudi Arabia would be prepared to use force, with its allies, to insure Iraq's departure from Kuwait and the restoration of stability in the region. \"We are sure, God willing, that peace will be realized -- either way,\" he said. **********Asked if he would go along with a possible agreement between Iraq and Kuwait that would give Baghdad the use of Kuwait's two islands in the Persian Gulf or some disputed territory, King Fahd said that first Iraq had to withdraw. \"Then, if there is any demand, the two countries should sit together and discuss the matter between themselves,\" he said. \"Whatever they agree on, we will support.\" **********His position mirrored that of the Bush Administration. Earlier in the crisis Prince Sultan, the Defense Minister and a brother of the King made remarks that were widely interpreted as a suggestion to Kuwait that it cede some territory to Iraq. This idea was quickly repudiated by senior American and Saudi officials, eager to dispel any impression that anything short of total and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal was unacceptable. The King's insistence today on withdrawal as a precondition to any negotiations over territory underscored that point.  Visit to Military Base **********King Fahd gave this assessment during a visit to King Khalid Military City, a vast military complex about 60 miles southwest of the Kuwaiti border. Asked whether he shared President Bush's feeling that Iraq would withdraw its forces at the last minute before the United Nations deadline, King Fahd replied: \"I do share with President Bush his instinct and his hope. And I hope Saddam Hussein will take the important step and withdraw from Kuwait and spare everybody the bloodshed and catastrophe of war.\" Mr. Bush said in an interview in last week's issue of Time magazine that \"my gut says he will get out of there,\" **********In the strongest defense to date of his decision to invite largely non-Muslim foreign forces to come to this center of Islam, King Fahd rejected assertions that the large international presence here risked destabilizing his highly conservative kingdom. \"We have taken the right step,\" he declared. \"We still know it's the right step. We don't have any instability. The people who objected are those who supported Saddam Hussein from the beginning.\" **********King Fahd said that Saudi Arabia had \"an understanding\" with all countries that had sent forces here that \"once the crisis is over, all the troops will go back to their homes.\" But, asked how he would protect his country in the future, he did not rule out a future foreign presence. \"There is always a way to negotiate and discuss and make agreements in the future so things like what happened now will not be repeated.\"  On Throne Since 1982 **********The 69-year-old Saudi ruler, a cautious and normally retiring leader, has ruled the country, containing about 40 percent of the world's oil reserves, since 1982. **********In his visit to the international force, King Fahd first reviewed 1,000 American and 500 Saudi soldiers with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the United States ground forces here, and then, in a separate ceremony, some 5,000 troops from Britain, France and several Islamic countries that have also sent forces. **********The review was his first since the crisis began more than five months ago. It was also the first time in the crisis that he has met with and answered questions from Western reporters. These rare gestures came nine days before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations Security Council in a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait. It also seemed intended to blunt growing criticism from Congress and Middle East analysts of the size of Saudi Arabia's financial contribution to the effort to defend the kingdom and force Iraq to leave Kuwait. Congress is scheduled to debate the use of force against Iraq and related issues later this week.  'A Wonderful Gesture' **********General Schwarzkopf, speaking to reporters shortly before the troop review, said King Fahd's visit was \"a demonstration that we are all in this together.\" Asked whether he thought the King should have come sooner, the general replied: \"Who am I to tell kings what to do? They're really busy people. It's a wonderful gesture he's coming out here to see them now.\" **********The review of the troops was organized quickly on less than 48 hours' notice, officials here said. American forces were summoned to this base at Hafr al-Baten only yesterday to begin rehearsals. While some American officers said they were delighted that Saudi Arabia did not seem to share the embarrassment of other gulf states about the presence of so many American soldiers in this region, others seemed slightly irritated by the short notice, the changes in review procedures just before the King's visit, and the interruption of their military preparations and exercises. Anthems Are Played **********The King's visit began with the review of Saudi and American soldiers, who stood across from each other on the giant tarmac of the Hafr al-Baten air base. After the Saudi and American national anthems were played, King Fahd and General Schwarzkopf rode in the back of an open jeep on this cold, crystal-clear day past soldiers of the 22d Support Command, the band and color guard of the Army's First Cavalry Division, army engineers, a hospital company, quartermasters, the 766th Transportation Company of the Indiana National Guard, and a signal battalion. A smiling King Fahd, wearing a light brown, gold-embroidered cloak and traditional Saudi headdress, waved once to the troops, but did not address them. **********He then drove in a 50-car motorcade at breathtaking speed some 40 miles across the barren desert, where his party, which included more than 100 members of the royal family, ministers and friends, reviewed some 5,000 soldiers standing at attention in formation behind their national flags and signposts indicating their countries in English and Arabic. There were no American soldiers at this gathering, although a signpost for the Americans had been prepared and was lying alongside the formation. **********One officer said that the Americans had not come to hear the speech at this review because they had been paid a special tribute by their own review earlier in the day. **********The King delivered his speech in Arabic -- a 45-minute long account of his role in the crisis -- from a Bedouin-style tent pitched over luxurious Arabic carpets less than 500 yards in front of the soldiers. The King and General Schwarzkopf and other commanders of the foreign forces sat on high-backed chairs with thick, embroidered cushions, in front of which was a coffee table adorned with fresh roses and boxes of tissues. Incense scented the air. As the reporters selected by the Saudis for this rare visit with King Fahd crowded around the tent, the King uttered a few words of welcome in English, and answered eight questions in Arabic. **********He also invited those reporters present to return to the kingdom as his guests after the crisis was over, \"to see the development we have achieved in this great country.\" **********In his account of the crisis, King Fahd suggested that he had been personally betrayed by President Hussein, who he said had repeatedly assured the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, in Baghdad before the crisis that he meant Kuwait no harm. **********The King said that since he and Mr. Hussein had met in 1975, the Iraqi President had \"called me every other day,\" to say that because of his help to Iraq, \"they considered me a hero.\" Suddenly after Aug. 3, the King said, \"I became in his eyes a terrible man.

Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. \"But at the moment there does not seem to be any clear sign of overwhelming retail demand. Do investors believe that this is about the end of the decline, and that rates could turn around?\" Lower Yields Expected **********Despite the seeming lack of enthusiasm by investors, Mr. Griggs and other analysts said the recession and an anticipated sharp slowdown in inflation this year would probably push bond yields lower. **********\"The bullish posture of the dealer community is absolutely appropriate,\" said James M. Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management Group, a Mountain View, Calif., firm with a fixed-income portfolio of $7.5 billion, most of it in Government securities. \"The bond market rally is real. The weakness in the economy is clearly evident, and talk about a turnaround this spring looks like a hope to me, not reality. I think bond yields are destined to fall to 7.75 percent at least and possibly as low as 7 percent by year-end, depending on what the economy does and how the Fed responds.\" **********Because the drop in short-term rates has been so much more pronounced than in bond yields, Mr. Benham said more and more investors in his funds were lengthening the maturity of their holdings to capture additional yield.  Salomon Assessment **********\"The most compelling argument in favor of lower yields stems from the forces that are undercutting inflation,\" Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted in the firm's weekly newsletter Comments on Credit. **********Because of the recession, wage pressures are easing, Mr. DiClemente said. And a slowdown in other industrial economies, many of them crucial American export markets, will impede a quick recovery in the United States. **********Still, there are signs that investors, who grew increasingly conscious of credit quality as 1990 progressed, are now willing to take on more risk in exchange for yields that are much higher than those offered on AAA-rated Treasury securities. **********Despite the recession, prices of a wide variety of corporate bonds have been rising for much of the last month, from high-yield \"junk bonds,\" to medium- to high-quality corporate issues. Corporate Yields at a Low **********Corporate bond indexes compiled by Merrill Lynch show that yields on high-quality corporate bonds with maturities of 10 years or more are now at 52-week lows, at just over 9 percent. So, too, are yields on riskier investment-grade corporate debt, securities rated A to Baa. At the end of last week, Merrill Lynch's index showed those issues were yielding about 9.80 percent. **********The improvement in the corporate market has much to do with the overall decline in interest rates. But analysts said the declines in many corporate issues in the fourth quarter turned them into bargains. **********\"In the fourth quarter the whole corporate market got cheap, too cheap relative to the economic fundamentals,\" said Thomas J. Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch. **********\"With the general level of bond yields down, and the fact that long Treasuries are now yielding under 8 percent, investors have been given a reason to take on incremental yield.\"  Views on Corporate Market **********Given the economic outlook, participants in the corporate market said prices would probably improve further. **********\"For the first time probably since 1982, people think they should buy corporates because the Fed is lowering rates and, while credit quality looks bad now, it will improve in six or seven months,\" said one corporate bond trader. \"Prices in this market are not the equivalent of being 6 percent or so from their all-time peak, as they are in the stock market.\" **********Analysts said that upcoming economic reports this week should be favorable to prices in almost all fixed-income markets. **********\"We are looking for a whole string of weak numbers, from industrial production to retail sales to producer prices,\" said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. \"If we get that string, the market might begin building an expectation that the Fed will ease again before the end of February.\" Possible Stumbling Block **********The producer price report that Mr. Slifer referred to might prove a stumbling block. **********Most analysts, including Mr. Slifer, anticipate that the Producer Price Index for January, which is expected to be released on Friday, will show that prices fell last month, in large part because of a decline in energy prices. **********Some analysts noted, however, that much of that decline occurred after the onset of fighting in the Middle East. In early January, the period when data for the report were collected, wholesale gasoline prices actually rose, they said. **********As a consequence, Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, is estimating that producer prices probably rose by two-tenths of a percentage point last month, after a decline of six-tenths of a point in December. **********Excluding food and energy, however, the core inflation rate probably increased by a mere one-tenth of a percentage point, Mr. Jones said, compared with an increase of three-tenths of a point in December."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/business/forum-an-issue-of-consumer-privacy-and-corporate-retreat.html": {"writer_name": "John Baker", "pub_date": "1991-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Issue of Consumer Privacy . . .

Rather, it should depend on two things: what the impact of that information use would be on the consumer, and the sensitivity of the information. **********In MarketPlace, the information was not very sensitive; direct marketing databases are just names and addresses, selected by computer-modeled demographic analysis. And the information they generate is used to provide consumers with offers of products and services. **********Consumers seem to want those benefits. A 1990 survey commissioned by Equifax and conducted by Louis Harris & Associates and Alan F. Westin, a privacy expert, found that when the direct marketing process is explained to consumers, a 2-to-1 majority of respondents considered it acceptable for companies to use information about them in order to conduct direct mail marketing. **********Although concerned about threats to privacy, respondents said they were willing to make trade-offs in the use of personal information. For example, 67 percent of respondents found it acceptable for companies to buy data -- names and addresses of people in certain age groups, estimated income groups and residential areas -- so as to mail offers of products and services to people they think will be interested. When they were told that names of people not wanting to receive offers by mail could be deleted from mailing lists, acceptability jumped to 88 percent. **********Direct marketing is used by businesses and consumers because of convenience, low cost and diverse merchandise.

Other U.S. broadcast and cable networks also should find new outlets here, as will Western film studios and record companies. **********Japanese electronics companies will enjoy growing sales of equipment to receive satellite broadcasts, although already the majority of sales are for gear incorporated into televisions or videocassette recorders, rather than separate units. This tends to trim profit margins. Half the Japanese population is expected to have access to satellite programming by 2000, either with home receivers or via cable hook-ups, the National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan estimated. **********Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. look like the biggest winners, cashing in twice: by selling equipment and by syndicating programming from the American movie and record companies they bought in recent years. Sony acquired CBS Records and Columbia Pictures (now Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.) and Matsushita took over MCA Inc., owner of MCA Records and Universal Studios. **********Japanese commercial broadcasters will be hardest hit.

This optimism about the currency, however, does not translate into an eagerness to buy dollar assets. Portfolio managers say prices of U.S. stocks fully reflect the expected recovery, while bond prices are not expected to match the gains foreseen in European markets. **********About the most optimistic estimate for the dollar, which ended last week at 1.6765 Deutsche marks and 129.80 yen, is Citibank's forecast of 1.90 DM and 139.50 yen by year-end. National Westminster sees the dollar at 1.70 DM and 131 yen at the end of the year and then rising steadily throughout 1992 to reach 1.90 DM and 139 yen. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's DKB International sees dollar weakness immediately ahead against the mark with a year-end forecast of 1.62 DM but a recovery against the yen to 140 and then steadily higher dollar rates throughout next year. **********Michael Cowan, an asset allocation manager at Morgan Stanley Asset Management in London has no quarrel with the view that the dollar is headed up. \"The dollar is cheap on its long-term purchasing power parity basis. We think that will be corrected, and the dollar rally will reassert itself,\" he said. **********At the same time, he considers the U.S. bond market \"one of the least attractive of all the major markets.\" **********Yields on 10-year U.S. government notes ended the week at 7.38 percent. Using Morgan Stanley's estimate that inflation is not likely to fall much below 4.5 percent, the real yield would thus be below 3 percent. **********That may be the typical real yield looked at over a 30-year perspective, but it is unattractivem compared with what is available in other markets, Mr. Cowan said. Indeed, inflation-adjusted yields outside the United States are now so high that Morgan Stanley's normal asset mix of portfolios - half in stocks and half in bonds - has been tilted to 55 percent in bonds and only 45 percent in equities. **********\"Equity markets are expensive relative to long-term trends,\" Mr. Cowan said. \"Over the last 15 years, world equities typically traded at 1.6 times book value and 6.2 times cash flow but at the moment those ratios are 2 times book value and 8.2 times cash flow.\" Book value is basically the net value of a company's assets minus its liabilities, and cash flow is a measure of income available after certain deductions such as interest payments. **********With the current ratios, equities are expensive, Mr. Cowan explained, particularly compared with the high real yields of around 5 percent now prevailing in bond markets. \"The fact that you can get higher real yield from bonds than one has typically achieved over the last 30 years indicates the bond market is a good place to park money at the moment,\" he said. **********The markets he likes most are Germany, Britain, France, Finland and Japan. **********\"We're most keen on German bonds,\" he added, with \"very attractive yields currently at 8.5 percent and inflation estimated at 3 percent over the next five years. That indicates real yields of 5.5 percent.\" **********Mr. Cowan estimated that 25 percent of his bond portfolio is invested in Deutsche mark bonds, considerably more than the 7.5 percent share that German bonds account for in Salomon Brothers' World Bond Index. On the other hand, U.S. bonds, which account for 51 percent of the Salomon index, make up only 38 percent of Mr. Cowan's portfolio. **********But given the outlook on the currency, the dollar exposure in the bond portfolio is closer to 62 percent, since a quarter of the nondollar holdings have been hedged into the U.S. currency. **********\"We have money in Italian, Finnish and Danish bonds, which are not represented in the index at all but make up 10 percent of our bond holdings, so we consider we are taking some big bets,\" Mr. Cowan said. **********As far as maturity, he said the bond portfolio overall has a life of 4.8 years, relatively long measured against the three-year span he considers to be the \"neutral\" position. Holdings in U.S. and Japanese bonds average 3.5 years, British bonds five years and German and French bonds seven years. **********\"At some point next year we believe German rates will fall.and we want to be locked in with long maturities,\" he said. **********The bulk of the equity investments are in U.S. stocks, which account for 45 percent of the total. But again investments in European stock markets are larger than their weightings in the Morgan Stanley index. German stocks account for 7 percent, compared with an index weighting of 4 percent; Swiss stocks 6 percent, compared with a 2 percent weight in the index; and Finnish stocks take 3 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent weighting. **********The equity holdings are not hedged on a currency basis, but Mr. Cowan notes the companies chosen all have substantial dollar revenue. **********Alan Saunders, head of investment strategy for Union Bank of Switzerland's private banking clients in London, has 60 percent invested in bonds for income-oriented dollar accounts and 40 percent for portfolios geared to aggressive capital growth. **********About 60 percent of the bond portfolio is in European markets, with Italian, Spanish, French and European currency unit bonds accounting for the bulk. Mr. Saunders has omitted German bonds, seeing better value in the higher yields of neighboring countries. He also has up to 10 percent in cash and invested short-term to benefit from the inverted yield curves in many European countries that have pushed short-term returns above those available in long-term investments. **********\"At the moment we're happy to run European exposure for dollar accounts. At some stage we'll need to hedge into dollars, but for the moment we feel pretty relaxed about it,\" he said. **********For European investors, three-quarters of the bond investments are in European markets with the remainder about equally split between U.S. and Japanese bonds. **********At Banque Julius Baer in Zurich, Helmut Sauer said bonds make up 70 percent of conservative portfolios, 55 percent for riskier accounts. \"We have a strong conviction that most bond markets will do well over the next six months,\" he said. **********For Baer's European clients, Ecu, French franc and sterling bonds account for a third of total bond holdings. French and British equities also account for a large part of the stock investments. **********\"Declining inflation will buoy the bond markets, and the decline in interest rates will help the equity markets,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/business/worldbusiness/IHT-high-rates-and-ratings-cool-singapore-bourse.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1991-07-16", "snippet": "After surging in the first few months of 1991, the Singapore stock market is being dragged down by rising interest rates and a perception that it is over-valued relative to other regional markets.

But banks are more wary now because the market is in decline and the Monetary Authority of Singapore has advised banks it was unhappy with the speculative fever their lending helped arouse. **********The Singapore government is forecasting economic growth of between 6 and 8 percent in 1991, after adjustment for inflation. Earnings of most Singapore companies, however, \"will reflect subdued economic conditions\" in the United States, Europe, Japan and other major markets, said Ang Chor Chen, an analyst with DBS Bank Ltd. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Ang said prospects looked brighter for 1992, and any correction in the Singapore market should be seen as an opportunity to buy. **********IN THE FIRST HALF of the year, the performance of Singapore stocks was among the most impressive in the region. The DBS 50 index increased by 24.1 percent, outpaced only by the Manila Stock Exchange with a gain of 62.6 percent and the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which rose 24.9 percent. **********In the same period, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index went up by 22.3 percent, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong by 21.3 percent and the Jakarta Stock Exchange by 17.1 percent.

The cartel office decided against the purchase, but was overruled by the East German government in favor of Allianz. **********Mr. Sch\u00f6n said that the cartel office had needed a concrete new development to look closer at competition in the insurance industry of a united Germany, and this was provided by the news that Allianz had boosted its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest. **********The Allianz chairman, Wolfgang Schieren, speaking at a press conference in Munich on Tuesday, confirmed earlier reports that his company had lifted its stake in Dresdner Bank to approximately 23 percent. The stake had previously been estimated to be anywhere between 10 percent and 20 percent. **********Normally the cartel office can only rule against a purchase if it involves a stake of more than 25 percent. Now, an amendment passed last year allows the cartel office to block a purchase if it decides that a stake of even less than 25 percent may give the purchaser effective market dominance. **********In the case of Dresdner Bank, for example, the cartel office would consider not only the 23 percent stake of Allianz but an additional stake held in the bank by Munich Reinsurance. **********Since Allianz and Munich Reinsurance have mutual cross-holdings amounting to 25 percent of each other's stock, the cartel office is expected to consider whether the two may effectively work in tandem to exert a powerful voice in Dresdner Bank's affairs. **********The cartel office will focus its investigation primarily on the insurance industry even though Allianz and Dresdner Bank have also been cooperating on financial services. Two years ago Allianz and Dresdner Bank agreed to jointly market various banking and insurance products, joining the movement where customers are able both to bank and to buy insurance at the same address. **********Allianz also announced on Tuesday that its premium income rose by about 20 percent to 38.3 billion Deutsche marks ($21.9 billion) in 1990 and predicted that it should rise a further 25 percent to 48 billion DM in 1991. Due to heavy payouts required by spring storms last year, however, profits dipped slightly to 1.006 billion DM in 1990 from 1.157 billion DM the year before. **********An exact forecast for profit growth was hard to make, Mr. Schieren said,because of uncertainties in Eastern Germany."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/10/business/worldbusiness/IHT-world-stock-exchanges-pledge-selfregulation.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1991-10-10", "snippet": "Executives of the world's major stock exchanges formally endorsed the virtue of self-regulation Wednesday at a time when their Hong Kong hosts are in the midst of a bitter standoff with local regulators..

And one of the biggest has been the fat of the American banking industry. Creaking under the strain of collapses, such as that of the Bank of New England around the turn of the year, the U.S. banks had to shake themselves up or die. **********Over the year 1990 an index of bank stocks compiled by the Wall Street firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods plummeted 33 percent, compared to a 7 percent fall in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Now the roles are reveresed, thanks to a merger wave that has been sweeping over the American banking system - one that is already looking very different from last year's model. **********The mergers have helped to make bank stocks among the hottest investment plays in U.S. stock market this year: An index of 50 bank stocks compiled by Salomon Brothers, the New York investment house, has surged by nearly 50 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with only a 17.5 percent rise by the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index. **********What's more, the merger binge, which so far has involved five of the 10 largest American banks, is believed to have only just begun. Before it is finished analysts say that the 12,300 U.S. banks that currently exist could be reduced to 6,000 or less. **********Analysts say the consolidation forces that are currently reshaping the U.S. banking system are not only more powerful than anything that has hit the industry before but they have also turned the traditional merger-related investment strategy on its head. **********Traditionally, profiting from mergers within a particular industry has meant focusing on targets. **********The hope was to find a company too weak to protect itself from a powerful predator who could pay several times the target company's book value to win control. In such circumstances, the target company's shareholders would reap a windfall while the stock price of the predator would slump. **********But in the current merger spree \"the focus has shifted to the acquirers,\" said Richard Stillinger, an analyst at the Keefe Bruyette and Woods. **********\"The market is saying that those banks likely to benefit most from the merger trend are those that are already performing strongly within their market,\" Stillinger said. **********A perfect example was the recent BankAmerica takeover of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp. **********BankAmerica, one of the strongest and the most profitable U.S. banks, acquired the troubled Security Pacific for essentially its book value - or the value of its assets minus it liabilities. In the mid-80's, banks would routinely pay merger premiums of two or even three times book value to acquire a target. **********In addition to being able to buy a rival at a bargain-basement price, acquirers such as BankAmerica benefit by being able to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in costs from the combined bank consolidating overlapping operations. Such cost savings, according to analysts, will sooner or later translate into higher earnings. **********Thus in each of the major U.S. banking mergers to date - BankAmerica's takeover of Security Pacific, Chemical Bank's acquisition of Manufacturer's Hanover, and NCNB Corp.'s purchase of C and S/Sovran Corp.-the predator's stock price has surged. **********The alternative strategy of focusing on weak banks as merger candidates is extremely dangerous, analysts said. **********\"Some weak banks are totally dependent on a turnaround in the real estate market over the next 12 months in order to survive,\" said Antony Polini at A.G. Edwards and Sons, a St. Louis-based securities firm. \"Those are not the kind of dice I like to roll,\" he said. **********Analysts said strong banks that are potential acquires in the current merger wave are Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and Key Corp. in the Northeast; NCNB Corp. and First Union Corp. in the Southeast; Bank One, NBD Bancorp and Northwest Corp. in the Midwest; and BankAmerica and Wells Fargo and Co. on the West Coast. **********In the initial stage of the merger spree, the focus is on \"in-market\" mergers - this is, mergers between banks in the same market. **********Such Mergers like ManufacturersHanover and Chemical Bank deal in New York, present the greatest opportunity for immediate cost savings because the overlap in branch networks and other operations is substantial. **********Other such in-market deals reported or rumored to be pending include a merger between the bank of Boston and Shawmut National Corp. in New England, National City Corp. and Ameritrust Corp. in the Midwest and Wells Fargo and First Interstate Bancorp in California. **********But the ultimate result of the merger wave is expected to be a system similar to that in Britain or Japan where unlimited nationwide branching allows banks to become much larger. **********In that way the merge spree, by eliminating excess capacity and making banks less economically dependent on any one region, is expected to make the beleaguered U.S. banking system much healthier. **********Mr. Polini of A.G. Edwards said a second wave of mergers will focus on banks seeking to extend their market reach, to an adjoining state or to another area of the country. He said investors can play this stage of the game by either betting on acquirers or targets. **********Likely targets, he said, are those banks that are \"strong players in local markets but not in their region and could therefore fit well into a larger company.\" **********Specifically, he said banks that are either first or second in market share in their state or region but still relatively small - meaning $10 billion or so in assets - will be natural takeover targets. **********Specific companies fitting that bill, he said, include Signet Banking Corp. in Virginia, which has $12 billion in assets, UJB Financial Corp. in New Jersey with $13 billion in assets and Michigan National Corp. in Michigan with $11 billion in assets. **********The key point in shopping for U.S. bank stocks, analysts say, is to buy quality at a reasonable price. Stocks with big takeover premiums already built into their price should be avoided. **********\"Banks that are good performers in desirable markets are good merger bets,\" said Mr. Stillinger of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \"But they are also good investments if a merger does not occur,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/15/business/worldbusiness/IHT-ec-may-punish-deficits-with-refundable-fines.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Goldsmith", "pub_date": "1991-10-15", "snippet": "The European Community, searching for a way to discipline member countries that run up big budget deficits in the future, is leaning toward a system of refundable fines as a sanction..

Then, the superior reporting resources of U.S. networks forced Japanese networks to rely on CNN and other U.S. broadcasters. The American networks gained effective control of Japanese airwaves as rapidly as U.S. fighters took control of Iraqi airspace. **********Mr. Shima envisaged GNN as a 24-hour English-language news service based in New York that would gather news footage from Asia, Europe and the United States. Each center would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing on its own region. **********GNN was more than a challenge to the rapidly expanding market share of CNN and the BBC. By surrendering editorial responsibility to different regions, it was also a plea for a more pluralistic approach to broadcast journalism. **********Mr. Shima believed that while Asia should accept news filtered by Western reporters and editors, Asians should cover issues about Asia. Japan, if only out of necessity, would take the lead role. **********But the quest for a broader Japanese role in the global information order sparked fears, both at home and abroad, of a potential backlash in Asia, a region still bitter over Japanese atrocities earlier this century. NHK's satellite broadcasts, which spill over into parts of South Korea and other neighboring nations, have elicited official complaints from Seoul, which maintains an official ban on Japanese culture. NHK was forced to narrow the footprint of its broadcasts to prevent their reception abroad, but succeeded only partially because of the long and narrow shape of the Japanese archipelago. **********The proposal of Mr. Shima, who resigned earlier this year amid charges he lied to parliament to cover up a sexual liaison, also met suspicion among Western broadcasters critical of mainstream Japanese journalistic reporting, which tends to be scant on criticism or analysis and often numbingly long on detail. **********For these and other reasons, NHK had a hard time finding partners and found itself unable to foot annual costs estimated at more than 100 billion yen ($778 million.) \"It seemed feasible until the summer,\" Mr. Kawaguchi said, \"but now setting up GNN is totally out of the question.\" **********Instead, NHK plans to pursue a scaled-down version of GNN, a type of Asian news pool that would aim to boost the quality and exposure of Asian newscasts. \"My ambition is to upgrade cooperation with Asian broadcasters to put Asian broadcasting in the top ranks,\" Mr. Kawaguchi said, adding that NHK also would seek to use more Asian-produced programs on daily life, culture and art. **********The attempt to carve out a greater Asian role for NHK comes as CNN and BBC are plugging into new satellite technology to expand their reach in the region. CNN says it serves more than 150,000 private homes and about 70,000 hotel rooms in Asia. Its coverage is set to broaden with the addition of broadcasts from Indonesian and Japanese satellites. **********The BBC also stepped into the competition in October with its 24-hour World Service Television. Its signal is beamed from Asiasat, a satellite whose mammoth signal reaches a potential 3 billion viewers from Turkey to Japan. Although the BBC's broadcasts come in only faintly in Japan, they were seen by many here as an infringement of Japanese sovereignty. **********Neither CNN nor the BBC expect to reach more than a tiny fraction of the massive Asian audience. Not only do most Asians not understand English well enough to enjoy watching newscasts in English, but it is also illegal for individuals to own satellite receiving dishes in China, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore. **********But the transnational broadcasts could challenge the monopoly on news held by the region's mostly state-run broadcasters and provide competition that would sharpen NHK's skills. \"We welcome the BBC venture,\" Mr. Kawaguchi said. \"But we think we will reciprocate later,\" he added, hinting that NHK would eventually move onto the international broadcast scene in some form."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/03/your-money/IHT-theoretical-debatewaving-or-drowning.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-03", "snippet": "LIKE doctors disputing the meaning of a set of X-rays, two investment advisers who publish global-market newsletters have peered at their charts and tables and made opposite prognoses for the Hong Kong stock market.

The market's price of 1.17 times book value is well below its five-year average of 1.60, meaning the Hang Seng could reach 5,500, were it to trade at that average ratio. **********\"Once again, among the major markets, only Hong Kong looks attractive,\" he wrote. **********The market that Mr. Melton sees as undervalued is in danger of an imminent crash, if you ask Robert Prechter Jr., editor of Prechter's Global Market Perspective, published in Georgia.

During the last few years, the wave took the shape of the dread \"diagonal triangle.\" **********\"The drop following a diagonal triangle is usually dramatic and powerful,\" he wrote. \"A few more points are all that is required to finish the pattern, so the potential for severe decline over the next few years is very high.\" **********Mr. Prechter seemed pleased that shares fell about 10 percent in the course of a week.

Yet only Hong Kong is expected to see corporate earnings increase this year. **********WITH THE AIRPORT AGREEMENT and thus a new modus vivendi between Britain, Hong Kong and China, Mr. Narain predicts that the Hong Kong market's P/E ratio should rise as high as 14, led by foreign institutional investors who have stayed on the sidelines for the most part during the airport imbroglio. **********Even a rise to the relatively conservative ratio of 12 would bring the Hang Seng index to a record 4,100 by the end of the year and to 4,900 by the end of 1992, if the 19 percent earnings growth predicted by Mr. Narain and other brokers for next year is accurate. **********But other brokers point out that the Hong Kong exchange, even though it may trade at a discount, still has been one of the world's top-performing markets since the beginning of the year. **********\"One doesn't really like the market to storm up so quickly,\" said Clive Weedon, research manager at ChinTung Securities Ltd, one of the colony's top brokers. \"That is not healthy. One should always keep an eye on overseas markets. No market as cheap as this can go it alone forever.\" **********Mr. Weedon believes the airport deal will mostly benefit companies outside Hong Kong and may strain the finances of the Hong Kong government, which has promised to leave at least $3.2 billion in its Treasury when the Chinese take over in mid-1997. Already, he said, the government has cut back its spending on infrastructure projects to save for the airport, leaving local construction companies in the lurch. **********He recommends local property companies such as Cheung Kong Holdings and Henderson Land because they specialize in residences that are being snapped up by Hong Kong Chinese who want to secure housing before 1997."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/business/worldbusiness/IHT-murky-statistics-cloud-east-german-picture.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Smith", "pub_date": "1991-08-14", "snippet": "New industrial production figures show a confusing pattern in Eastern Germany's struggling economy, making even the government skeptical about any trend as yet..

However, Mr. M\u00f6llemann's comments caught many observers by surprise because Bonn usually leaves the Bundesbank free to set monetary policy.] **********Economists generally doubt that the economy in Eastern Germany will turn around until early next spring. After that, growth is expected to be halting and fragile. **********Such impressions may have to remain without a solid statistical foundation for some time, however, because current figures cannot be seasonally adjusted or compared in the usual way to figures from the previous year, federal statisticians said. **********They noted that it also takes longer to make calculations about Eastern Germany. Industrial production figures for June, for example, may not be ready for another month. **********Mr. M\u00f6llemann, often adept at finding rays of hope even in the Eastern German economy, said in a press release that the new figures do not yet unmistakably show whether the drop in industrial production has bottomed out. **********The new figures show that industrial production in May was 39 percent lower than its level in the third quarter of last year, the best comparable period. **********One of the few discernible patterns appears to be a steady revival in the category of stone and gravel processing, a reliable barometer of the construction industry, which in turn is often an early signal of general recovery."},

"document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arab-Expulsion Party in Israel's Cabinet", "print_headline": "Arab-Expulsion Party in Israel's Cabinet", "body_text": " **********After a long and angry debate, the Israeli Cabinet today voted to accept as a new member of the Government a small right-wing party that advocates expelling all the Palestinians from the occupied territories. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir pushed through the appointment of the Moledet Party -- the Hebrew name means homeland -- over the opposition of senior members of his Government to expand his coalition to 66 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. That is considered a safe governing majority. No longer will any but the very largest of the minor parties have the power to bring the Government down. **********Mr. Shamir has said that like other Cabinet ministers and like members of the opposition, he disagrees with Moledet's platform and will not allow the idea of \"transfer,\" as mass expulsion is euphemistically known here, to be discussed in his Government. Still, the appointment adds a sharp right edge to a Government that is already the most right-wing in Israel's history. **********Several of the most senior members of the Government -- the Ministers of Justice, Health, Finance, Defense and Foreign Affairs -- voted against the new coalition agreement or abstained, participants at the meeting said. Vote totals from the closed meeting were not disclosed.  Charges of Racism **********In several cases, dissenting ministers said they considered the Moledet Party to be racist. And they openly worried that the move would jeopardize Israel's new-found international standing as a result of its military restraint in the face of Iraqi missile attacks. **********\"The view represented by Moledet is one that we reject out of hand,\" said Health Minister Ehud Olmert, a close adviser to Prime Minister Shamir. \"It is a moral distortion and is likely to bring a moral stain onto the Government.\" **********Opposition politicians said they were appalled. **********\"This will cause terrible damage to the state, especially since we are now protesting against the racism of Saddam Hussein and the racism of Germany,\" said Ran Cohen of the leftist Citizens' Rights Party. **********A recent national survey by the Hanoch Smith research concern, taken in December, found that 49 percent of the nation's Jews favor expelling the Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip if no peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict is found. Forty percent disagreed with that idea. **********The Moledet Party's leader, retired Gen. Rehavim Zeevi, will be a minister without portfolio and, more important, a member of the ministerial committee on defense and security. Just after the vote, Mr. Zeevi said he would set up a committee to advise Mr. Shamir on security matters, as Mr. Shamir had requested.  Arabs to Get Gas Masks **********As the Cabinet was voting on the Government's new members, the army announced that it had decided to begin large-scale distribution of gas masks to Palestinians in the West Bank. **********The last four Iraqi Scud missiles fired at Israel, including two Saturday night and this morning, have fallen near Palestinian communities in the West Bank, although no one has been injured in any of those attacks. **********Just before the war began Jan. 17, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the army to distribute gas masks to all 1.75 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. The army objected, saying the masks would not be needed since Iraq seemed unlikely to target Palestinians. **********But when the court learned that all of the roughly 100,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied territories had already been given gas masks, it ordered that they be distributed to the Arabs, too. **********Only then did the army reveal that it had only about 175,000 masks for the Palestinians, 10 percent of the number needed. In any case, on Jan. 15 all of the Arab residents of the territories were put under house arrest, meaning they have not been allowed to leave their homes for any reason without permission. So the distribution of even the few masks on hand has been held up; about 50,000 of those had been distributed before today. **********Today, Brig. Gen. Freddy Zach, deputy administrator of the military government in the occupied territories, said masks would be given first to those Palestinians living in areas where the recent missiles have fallen, near Tel Aviv.  Support for Hussein Cited **********Explaining the 20-day, open-ended curfew, which Arabs say is having devastating effects on their economy, General Zach noted that the Palestinians still support President Hussein. **********\"They still believe that eventually he will win,\" the general said. \"They still believe that he has the secret weapon, that he can destroy half of Israel as he had promised several months ago.\" **********At the same time, a Jerusalem court today ordered that the jail sentence for Sari Nusseibeh, a leading Palestinian political figure jailed on a charge of spying for Iraq, be cut in half -- from six months to three. **********Last week, the army accused Mr. Nusseibeh of passing data to Baghdad through the Palestine Liberation Organization detailing where Scud missiles had landed, so the Iraqis could improve their targeting. Mr. Nusseibeh vigorously denied the charge, and after viewing the state's secret evidence today, the court decided that the sentence was excessive. **********A judge ruled that the army had no reason to hold Mr. Nusseibeh any longer than the Persian Gulf war lasted, which the judge decided would be no more than three months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/08/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-southwestern-bell-unit-names-five-finalists.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Southwestern Bell Unit Names Five Finalists", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Southwestern Bell Unit Names Five Finalists", "body_text": " **********The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, St. Louis, has named five finalists in a review meant to improve the integration of its business advertising and direct marketing accounts.

Mr. Bush said last week he was not inclined to authorize the guarantees, but officials said Mr. Shevardnadze might have helped sway Mr. Bush during their talks at the White House today. **********The new loans would supplement $1 billion in credits guaranteed by the Commodity Credit Corporation last December when the Administration waived the restrictions prohibiting preferential trade treatment with nations that restrict emigration. Moscow has already spent nearly all of the original credits. **********Mr. Shevardnadze linked the future of Soviet politics to the uncertain economic situation and the possibilities for increased cooperation with the West. He echoed a request that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, made in a recent letter to the Agriculture Department for $1.5 billion in new credit guarantees. **********\"This is a very acute issue with us now,\" Mr. Shevardnadze said, \"and I want to say quite straightforwardly that a decision which will be taken in Washington will to a large extent determine the fate of reform and democracy in the Soviet Union. I want to stress this, that we have very little time.\" **********Mr. Shevardnadze, in an interview after his meeting at the White House with Mr. Bush, said he had consulted with Mr. Gorbachev before visiting Washington, but he insisted that he was not carrying a message from the Soviet leader. Mr. Shevardnadze said Mr. Bush listened attentively to his appeal but did not commit himself one way or the other. **********\"But I had the impression he understands how acute this question is with us,\" he added. **********But Mr. Landsbergis said he would counsel Mr. Bush against extending new loan guarantees until Moscow liberalizes its policies. \"It shouldn't be given to the Soviet Union to prevent it from adopting a path of dictatorship,\" he said in an interview. \"It should only be given after it demonstrates that it is going down the road of democratization.\" U.S. Recognition Urged **********Mr. Landsbergis said he would tell Mr. Bush when they meet on Wednesday that Lithuania needs Washington's formal diplomatic recognition to prevent another Soviet military crackdown against his breakaway republic. The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 1940 as a result of a secret pact with Nazi Germany. **********Prime Ministers Edgar Savisaar of Estonia and Ivars Godmanis of Latvia are also scheduled to meet with Mr. Bush this week, even as American officials began analyzing the meaning of a meeting that Mr. Gorbachev had with Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media executive, in which he upbraided the Administration for pursuing policies that seemed to undercut his authority. Mr. Gorbachev's comments were carried by the Soviet press agency Tass. **********A State Department official said: \"There is a sensitive, delicate political balance here between supporting Baltic aspirations for independence and keeping our lines open to the Soviet leadership. That's not always easy to do.\" **********Administration officials have said they are undecided on the latest plea for grain credits, expressing concerns that it would be unwise to extend them to Moscow at a time when its creditworthiness is questionable. \"We are not helping them by creating another Poland financially,\" the State Department official said. But he acknowledged that Mr. Shevardnadze's advice could strengthen Mr. Gorbachev's case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/world/summit-london-pact-reached-reduce-nuclear-arms-bush-gorbachev-meet-this-month-7.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Gorbachev in Moscow late this month. **********Then Mr. Gorbachev, the proud leader of the nation where Communism first flowered, sat down with the heads of the seven most powerful capitalist nations and asked them for help in reforming an economic system that has all but collapsed. Almost 75 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet President's pleas represented an admission of economic failure. **********Mr. Gorbachev laid his plans before the Western leaders in what another participant described as \"an eloquent performance.\" Officials taking part in the closed meeting reported that Mr. Gorbachev insisted that Soviet progress toward a market economy and private ownership of property was irreversible, but that he made no new proposals. Gorbachev's Courage Hailed PHE> **********Nevertheless, Mr. Gorbachev won praise from the leaders of the seven countries -- the Group of Seven. Mr. Bush said the Soviet leader had shown \"enormous courage\" in pushing ahead with reforms. **********\"It's not going to be quick or easy to implement change in the Soviet Union,\" Mr. Bush said after the meeting, \"but we believe President Gorbachev has made an irrevocable commitment.\" **********Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, who played host to the group's 17th annual economic summit meeting, said: \"This has been a day I believe that history may well see as a landmark. It will be seen as a first step toward helping the Soviet Union become a full member of the world economic community.\"  [ Excerpts from the Bush-Gorbachev and Gorbachev-Major news conferences, and from the summit's economic declaration, are on pages A10 and A12. ] **********The Moscow meeting was tentatively scheduled for July 30-31. **********Under the provisions of the arms treaty to be signed there, the overall number of nuclear weapons in each side's arsenal will be cut by 25 to 35 percent. The American arsenal will be reduced from about 12,000 warheads and bombs to about 9,000, while Moscow's stockpile is to be reduced from roughly 11,000 to roughly 7,000. **********While Mr. Gorbachev made no specific requests for immediate financial assistance, officials of several nations said, and left little time for questions, he asked the group to \"take a step forward\" in developing greater cooperation with his country. **********\"The ice has started moving; the icebreaker is on its way toward renewal,\" the Soviet leader told reporters later. But he quickly added, \"There is need for movement from the other side,\" meaning the West. **********Mr. Gorbachev came away with the prospect of a bit more Western aid than had seemed likely a few days ago, including pledges of a \"special association\" with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, extensive programs of technical assistance and an early visit to Moscow by the group's finance ministers to discuss further measures. But he won no promise of major infusions of cash. **********In addition, German officials promised that they would invite the Soviet leader to attend next year's economic summit conference in Munich, and President Francois Mitterrand of France said that he favored ultimately asking the Soviet Union to join the club, making it a Group of Eight. **********At the news conference tonight, Mr. Major said the meeting had established \"a partnership with the Soviet Union on a new and better footing,\" as a first step toward Moscow's integration into the world economic system. **********Mr. Gorbachev called the three-hour session \"one of the most important meetings of our time.\" **********\"Today has meant a lot,\" the seemingly weary Soviet leader said. **********\"It's been a good day for the United States,\" Mr. Bush replied. A Qualified Success **********Merely by winning admission to the forum of capitalist leaders this week, Mr. Gorbachev can claim a victory. But some things that most of the participants would have liked to give him, including full membership now or soon in the International Monetary Fund and greater drawing rights at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, were blocked by the United States and Japan. **********Mr. Gorbachev had to overcome American opposition and that of hard-liners in his own country to gain an invitation to London. Still, some members of the Gorbachev delegation expressed open disappointment today with what he had achieved. One said that \"the Soviet Union doesn't understand Western economics, and the Western nations don't understand Soviet politics.\" **********Still, the arms accord is likely to help Mr. Gorbachev with his increasingly restive people, as it will free scarce resources for domestic concerns. **********By the time that the strategic arms reduction treaty is carried out, probably in 1999, the number of American warheads on weapons that can reach the Soviet Union will drop by about 25 percent, and the comparable Soviet total will fall by about 35 percent. The treaty puts sub-limits on various weapons systems and is particularly tough on the Soviet SS-18 missile, the most powerful in either arsenal. **********For two days, the prospect of Mr. Gorbachev's arrival here had hung over those attending the conference -- the leaders of Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Italy, Germany and Japan. Today, as his motorcade of Zil limousines flashed across central London from one meeting to another, he utterly dominated the scene, eclipsing and in some cases eliminating debate on other issues. **********The summit conference never really came to grips with the environment, referring discussion of global warming and the rain forests to a United Nations conference next year on the subject and thus avoiding an all-out clash between the United States and the Europeans, especially Britain. Tariff Issue Deferred **********On another difficult matter, described by everyone as crucial, the group merely pledged to complete by the end of the year the current round of talks designed to bring up to date the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is precisely what was promised in Houston a year ago and not delivered. **********Mr. Major, who presided over this week's sessions in a bright and breezy way that contrasted sharply with the stern, hectoring manner of his predecessor, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it had been \"a friendly and very frank summit.\" He added, \"People did speak their minds clearly and comprehensively and on occasions in an unforgettable way.\" **********Much of the groundwork was laid before today. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, had resolved all outstanding questions on the all-important arms treaty, except one technical issue, at a series of meetings in Washington that ended Sunday. That related to the definition of a new missile, in terms of its throw-weight, or destructive capacity, for treaty purposes. **********White House aides said Mr. Bessmertnykh asked this morning for a meeting with Mr. Baker just before Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were to meet for lunch at the United States Ambassador's residence. A senior American official said the Foreign Minister brought new proposals, and after a flurry of conferences, the President and his advisers agreed that the final obstacle had been overcome. 'Our Hospitality' **********Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev spent most of their lunch discussing economic and other matters, then slipped into an adjoining room to ratify what had been agreed to on arms. **********Beaming, the two men met briefly with reporters, Mr. Gorbachev saying that his country was \"ready to give our hospitality to the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush.\" He had sought the Moscow meeting for the last year. **********\"Before you change your mind, we accept with pleasure,\" replied Mr. Bush, who had held out for the treaty as a condition for making the trip. **********Neither side was willing to specify what the final arrangement was, because neither wanted to appear to have made the final concession, lest it be seen as soft by the legislative hard-liners in Washington and Moscow whose backing will be needed if the treaty is to be ratified. **********British and American experts said the difficulties in reaching agreement were more political than military. The Soviet Union is believed to be developing a more advanced, more powerful version of one of its missiles. **********The Administration wanted to head that off, remembering the deployment of the SS-19 after the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Critics of the 1972 agreement charged that its negotiators had failed to get tight enough language. Gorbachev Explains His Country **********At his meeting with the Group of Seven, Mr. Gorbachev made no specific requests for monetary aid. **********\"He really was trying to explain more what was going on inside the Soviet Union, what the pressures were, what he was up against in terms of history, if you will,\" Mr. Bush reported. \"He really stopped short of what some predicted might be on his agenda.\" **********Mr. Major reportedly opened the meeting by telling the Soviet leader: \"You are among well-wishers. The challenges you face are formidable, but the opportunities are limitless.\" **********He said candidly, however, that the West expected reform in property rights, market prices, the breakup of state monopolies and the establishment of a Western-style legal system. **********Mr. Gorbachev, in turn, spoke of the need to dismantle barriers to the Soviet economy, including trade restrictions and lack of access to loans. **********Daniel Bernard, the French spokesman, described the Russian's presentation as a \"particularly rich\" 30-minute speech that dealt with the relationship of the Soviet republics to the central Government in Moscow and with his own reform intentions. **********A British official said Mr. Gorbachev's explanation of his economic policies today was not significantly different from the plan detailed in a 23-page letter he sent to the seven leaders last week. **********According to one official, Mr. Gorbachev's one-hour opening statement this afternoon and his remarks at the news conference tonight were not \"very specific on details.\" **********He left unclear, this official said, the answers to such questions as exactly how the Soviets intended to privatize state-owned enterprises and liberalize controlled prices. **********\"There was movement in the right direction,\" an official said, adding that Mr. Major would try to get clarification during his talks with Mr. Gorbachev here Thursday. **********In a briefing tonight, Mr. Gorbachev's chief spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, disclosed few details of the private discussions today. He did say that Mr. Gorbachev had discussed the need to create a stabilization fund to bolster the ruble, as a way to more quickly complete the conversion of the ruble on international currency markets. However, he did not seek Western aid for such a fund. \"Today was not the occasion\" for that, Mr. Major explained. Status of Soviet Republics **********Mr. Ignatenko said Mr. Gorbachev spoke at length about the relationship between the central Government and the republics, and assured Western leaders that he had a mandate to speak for all the Soviet Union in his attempts to press forward with an agenda of economic reform. **********A six-point program of assistance was ultimately agreed on, but some of the points struck economists as imprecise and redundant, an attempt to make a small package look bigger. The Western summit partners committed themselves to these goals: ***********Setting up the special relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, leaving it up to the institutions and the Soviet Union to negotiate the terms. ***********Urging other international organizations to make their knowledge and skills available to Moscow. ***********Offering technical assistance to help the Soviets exploit energy resources, improve food distribution, increase nuclear safety, make their transportation system more efficient and convert military industries to civilian ones. ***********Helping expand trade with the West and with Eastern European nations. ***********Sending Mr. Major to Moscow before the end of the year to check on the progress of reform and, if appropriate, to recommend further Western aid. ***********Sending the finance ministers' group to Moscow very soon. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which has supplied most of the Western aid to the Soviet Union in the last year, had hoped for bolder action. But he spoke of \"a good start.\" **********Mr. Mitterrand said \"we must, really must, reach out,\" and his aides said that he, too, would have liked to do much more to help the beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev than was agreed to in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/23/business/briefs-711591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 257, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Air France, the state-owned airline, will receive two billion francs, or about $400 million, of new capital from the French Government in 1991 as part of the effort to help the company through the current downturn. * Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., New York, the technology and management consultant, will acquire Spicer & Oppenheim Consultants, London, a financial services consultant, for undisclosed terms. * British Steel P.L.C., London, said it would cut a further 1,100 jobs at its Scottish Ravenscraig steel works and operate only one blast furnace at the plant. * Campeau Corp., Toronto, the real estate and retail company, will sell its Hippodrome Blue Bonnets properties in Quebec to the Societe d'Habitation et de Developpement de Montreal, a municipal agency, for $46 million (Canadian). * Champion International Corp., Stamford, Conn., a producer of building materials and paper products, reduced the quarterly dividend payment on its common stock to 5 cents a share from 27.5 cents.  * Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., said its president, Philip Benton, would undergo coronary bypass surgery in the next few days.

The charges concern activities that occurred in 1986, when the market was booming. **********In the filing, Shearson said that as part of the settlement it would accept a censure from the Big Board and provide the exchange with a written report detailing the findings of an audit of the procedures and controls in Shearson's margin loan department.  'In Compliance' **********A spokesman for the firm said yesterday that Shearson had tried to correct any problems at the branch. \"The matters in question occurred virtually five years ago,\" the spokesman said. \"The firm has long since taken the steps to insure that the branch is in compliance with all relevant regulations.\" **********The settlement was a strong blow to the salesmen at the Water Street branch, which some employees said acted virtually as a separate entity from the rest of the firm. The branch \"had a fairly lax atmosphere,\" one Shearson executive said yesterday, speaking on condition that his name not be used. **********Employees at Shearson and other Wall Street executives said that the charges included accusations that purchases were made for customer accounts without the knowledge or permission of the clients. If clients objected to the purchases, the securities were often \"parked\" in a series of inactive accounts, Wall Street executives said. The securities were said to have been improperly held in those accounts until they were subsequently sold to another customer or into the marketplace. **********Those activities were only part of a larger series of rule violations. Wall Street executives said that, because securities were being purchased without permission and sold into inactive accounts, the branch failed to keep proper books and records and also failed to characterize the trades correctly in its records.

In churning, a broker will buy and sell securities excessively, thus increasing commission income for the broker. **********The Big Board accusations also focused on claims that the Water Street branch improperly extended margin loans to clients seeking to buy securities. The Water Street branch was said to have allowed customers facing heavy losses more time than they would have been allowed under the rules of the exchange to put up additional cash to avoid having securities sold. **********Some changes have occurred at the Water Street branch since the investigation by the New York Stock Exchange began last year.

But a cease-fire between the national army and Slovenia's militia generally held. **********Senior officials of the Croatian and Serbian republics said their forces were girding for a possible war with each other after two days of fighting between police officers and ethnic Serbs in Croatia.  An Ambiguous Warning **********In Belgrade, the national capital, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, Yugoslavia's Defense Minister, said that army units were being harassed by Slovenian forces and that the military would soon propose \"appropriate decisions\" to Yugoslavia's collective presidency. **********But in an ambiguous statement, he strongly hinted that the army would not oppose Slovenia's secession. He said his troops' most important task was to disarm rapidly growing local militias. **********On Slovenian television, Vasil Tupurkovski, a member of Yugoslavia's collective presidency, warned: \"Tensions are very high both in Slovenia and the rest of the country. Everything could collapse with a small incident, because the passions and emotions are enormous. **********\"I hope that reason wins out with everyone: with those in Slovenia, those in the Yugoslav presidency and at the top of the Yugoslav national army.

I am convinced that war is in no one's interest.\" **********Bluffing and bluster are part of politics in the Balkans, and tough talk is frequently followed by last-minute accord. It was not clear whether today's round of contradictory statements was a prelude to compromise or conflict. **********The most immediate potential flash point was noon Sunday deadline set by the collective presidency for Slovenia to relinquish international border posts. **********The Slovenes took control of customs stations along the country's northern border after voting to secede from Yugoslavia on June 25, and held them in the face of an attack by Yugoslav Army forces. The border posts are viewed in Slovenia as a symbol of sovereignty.  Fighting Leaves 60 Dead **********In the fighting, which reached its fiercest point on Tuesday, 60 people have been killed, including civilians, militiamen and soldiers, and 288 wounded. **********After a brief cease-fire, Yugoslavia's collective presidency agreed to return the army to its barracks but demanded that Slovenia release captured soldiers, dismantle roadblocks and give up the border posts. The presidency set a series of deadlines for compliance with its demands, but did not say what would happen if Slovenia defied the order. **********So far, the Slovenes have refused to accept a compromise proposed by the national Government under which the Slovenes could keep the border posts but would give the customs revenue to the Government. **********Many Slovenes believe that the army is poised to impose the presidency's deadline with a crushing show of force. **********Still, it appeared today that the Slovenes' intransigence might be part of a negotiating strategy under which they would present their fallback positions on Sunday in a meeting with European Community observers who are now in Yugoslavia.  Consequences Not Specified **********Stipe Mesic, the Croat who heads the presidency, insisted today that the army has no authority to move against the Slovenes, and would not do so without civilian approval. The presidency's ultimatum does not specify the consequences if Slovenia refuses to accept its conditions. **********General Kadijevic, the Defense Minister, said in his nationally televised address that the army would seek the presidency's approval for any steps, suggesting that Mr. Mesic had indeed succeeded in restoring some measure of civilian control. **********Military intentions remain a subject of intense speculation, which was only deepened by the general's remarks today. Some say the army is simply trying to play a role as mediator, but many in Croatia and Serbia see it as predominantly the tool of the Serbs. About 70 percent of its officer corps is of Serbian origin; its foot soldiers are conscripts from all the republics.  Placatory Words From General **********General Kadijevic acknowledged that the operation against Slovenia had been a mistake and asked: **********\"Why would soldiers of other nationalities die in Slovenia if, for the Slovenes, they are foreigners and occupiers? It is not our goal to kill Slovenes if it is not their desire to live in Yugoslavia.\" **********In Croatia and Serbia, however, the talk today was of war. **********Croatia's Information Minister, Hrvoje Hitrec, said in an interview that fighting between the two republics could break out within days and if it did, it would make the initial fighting between Slovenia and the national army look like \"Disneyland.\" He said that Croatia has canceled all leaves for doctors and drawn up plans to mobilize 100,000 reservists within hours. **********Mr. Mesic said that fighting between Serbia and Croatia could result in thousands of casaulties.  Restive Serbian Minority **********Croatia, the second largest of the Yugoslav republics with 4.7 million people, has a Serbian minority of about 600,000 within its borders. The Serbs have stepped up their challenge to the Croatian government since Tuesday's declaration of independence. **********Croatian police officials charged today that many of the armed men attacking local police officers and militiamen live in Serbia.

In February he had reached agreement with bankers to change the terms on much of his $8.2 billion in debt.  TV Guide Is Not in Deal **********Although the agreement with the banks did not specify asset sales, analysts had always assumed that $800 million or more would have to be raised for him to be able to meet his obligations. **********The partnership, called K-III Holdings, is buying nine publications, the most profitable of which is The Racing Form, a daily newspaper that has covered thoroughbred racing nationwide with no serious competition. **********The other publications are Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Weekly, New York, Seventeen, Premiere, European Travel & Life, Automobile and New Woman. Mirabella, the fashion magazine, and TV Guide were not part of the sale, the people said.

Like the heads of many other media companies, both domestic and foreign, Mr. Murdoch determined to expand his company internationally in the 1980's, presumably on the theory that only big global companies would prosper. Media executives justified that expansion on the theory that their properties generated so much cash that they could comfortably pay off part of the debt they had incurred, or, if neccessary, sell some properties at ever-rising prices to meet those obligations. **********In the United States alone, Mr. Murdoch bought the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Metromedia's televison stations, TV Guide, a variety of magazines and book publishers. **********But by this year Mr. Murdoch's cash flow was insufficient to meet debt payments and he was forced to sign the agreement with the banks to renegotiate his loans. **********To some degree, the theory has proved true that diversification within media would pay off. Fox's movies \"Home Alone\" and \"Edward Scissorhands\" were both surprise hits. Because they were relatively low-budget films and were highly profitable, they took some of the pressure off the News Corporation. But not enough to avoid a substantial sale of assets. **********And so last month, after much speculation, the magazines were put on the market. Mr. Murdoch, perhaps because he was so aware that in the current economy it would be hard to sell the unsuccessful properties, was determined to sell all the publications as a group.  Interest From Other Buyers **********A number of buyers were apparently interested, including Reed International, the British concern that has been expanding its American publishing business and whose properties include Variety, the entertainment trade paper. **********But the sale was not easy because a number of Mr. Murdoch's magazines do not make money, according to proprietary data. **********Of those that do, The Racing Form is by far the most profitable, having had cash flow last year of $25 million, according to industry estimates. **********Soap Opera Digest is also considered a desirable property. Last year it had $15 million in cash flow on sales of $37 million.  Magazine Business Struggles **********Mr. Murdoch sold his publications for about 10 times their last year's cash flow, or the cash the magazines generated. That is a relatively low multiple compared with what the publications might have fetched in the 1980's. Mr. Diamandis said the going rate was about seven times cash flow. \"In the late 1980's, the multiples were as high as 15 times cash flow,\" he said. **********Soap Opera Weekly is a relatively new publication that is barely making money. **********The data on New York magazine reflect not only how difficult the magazine business has become, but particularly how tough the New York market is. Last year the weekly publication had cash flow of $7 million on revenues of $47 million. Its cash flow was down from $9.7 million a year earlier, and its revenues were relatively flat. **********On the other hand, some magazines, like Seventeen, have prospered despite new competition from publications like Sassy. The monthly magazine aimed at teen-age girls had cash flow of $9.6 million last year on net revenues of $47 million. That profit was up from $8.4 million a year earlier.  Losses for New Publications **********The data also indicate how difficult it is to start a new publication and how long it takes before that publication makes a profit. For example, Premiere, a magazine that covers the movie industry, lost $1.6 million last year on revenues of $14.5 million. Although it continues to lose money, the losses have declined. The previous year it had lost $5 million on sales of $11 million. **********European Travel & Life also continues to lose money, having a negative cash flow last year of $984,000. Still, that figure is down sharply from the previous year's loss of $2.4 million, giving some indication that eventually it may become profitable. **********Mr. Murdoch did not sell TV Guide, which many industry experts say was Mr. Murdoch's biggest acquisition error. The News Corporation paid $3 billion for a publication considered to have been worth $2 billion or less. **********K-III Holdings was formed in February 1989 by Kohlberg, Kravis and several former executives at Macmillan Inc., the publishing and information services company. Since then it has been involved in various acquisitions or proposed acquisitions in publishing. In May 1990 it bought Ward's Communications, which puts out a highly regarded auto industry newsletter, and in December it bought the assets of Field Publications and Funk & Wagnalls."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/business/bank-deposit-fund-nearly-insolvent-us-auditor-says.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1991-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1468, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK DEPOSIT FUND NEARLY INSOLVENT, U.S. AUDITOR SAYS", "print_headline": "BANK DEPOSIT FUND NEARLY INSOLVENT, U.S. AUDITOR SAYS", "body_text": " **********The nation's top auditor said today that many more banks were effectively bankrupt than regulators had recognized, and that therefore the program that insures depositors was \"nearly insolvent.\" **********The official, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, suggested that a quick way to fix the fund, which is financed through premiums paid by banks, would be to raise $15 billion through additional contributions from the banking industry. **********\"The bank insurance fund is nearly insolvent, and I cannot overemphasize how important it is to restore it as quickly as possible,\" Mr. Bowsher told the Senate Banking Committee. \"If you don't get on top of this soon enough, then the taxpayers will eventually lose.\"  40 Cents for Every $100 **********To raise $15 billion quickly, Mr. Bowsher urged Congress to consider an immediate special assessment on banks of 40 cents for every $100 in deposits. He said that if the lawmakers found this would unduly restrict lending by the banks, Congress might consider levying an assessment of 20 cents in 1991 and again in 1992. **********In either event, he strongly urged the Senators not to put a cap on existing annual premiums at 30 cents for every $100, as the Bush Administration has proposed. **********The $15 billion increase could be used by the fund both to bail out insolvent banks and to borrow against, thus further strengthening the insurance program. Existing law permits the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which operates the fund, to borrow up to nine times its net worth. The law also gives the agency a credit line of $5 billion with the Treasury. Audit Used Regulators' Files **********Economists for the White House and for Congress have relied upon economic models to determine the net worth of the bank insurance fund, and their findings have predicted that the program may run out of money within a year or two. But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress that Mr. Bowsher heads, conducted an audit that was based on information from the regulators' own files. The results of the audit, presented at the hearing today, showed that the fund and the banking industry were in far weaker condition than previously calculated. **********Mr. Bowsher's testimony was the most dire of any Government official in a long series of hearings over the last year. In the hearings, a progressively worse picture of the plight of the insurance fund has emerged. **********Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the chairman of the Banking Committee, said the G.A.O. had found that \"the bank insurance fund is essentially out of money.\" **********\"We're in a position of some real vulnerability,\" said Mr. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan. **********But the proposal made by Mr. Bowsher today provoked only criticism in Congress and from the industry and appears to have little chance of approval. The Administration and bank regulators have proposed a different way to recapitalize the fund. **********They have recommended repairing the fund by increasing its authority to borrow by $70 billion. On Thursday, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced a measure to increase the fund's borrowing authority by just $25 billion, but Treasury officials have criticized that measure because it does not include most of the proposals they have put forward to overhaul the entire banking system.  On Top of Current Premiums **********Mr. Bowsher's suggestion that the fund be buttressed by an immediate special assessment was immediately challenged by banking groups, who said a bite of 40 cents for every $100 in deposits would be too much for the industry to bear. The assessment would be on top of existing premiums, which are scheduled to increase this summer to 23 cents for each $100, from 19.5 cents. **********The $15 billion sought by Mr. Bowsher to bolster the fund is slightly less than the entire industry's earnings last year. It also represents less than one-tenth of American banks' existing capital -- the owners' stake in the banks that is crucial as a cushion to absorb large losses. **********Mr. Bowsher said preliminary results of the audit of the bank fund put its net worth at the end of last year at $2 billion to $5 billion. The actual amount depends upon how dozens of large banks that are effectively insolvent, but have not yet been seized by the Government, are classified. **********Unaudited results put the fund's net worth at $8.4 billion as of Dec. 31. L. William Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., disclosed on Tuesday that his agency was disputing the G.A.O.'s audit, but the accounting office declined to comment before presenting its conclusions to lawmakers today. **********Mr. Seidman has said the fund is weak and needs additional borrowing authority. But he has said it would not be insolvent if, as many economists and Government officials have predicted, the economy began to turn around by summer. **********Both Mr. Seidman and Mr. Bowsher acknowledge that a large part of their dispute centers on timing -- whether to recognize losses in 1990 or 1991 for a fund that virtually all officials now concede is headed toward insolvency if Congress and the Administration are unable to agree on a solution. **********The findings of the audit have a far-reaching effect, though, because the F.D.I.C.'s authority to borrow from the Government is largely tied to its net worth. This week, officials said they had begun to draw on their borrowing authority to help finance the failure of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks, whose cost had already been subtracted by the F.D.I.C. in its calculation of the bank fund's net worth of $8.4 billion. That collapse requires an initial outlay of at least $5 billion. It is estimated that the failure will cost as much as $2.5 billion ultimately, after the banks' bad assets are sold. **********Mr. Bowsher and Mr. Seidman have said they hope to work out their differences soon. But if they are unable to reconcile the different financial figures, Mr. Bowsher said the accounting office would have to give a qualified, or adverse, auditor's opinion that the F.D.I.C. balance sheets are not based on generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require that all contingent liabilities be included in the audit. **********Bank deposits of up to $100,000 are protected by the F.D.I.C., and depositors holding up to that amount would continue to be protected even if the fund became insolvent. If that occurred, the fund, which was created in 1934 after many banks collapsed in the Great Depression, would have to be bailed out by taxpayer funds, since it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. **********Mr. Bowsher told reporters after the hearing that the existing difficulties could put the bank fund in the same position as the now-depleted fund that protected depositors at savings associations. **********\"It's somewhat similar to the savings and loan situation of 1988,\" Mr. Bowsher said. \"You don't have money to resolve problems now, so you start parking your problems and then it costs even more.\"  Examination of 368 Banks **********Mr. Bowsher said the G.A.O. figures reflected an examination of the financial condition of 368 banks. Those banks were on the regulators' list of troubled institutions. Many had assets of more than $100 million. **********He said that 71 of those institutions were \"already insolvent, or nearly so\" and would cost the fund $7 billion to $11 billion. Of those banks, he said the problems of at least 40 were so grave that they had to be calculated in the net worth of the fund at the end of last year. **********\"The remaining 31 banks, more likely than not, will fail without recapitalization, but do not meet the criteria of insolvency and therefore present accounting rules do not require the fund to reserve for these banks,\" he said.  Banks See 'Alarming Proposal' **********Banking groups and some Senators on the banking committee criticized Mr. Bowsher's idea of a special premium, saying it could further tighten credit at a time when there were already complaints that banks had refused loans to credit-worthy customers. **********\"It is an alarming proposal that would strike extremely hard at many institutions,\" said Charlotte LeGates of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a Washington-based trade group of banks and savings associations. \"To lead the American public to the idea that bankers can go into the vault, spin the dial and pull out vast hoards of cash is something that is simply not true.\" **********Richard A. Kirk, the president of the American Bankers Association, said the G.A.O.'s proposal \"clearly would be economically and financially counterproductive.\" **********\"If you really want to see a credit crunch, this is the way to get one,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/world/congress-landmark-party-in-decline.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Kaufman", "pub_date": "1991-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 943, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Congress: Landmark Party in Decline", "print_headline": "Congress: Landmark Party in Decline", "body_text": " **********When the politicians of the Congress Party moved yesterday to ask Sonia Gandhi to succeed her slain husband as party leader, it was hardly the first time that they were seeking to exploit family connections to link today's party to the one that led India to independence and then shaped the country's institutions and agenda. **********This time, the move seemed desperate, since the widow of Rajiv Gandhi is an Italian-born woman who has stayed away from politics and who was not even an Indian citizen until eight years ago. **********Still, the attempt by the party leadership to evoke an image of continuity with a glorious past, through ties of blood and marriage, is understandable. The original Congress Party was one of the great political organizations of the world, a disciplined force that reached into the most remote villages to determine the nation's destiny and set its priorities. **********But there are many in India and abroad, both scholars and politicians, who dispute the present party's claims of direct descent from that old Congress. They say that the party led by Jawaharlal Nehru was very different from the Congress Party led by his daughter, Indira Gandhi, and the one directed by her son Rajiv.  Will She Accept Offer? **********Moreover, they say that whether or not Sonia Gandhi accepts the party leadership, they cannot envision the Congress Party ever regaining the dominance it had when it was the major vehicle, first for independence and then for nation-building. **********\"That old Congress Party essentially came to an end in the late 1960's, when Indira Gandhi put an end to it,\" said Atul Kohli, a Princeton University professor, whose book, \"Democracy and Discontent: India's Growing Crisis of Governability,\" was published last month. **********Mr. Kohli said that the old party had been forged by a single nationalistic agenda. Its leaders rose through the ranks, often going to prison in the colonial period, and developing discipline and cohesion in the process. But in the second decade after the independence of 1947, that single national agenda was no longer quite so compelling. **********Philip Oldenberg, an India scholar at Columbia University, dates the change in the party to 1969, when Mrs. Gandhi removed the old party bosses known as \"The Syndicate.\"  Rearrangement of Power **********\"She changed the party from a bottom-up party to a top-down organization,\" he said. Under the old system, Congress Party bosses spent years developing political power in their regions. Fortified by the votes they could amass and the patronage they could dispense in their regions, they would stake their claims and bargain with the party's national leaders. **********Mr. Kohli said that when Mrs. Gandhi purged the old regional leaders, she was aware that as the country matured, there were likely to be more and more challenges from below. \"She realized that if the party was to survive, it had to go through a metamorphosis, and what she came up with was something akin to a mass movement.\" **********Rather than commanding a network of bosses, each with his own base, she sought to amass power from contact with the people and dispensed positions solely for personal loyalty. **********\"The power of the new Congress types flowed from the closeness to the top,\" said Mr. Kohli, who noted that this form of leadership continued when Rajiv Gandhi took over the party in 1984 after his mother was killed. Different Style of Leadership **********One sign of the party's growing rigidity has been the failure of its recent leaders to permit full and open elections for leadership positions. These had been conducted regularly since the party was first formed under British rule, but no such ballot has been held since 1972.. **********Even as the Congress Party changed its style of leadership, it clung to the slogans of secularism, tolerance and nonalignment in foreign affairs that had been established in the Nehru years. This, however, did not distinguish it from many other parties that had adopted these values as their own. **********David Lelyveld, a dean at Columbia who has studied and written about India, noted that the range of Indian politics is populated by people who have fled from the Congress Party and now lead other groups. \"On most points of ideology, I cannot tell the difference,\" he said. \"All of them are for an independent foreign policy; all of them are for secularism.\" **********Mr. Lelyveld said he thought it would be wonderful if there were to be a laerge-scale return of those who had jumped or been pushed from the Congress Party during the time it was led by Mrs. Gandhi or her son. This might lead to a revitalization of a centrist political force that could counter growing divisiveness in religion and caste. But he added, \"I really can't see this happening because of personal ambitions and the resentments that have developed over the years.\" 'Organizational Vacuum' **********Mr. Kohli said that over the long run, the decline of the Congress Party is likely to continue, though the party might do well in the second and third rounds of elections next month with the help of a strong sympathy vote. **********\"The organizational vacuum will continue,\" he said. **********Mr Kohli, who argues in his book that all of India's parties are weak and weakening, said he believes that the Congress Party will never regain its once-dominant position. It no longer establishes the political agenda, he said, and is \"caught in the middle\" between those parties seeking constituencies on the basis of religion and those appealing to voters on the basis of caste coalitions. **********\"It may benefit through its centrist appeal,\" he said, \"but it is also likely to be found wanting with no great ideas to offer.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/12/business/company-news-pennzoil-move-on-exploration.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pennzoil Move On Exploration", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pennzoil Move On Exploration", "body_text": " **********The Pennzoil Company said it would shift the focus of its oil and gas exploration to outside the United States.

Most I.B.M. watchers were predicting that first-quarter earnings would be flat. **********The stock, which had risen to $127.875 before the company's warning on earnings, tumbled $12.75 that day. Yesterday, it fell $2.125 a share to close at $108.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was second on the most active list.  In Line With Prediction **********The earnings results announced yesterday were generally in line with what the International Business Machines Corporation had predicted last month. But the company's poor performance raised questions for a number of financial analysts who suggested that the giant computer maker had erred in minimizing the difficulty surrounding its current shift to a new generation of mainframe computers. **********For the first quarter of 1991, revenue amounted to $13.5 billion, down 4.5 percent from the previous year's $14.2 billion. Net earnings from operations for the three months amounted to $532 million in 1991, compared with $1.04 billion in 1990, or 93 cents a share, compared with $1.81 in 1990. **********I.B.M. actually reported a net loss of $1.73 billion for the quarter, but that largely reflected a one-time accounting adjustment of $2.26 billion, or $3.96 a share, to take account of what the company expects it will eventually pay out in health benefits for retirees.  Part of Personnel Costs **********The theory is that the eventual retirement health benefits of today's employees are part of a company's personnel costs and they should be charged against current profits even though the actual outlays are many years down the road. I.B.M. is one of the first of the nation's leading corporations to comply with the new accounting rule. **********The company said it had double-digit revenue declines in a number of its product lines, including both mainframe and personal computers. The company's rapidly growing RS/6000 work station line, introduced last April, was the one positive factor in the hardware sales. But an I.B.M. spokesman said sales of those models had also been disappointing during the first quarter. **********\"It looks like it could get worse before it gets better,\" said Steven Smith, a financial analyst at Paine Webber. **********Sales of computer hardware declined 17.2 percent worldwide in the quarter over the corresponding three months last year. In Europe, sales of computers were still slightly positive for the quarter, analysts said. But after subtracting for the effect of the dollar, sales also declined there. **********\"There was one aspect that was truly stunning,\" said Marc G. Schulman, an analyst at UBS Securities. \"I.B.M. indicated that its PC revenues declined as much as its overall equipment revenues. I have to conclude that there is a slowing of the PC market worldwide.\" **********Both software sales and support services, however, increased substantially in the quarter. Revenue from services grew 18.9 percent, while software sales rose 13.9 percent. Confidence Shaken **********The unusual weakness of I.B.M.'s first quarter seemed to shake the confidence of a number of analysts who said they were considering further rollbacks in their annual earnings estimates, lowering their forecasts significantly below last year's $10.51 a share. **********The company gave no indication that it expected any significant financial improvement until the international economy improved. In a statement, I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, said, \"The worldwide economic slowdown has created an uncertain and difficult business environment.\" He added that he believed the strength of I.B.M.'s product line would permit the company to revive quickly once the economy improved. **********I.B.M. said in March that it planned to reduce worldwide employment by 14,000, or 3.8 percent, this year, but the company said yesterday that the employee cuts would not have a financial effect on the first quarter or the rest of the year. No Layoffs Planned **********I.B.M. shed 4,000 employees after the sale of the company's office equipment division last month. An additional 10,000 employees will be reduced through attrition. No layoffs are planned but I.B.M. will try to persuade employees to leave by offering early retirement and voluntary resignation incentives. **********Several analysts said they believed that while the company has been attributing its earnings decline exclusively to the world economic climate, its product offerings may be causing it more difficulty than it is willing to acknowledge. **********\"They continue to blame the entire shortfall on the worldwide economy and I think that's hurting their position,\" said John B. Jones, Jr., an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. \"The survey data we have show that mainframe sales have fallen off dramatically.\" Earnings from mainframes make up more than half of I.B.M.'s total profits. **********Mr. Jones suggested that a significant revenue decline was attributable to the delay in introduction of the most powerful members of I.B.M.'s new System/390 mainframe family. While it is now shipping air-cooled versions of the new computers, the most powerful high-speed water-cooled machines will not be available for sale until the third quarter, pushing significant revenues toward the end of the year. **********An I.B.M. official disputed the suggestion that the company might be suffering the effects of a product introduction delay. He restated that the company believed its revenues were being depressed by a worldwide economic recession. **********\"I.B.M.'s plan for the first half of the year says flat to down,\" said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. \"That sounds like transition to me.\" **********In the market for personal computers, which is a small but growing part of I.B.M.'s business, representing less than a fifth of its sales, Mr. Martin said that the industry had been seeing rather weak growth for the last three or four quarters and that that trend had now been compounded because the average selling price peaked last year and had now started to decline. **********I.B.M. is particularly vulnerable to large-scale trends because it is the only personal computer maker that has products at every level, from cheap home personal computers to some of the largest and fastest machines that act as storage systems in office networks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/06/world/shells-still-fall-on-croatian-towns-despite-truce.html": {"writer_name": "Chuck Sudetic", "pub_date": "1991-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 627, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shells Still Fall on Croatian Towns Despite Truce", "print_headline": "Shells Still Fall on Croatian Towns Despite Truce", "body_text": " **********The thunder of exploding Yugoslav Army shells and and air-launched rockets continued to roar around the Croatian port city of Dubrovnik and dozens of other Adriatic coastal towns today, hours after the presidents of the warring Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Serbia agreed to a cease-fire. **********Pro-Serbian Yugoslav Army units also carried out many artillery and air attacks today against inland regions of Croatia and staged a new offensive against the town of Karlovac, threatening to block the last main highway linking the breakway republic's capital, Zagreb, with the coast. **********Fires, whipped up by fierce sea winds, are burning out of control across acres of brushland near Dubrovnik, the renowned resort that has been cut off for five days.

The sharpness and openness of the criticism was a departure from the Ambassador's usual background briefings for the press, and appeared to signal his readiness to challenge the revival of anti-American reporting on the evening news show. **********Mr. Matlock's specific target was a report on Vremya last Saturday in which the newsreader, Dmitri Biryukov, accused the A.F.L.-C.I.O. of interfering in internal Soviet affairs by declaring solidarity with striking Soviet coal miners, giving them financial assistance and inviting them to the United States. **********Mr. Matlock opened the briefing by playing a tape of the program. According the Interfax account, which was confirmed by the Embassy spokesman, the Ambassador said he was \"staggered\" by the presentation. **********He asked, \"Is there not the slogan, 'Workers of the World, Unite' on Pravda's front page? Or does this slogan not imply help? Or perhaps Vremya commentators simply do not read Pravda?\" **********Mr. Matlock said that American miners and trade unions did have contacts with their Soviet colleagues, and that representatives of independent Soviet miners' unions had been invited to the United States under the International Visitor Program, along with Soviet writers, actors, medical workers and staffers of the state television and radio company. **********Mr. Biryukov also alleged that American diplomats were attending rallies of striking miners with unfriendly intentions. The Ambassador declared that there was nothing untoward in these actions: \"We seek to understand what is taking place in the country and what processes are under way. We do everything openly.\" New Television Director **********The Ambassador charged that over the past two months Vremya had resumed a xenophobic stance. He said that under Leonid P. Kravchenko, the new director of state television appointed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last November, Vremya had passed beyind editorial commentary to expressing the opinions of specific state structures. **********The transformation of state television under Mr. Kravchenko, and especially the undisguised use of Vremya as a vehicle for the Kremlin, have been one of the most visible aspects of Mr. Gorbachev's new politics, and a major target of the liberal opposition. **********Before Mr. Gorbachev introduced his \"new thinking\" in foreign policy five years ago, it was a mainstay of Soviet propaganda to imply that foreign plotters and secret services were always seeking to do harm to the Soviet Union. The insinuations served both to perpetuate a suspicion of foreigners in the population, and to create scapegoats for Moscow's own problems. **********Mr. Gorbachev's shift from liberal advisers to an alliance with conservative forces in recent months has included a revival of the practice. The President himself on a recent visit to Byelorussia insinuated that there was something suspicious in the fact that \"democrats\" were frequently invited to travel abroad, although he frequently travels in foreign countries himself. **********According to the report, the Ambassador also said that American economists doubted that the economic changes such as price increases now being put in practice by the Kremlin could have positive results. \"We would like to maintain mutually beneficial economic relations with the Soviet Union, but we just do not know of any way to maintain them with the command and administrative system,\" Mr. Matlock was quoted as saying. **********But the Ambassador was also quoted as saying that American-Soviet relations were developing in the right direction, and that there could be no return to the cold war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/business/business-digest-241591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY **********The F.T.C. filed complaints against three companies that entice children to run up large phone bills calling \"900\" numbers.

Rockefeller organized the company in 1882. **********Like other international oil giants, most of Exxon's gains came in foreign refining and marketing, where profits were almost five times higher and provided half of the company's total earnings, at $1.1 billion, from $219 million in the first quarter last year. Combination of Factors **********The increase included a one-time gain of $160 million from sales of an Australian refinery to the Mobil Corporation and of a large tanker to a Greek shipping concern. **********The combination of huge demand for jet fuel, kerosene and other refined products by the allied forces in Saudi Arabia, cold weather in Europe and rising government-controlled prices for gasoline and natural gas in Europe and Asia created a rare bonanza for refiners. **********When crude oil costs plummeted after allied air attacks began on Jan. 17, profit margins on refined products like jet fuel and diesel soared to an average of more than $7 a barrel in the quarter in Europe and Singapore, from a more typical level of about $2.50. **********Profitability has since retreated to about $3.80 a barrel in Europe, and 98 cents in Singapore markets, but Exxon still appears likely to register the most profitable year in its history, said Frederick P. Leuffer, senior oil analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. He said Exxon should earn $6 billion this year, more than the $5.53 billion it earned in 1984, its most profitable year to date.  Net Off at Sun **********\"The higher earnings for the year will simply be a function of the first quarter and nothing beyond that,\" said Frank P. Kneuttel, an oil analyst at Prudential Securities. The factors creating the huge profit were \"unique and unlikely to be replicated,\" he added. **********In a separate report, the Sun Company, the nation's largest independent refiner, said its net income fell 42 percent. Excluding a one-time gain caused by an accounting change last year, operating income was unchanged. **********Following are the details of the companies' results: Exxon **********Earnings were equal to $1.78 a share in the quarter, compared with $1.28 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the first quarter of 1990. Sales for the Dallas-based company rose nearly 15 percent, to $30.69 billion, from $26.71 billion. **********While not referring directly to the Persian Gulf war, Exxon's chairman, Lawrence G. Rawl, said \"unusually favorable market conditions\" in the foreign refining business generated much of the company's profit in the quarter. **********Refining profits were also strong in the United States, rebounding to $256 million, from a $28 million loss in the quarter a year ago, when repairs limited production at some refineries. **********Profits from foreign oil and gas production fell slightly, to $721 million from $730 million, but plunged in the United States, to $150 million from $355 million, partly because of a $75 million write-down for oil reserves Exxon plans to sell. **********Another factor was a drop in the average price paid for its Alaskan crude oil, which was $14.67 a barrel in the quarter, compared with $16.61 in the quarter last year. Natural gas prices were also lower in the United States, falling to an average of $1.87 per 1,000 cubic feet in the quarter, from an average of $2.05 a year ago. **********Higher demand and prices for basic petrochemicals, like polyethylene, and falling prices for crude oil and other raw materials helped profits in chemical manufacturing rise to $223 million, from $181 million. **********The company allocated $2.5 billion in 1989 for costs to clean shorelines, restore wildlife habitats and reclaim other areas fouled in the Exxon Valdez oil spill of March 1989. No provisions related to the Alaskan cleanup were included in the first-quarter results. **********However, Judge H. Russel Holland, a Federal district judge in Alaska today rejected Exxon's plea-bargaining settlement with the Government in which the company agreed to pay $100 million to settle criminal violations concerning the oil spill. **********Exxon's shares were unchanged today, at $60.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sun **********Net income was $41 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $71 million, or 66 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Sales fell 1.9 percent, to $3.05 billion from $3.11 billion. **********Earnings from operations over all were unchanged, said Robert McClements Jr., chairman of the company, based in Radnor, Pa. The 1990 results included a $30 million gain from an accounting change. **********Profits in refining and marketing in the United States rose to $38 million, from $25 million, mainly because of higher profit margins. Refinery operating levels fell to 78 percent, from 97 percent, because of shutdowns for repairs and improvements. **********Sun's shares fell $1.25 today, to $33.25, on the Big Board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/09/business/filling-plate-takes-priority-over-curbing-the-appetite.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1991-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Filling Plate Takes Priority Over Curbing the Appetite", "print_headline": "Filling Plate Takes Priority Over Curbing the Appetite", "body_text": " **********The problem with a nation whose oil production satisfies barely half its oil appetite is not its appetite, the Bush administration has apparently concluded, but its production. **********With most eyes now focused on the war in the oilfields of the Middle East, many elected officials and private analysts are calling for cutting imports. That was a goal, Secretary of State James Baker 3d said in a speech earlier this week. **********But the oil segment of the draft of the National Energy Strategy is aimed mainly at supplying the American appetite, rather than curbing it. This is in sharp contrast to the energy policies generated by the oil crises of 1973-74 and 1979. Those earlier policies assumed that the cause of the imbalance lay at least in part on the consumption side. Other Sources of Energy **********Imported oil amounts to nearly half the oil used in this country but only 10 percent of total energy consumption, which includes natural gas, nuclear power, coal and hydroelectric power. The United States also imports natural gas and other fuels but exports coal. The net result is that the nation produces about 82 percent of all the energy it uses. **********Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling is the oil companies' biggest hope for expanding reserves, and thus production. But in the view of industry and others, this is not salvation. The Department of Energy said last fall that the median estimate of its size was 3.2 billion barrels, which is huge by the standards of what is found in the United States these days, but small relative to consumption. And there is always the possibility that it will come up dry. **********\"This will not prevent an increase in the level and share of imports,\" said John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York. \"Increase is inevitable,\" he said. \"The rate might be slightly slower than if the Government had not come up with anything.\"  Competitive Problems **********Brooks B. Yeager, a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, contends that policies aimed at production cannot make much difference in the level of imports. A bigger factor in production, he said, is prices. \"Our ability to pump oil out and market oil is always dependent on whether it is competitive with Middle East oil,\" he said. Because of geology, it simply is not, he said. But measures that would make domestic drilling competitive, like import fees, have generally been ruled out by the Bush Administration, which says they would interfere with a free market. **********Other facets of the policy statement will not cut oil consumption significantly either. **********Nuclear power, for example, the other main focus of the energy package, does not usually substitute for oil; it mostly replaces coal and natural gas. **********And efforts to encourage greater production of other energy sources -- mostly through a return to market principles -- will also have a relatively minor impact on oil consumption and imports.  Fewer Approvals to Get **********Builders of oil and gas pipelines would be relieved of having to obtain an entire category of cumbersome approvals. Nuclear power plant builders would no longer have potentially contentious and delaying hearings at the end of construction. And nearly anybody and his brother could enter the wholesale electricity market as producers. **********The treatment of consumption by the energy policy plan stands in sharp contrast. Gone is all mention of gasoline taxes, taxes on all fuels based on energy content or on carbon production, or new taxes on cars based on their fuel economy. **********Taxing cars based on fuel economy is one idea that is certain to be revived in Congress this year. Cars are widely veiwed as the biggest single target for greater efficiency, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, imposed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, include one of the two major elements of energy policy surviving from that era. The other is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is barely mentioned in the draft, with a call for stockpiling oil products, as well as crude oil.   Not Much Spending Required **********The Department of Energy had considered a variety of methods for stimulating oil production, mostly centering on tax breaks. Some of those would have cost the Treasury $16 or more for every barrel produced. Very few of the proposals that survived to the draft plan stage would require Washington to spend money. **********Mr. Bush's approach also differs from his predecessors' in largely avoiding reliance on new technology, although it would encourage some fleet vehicles to run on alternative fuels, which have not been demonstrated on a large scale, with some reduction in gasoline demand. It would also provide some money for research.  Ideas Around for Years **********Those ideas have been around for years. But it was clear early in the process of developing the strategy that in a political sense, the options were limited. Energy is so basic to so much of the economy that any change represents the swing of an elbow that hits someone in the eye. **********The oil exploration industry got what it wanted most; the refining industry did not get a huge new requirement for alternative fuels, although it may have a new market to meet if fleets turn to other fuels. The auto industry avoided the mileage standards it did not want. The electric utility industry got a change that will please most of its members. **********And the strategy seems mindful of the war in one particular way. By not moving to curb consumption or imports, the Saudis, the Venezuelans and other oil exporters with whom this country has cultivated a good relationship were spared the shrinkage of a big market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/world/200-ethiopians-trapped-in-west-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1991-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1093, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "200 Ethiopians Trapped in West Bank", "print_headline": "200 Ethiopians Trapped in West Bank", "body_text": " **********While Israel has promised not to settle any of its new Ethiopian immigrants in the occupied territories, nearly 200 Ethiopians from the last airlift, in 1984, say they have been trapped against their will for seven years here in the West Bank's most militant Jewish settlement. **********As soon as the 14,100 new immigrants stepped off the planes late last month, Simcha Dinitz, the nation's most senior immigration official, said all of them \"are going to be housed in our 100 absorption centers, and none of them are in the territories.\" **********Mr. Dinitz's promise seemed to satisfy the United States and other governments that had expressed concern. But here in the West Bank's oldest settlement, in the heart of Hebron, Erez Mekerit, a 22-year-old soldier, and his friends are asking: What about us? **********Mr. Mekerit was a part of Operation Moses, the secret airlift in 1984 that brought 10,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel. A few months after they arrived, before any of them had got their bearings, \"they brought us out here,\" said Avraham Kasu, 20, another soldier. 'Won't Let Us' Leave **********\"And for seven years we've been requesting to leave,\" Mr. Mekerit said. \"But they won't let us. We don't have any options.\" **********His friend Rutti Kasa, 18, a high school student, nodded at that and said: \"Everybody here wants to leave. Lots of people are afraid. There's no place to work out here. Our relatives are afraid to visit us. We've been crying and complaining the whole time we've been here. But they won't let us go.\" **********With hardly an exception, nearly all of their Ethiopian neighbors agree. **********It is not that these people are prisoners of the West Bank. In theory every one of them could pack up and leave Qiryat Arba tomorrow. Some of them have. **********But the Ethiopians cannot move without significant Government assistance, and that has not been forthcoming. Spreading Them Across Country **********In 1984, as now, the Ethiopian immigrants arrived in Israel with few possessions, no money, little education and not much idea of how or where they should live in Israel. For the first year, the Government made almost all of their decisions for them -- fed them, clothed them, found them jobs and assigned them places to live. **********Late in 1984, after the immigrants had been in the country for about six months, the Government moved them out of absorption centers and into permanent homes they had been assigned. The policy then, as now, was to spread them all over the country. As Gad Ben Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency, puts it now, \"there was much less sensitivity about these things then.\" **********So about 60 families, more than 300 people, were assigned homes in Qiryat Arba. **********The mayors of some small towns in Israel were complaining that they had too few apartments for their own residents' children. But Qiryat Arba welcomed the Ethiopians with open arms; like all settlements, it was always eager to expand, **********\"Other places don't want them,\" the settlement's leader, Elyakim Haetzni, said at the time. \"We'll take all they can send.\" U.S. Protested in 1985 **********When the United States learned of that early in 1985, the Reagan Administration delivered an official protest to Israel. But Yaacov Tzur, the Absorption Minister then, assured Washington that Qiryat Arba would not be the immigrants' final home. Soon the matter was forgotten. And now, six years later, the Ethiopians say they have been forgotten, too. **********Most of these people are not ideological; few of them seem to care much about the debate over the West Bank. They want only to be near places of employment, close to their families. One after another of them complained that their parents, brothers, sisters and others would not even visit them here. **********\"They think it's like Lebanon out here,\" Mr. Kasu said. **********Time and time again they have put in requests to move. But many are unemployed, for there is little work in the West Bank. And for most of those who do have jobs, the work is menial. **********\"I don't have any work; I can't find any work out here,\" said Eli Noga, who is 34. \"It's pretty here; the people are nice. But like everyone else, I've asked to leave. I want to live with other Ethiopians.\" Needs Government Subsidy **********But Mr. Noga, like the others, lives in a Government-subsidized apartments. He would need another wherever he lived. **********\"I remember that many of them didn't want to be there even in 1984,\" Mr. Ben Ari said. But then, he added, the division of the Jewish agency involved in settling immigrants was controlled by a Likud Party official, a strong advocate of West Bank settlement. There was also a Likud Government of the time. **********With Mr. Dinitz at the head, the Jewish Agency is under Labor Party control today. But now, with all the new Soviet immigrants, there is a drastic housing shortage nationwide. **********The Jewish Agency is a quasi-governmental organization. But the Government would have the largest role in trying to resettle Qiryat Arba's Ethiopians. Still, the right-wing administration of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, struggling to catch up with the drastic housing shortages while also eager to see the West Bank's population grow, has shown no inclination to help them. Priority to the Homeless **********\"We know they are unhappy,\" Mr. Ben Ari said. \"But they already live in their housing solutions. For new homes, we need to give priority to those people who are still in absorption centers and don't have any permanent homes at all.\" **********So the Ethiopians say they are trapped. **********\"Maybe they aren't trying to keep us against our will,\" Miss Kasa said. \"But nobody's giving us any place to go. And you definitely see that they want new immigrants out here.\" **********With that, she gestured behind her to a large shipping crate that had held the belongings of new neighbors, a family that had just arrived in Israel. The stenciled letters on the side of the box were in Russian. Others like it are scattered among several buildings. **********In the last two years, some of the Ethiopian families with independent means have managed to move out of Qiryat Arba on their own. And in almost every case that an apartment is vacated, Miss Kasa says now, \"Russian immigrants are moving in.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/23/business/company-news-intel-adds-cheaper-chip-at-top-of-line.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1991-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 421, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Intel Adds Cheaper Chip At Top of Line", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Intel Adds Cheaper Chip At Top of Line", "body_text": " **********The Intel Corporation today showed the first of a series of chips that it hopes will help it maintain its supremacy in microprocessors, the central control chips inside personal computers. **********The new 486SX is a scaled-down version of Intel's most powerful microprocessor, the 486. At $258, it is less than half the price of the full 486 and roughly equal to the price of the earlier-generation 386. **********Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., had prospered as the only vendor of the 386, which is used in personal computers that conform to the standard initially established by the International Business Machines Corporation. But recently, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., began selling a clone of the 386. Strategic Offering **********By offering a lower-priced 486, however, Intel hopes to get the personal computer industry to migrate toward the more powerful 486, for which Intel remains the only vendor. **********The 486SX is slower than the full 486, which has been renamed the 486DX.

Over the last 18 months, the Government has periodically called on the country -- and especially party officials -- to learn from Mr. Jiao and his selfless enthusiasm for serving the people. **********The film glorifies Mr. Jiao in his period as county party secretary, and fits squarely in the current passion for sentimentality in the arts. The first scene is of people crying, and the tears keep coming throughout the movie.The movie has already sold 520 copies around the country, an all-time record in China, although this may be because local film distributors feel it would be a political mistake not to buy it. Chinese \"work units\" are expected to organize their employees to see special screenings of the film as an alternative to more traditional kinds of \"political study\" sessions, such as reading speeches of national leaders. **********Yet while the movie will probably leave viewers with a highly favorable impression of Mr. Jiao, who is constantly shown spurning privilege and mingling with ordinary citizens, this may not do much to bolster the legitimacy of the present leadership. **********\"The message from the leaders in this type of propaganda is that the people should be more like these role models,\" a Western diplomat said . \"But the message the people may get is: Why can't our leaders today be more like the heroes of the past?\" **********The movie has just opened, so it is too soon to know how the general public will react. But diplomats and Chinese alike say it is possible that viewers may go home wondering: Why was Mr. Jiao so popular, while Prime Minister Li Peng is so unpopular? Why can't we find somebody like Mr. Jiao to be prime minister? **********The Minister of Radio, Film and Television, Ai Zhisheng, seemed inadvertently to underscore the dissatisfaction with today's leaders when he was quoted on the front page of People's Daily a few days ago as saying, \"The people and the times, they require Jiao Yulu.\" **********Perhaps unintentionally, the film has also portrayed Mr. Jiao as something of a rebel against the party establishment. At one point after he violates a regulation, a \"work team\" is sent out to investigate his conduct, just as \"work teams\" were sent to many offices after the 1989 crackdown. Fearful that Mr. Jiao will be dismissed, the local citizens even threaten to march on Beijing, in a scene that tends to legitimize the 1989 demonstrations more than the Government that crushed them. **********Other propaganda films have backfired in the last couple of years. Shortly after the crackdown, for instance, a movie gained renown because of a line in which a pre-Communist government decides not to fire on protesters. The contrast with the killings in 1989 was stark, and invariably audiences broke into applause."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/06/business/salomon-cuts-off-former-managers.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALOMON CUTS OFF FORMER MANAGERS", "print_headline": "SALOMON CUTS OFF FORMER MANAGERS", "body_text": " **********In a stunning break with its past management, Salomon Brothers Inc. announced yesterday that it would pay no compensation, severance or future legal expenses stemming from the Treasury markets scandal to the four senior executives who have resigned, including John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman who built Salomon into a bond-trading giant. **********The decision, reached at an early morning meeting yesterday by the firm's board, would also end compensation and payment of legal expenses to Thomas W. Strauss, the former president; John W. Meriwether, a former vice chairman, and Donald M. Feuerstein, the former general counsel. The men, or lawyers for them, all declined to comment. **********The firm said it would continue to meet any legal obligations to the men that could arise under their employment contracts or other agreements. The firm's new legal counsel will determine over the next few weeks what those obligations are. **********The decision could be a significant tactical move to portray the actions of the senior executives as outside the scope of their employment, said a lawyer who has discussed the case with executives involved in it. **********\"They directors have made the decision that they will argue that these executives were not acting on behalf of the company,\" said the lawyer. \"It means that the directors have decided that the interests of the executives are not congruent with those of the firm.\" **********Salomon's decision, in effect, now isolates the firm's former top managers, as investigations continue into the unfolding illegal bidding scandal in the Treasury markets. **********The board's action is perhaps the most surprising for Mr. Gutfreund, who until last month was one of Wall Street's most powerful executives. Mr. Gutfreund resigned his post days after Salomon disclosed that he and the other three executives had known of illegal bidding by the firm since April, but had failed to inform the Government for four months. **********The decision is likely to prevent the executives from receiving a portion of a three-year, $100 million deferred payment pool that is scheduled to be distributed to the firm's top executives early next year. Mr. Gutfreund is the only executive who is not a member of that pool. **********Robert Baker, a spokesman for the firm, said the conditions on the decision were there only because of legal limitations. \"The board went as far today as they can legally go,\" he said. **********The salaries of at least three of the executives were in the multimillion-dollar range. Last year, according to Government filings by the firm, Mr. Gutfreund was paid $2.264 million, and Mr. Strauss was paid $2.014 million. In 1990, Financial World magazine identified Mr. Meriwether as one of Wall Street's highest paid executives, with an estimated annual compensation of $8 million. Mr. Feuerstein's salary has not been disclosed. **********The board also decided that the men would no longer provided offices or paid for expenses. The executives have continued to work in Salomon's old headquarters building, and the decision indicates that if they do not move, they will have to pay Salomon for their space. **********During testimony before a Congressional subcommittee on Wednesday, Warren E. Buffett, the new chairman of the firm, was told that Salomon should have no further financial dealing with the former executives, a suggestion that appears to have been quickly accepted. **********\"There should not be a dime spent by the firm to defend the wrongdoers\" Representative Jim Slattery, Democrat of Kansas, told Mr. Buffett. \"These men should be in striped suits, sweeping up Wall Street.\" **********Last night, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who conducted the Congressional hearing on Wednesday, applauded the board's decision. \"This kind of misconduct requires strong medicine,\" he said. \"By today's action, Salomon continues to show it is taking its problems -- and the need for strong remedies -- seriously.\"  Buffett's Philosophy **********Thomas A. Russo, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a Wall Street law firm, said, \"This fits with Warren Buffett's general philosophy of taking anyone who has anything to do with the scandal and divorcing them from the new Salomon Brothers.\" **********A partner at the law firm Howard, Darby & Levin, which represents both Mr. Gutfreund and Mr. Strauss, said he had no comment on Salomon's announcement. Mr. Feuerstein said, \"I don't think it's appropriate to comment.\" A spokesman for Mr. Meriwether said his client was unavailable for comment. **********With the interests of the firm and the former management now completely broken, the possibility of Salomon's uncovering more information about the executives' knowledge of the illegal bidding and other actions seems more remote. In a report submitted to Congress on Wednesday, the firm said that it had asked to re-interview Mr. Gutfreund and Mr. Strauss about the case, but that the request had not yet been granted. The report said the two men had indicated that they would continue to cooperate with the firm's investigation. **********Before the firm announced its final break with the former management yesterday, Standard & Poor's lowered Salomon's credit ratings a notch because of the scandal. The ratings went to A from A+ on billions of dollars of senior long-term debt, to A- from A on subordinated debt and to BBB+ from A- on preferred stock. Moody's Investor Service Inc. lowered its rating on some Salomon debt a week ago. Salomon's stock closed yesterday at $24, down $1 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In a statement, Salomon said the move by S.& P. \"will have no significant impact on the firm's overall liquidity, which remains strong.\" But the rating change will increase the cost of borrowings for Salomon when its finances are already under stress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/24/world/after-the-war-in-a-kurdish-city-the-streets-are-still-the-shops-barred.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1991-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 851, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Kurdish City, the Streets Are Still, the Shops Barred", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; In a Kurdish City, the Streets Are Still, the Shops Barred", "body_text": " **********Nearly a month after the Iraqi Army drove Kurdish insurgents from this provincial capital, ending a 17-day rebel occupation, only a trickle of people who fled the fighting are returning home, despite a Government offer of amnesty. **********This became clear today when the Iraqi Government took a party of foreign journalists on a visit here, apparently in the hope of convincing them that conditions are returning to normal in Kurdistan. The region was virtually depopulated last month, when more than a million and half of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds fled as troops loyal to President Saddam Hussein bore down. **********But the visiting reporters could not find a single shop open in this dusty town of 150,000 nestling under a barren mountain range some 30 miles from the Turkish border. Everywhere rusting shop shutters were pulled tight and garbage-strewn streets were virtually deserted, with few cars moving. **********Older people stood in clusters near the town center and a handful of vendors offered a few potatoes, spring onions, tomatoes, dates and a little meat but no eggs or staples of any kind.  Some Refugees Turn Back **********At the girls' school, Falheela Hussein, the headmistress, said that only about 200 of her 500 students were showing up for classes and that these were mostly members of Iraq's Chaldean Christian minority, which is traditionally loyal. Most of the missing girls are Kurds, she said. **********Several students said they and their families fled toward Turkey and Iran when Kurdish rebels first attacked the city, then returned because of the severe conditions they encountered. **********Leila Zaid, a 15-year-old Kurdish girl, said her family fled to Zakho, the city on the Turkish border where United States forces have set up a haven for Kurdish refugees, but they found the cold and shortages of food and shelter unbearable. A Kurdish vegetable store owner, Haj Abu Mohammed, said he had fled and then returned after he heard that the Government was offering a general amnesty. **********The Governor of Dohuk Province, Mohammed Perous Rustam, himself a Kurd, insisted that conditions were returning to normal in the town, although he admitted that 70 percent of the population had left in the last few weeks. He accused the Kurdish rebels of preventing people from returning with threats of violence and demands for money. **********The Governor said several thousand Kurdish guerrillas attacked the town and captured it on March 14, holding it for 17 days until Government forces \"swept them out.\" He reported that about 100 people were killed in the fighting and that the rebels executed some 20 city officials while in control. **********People in the town spoke of harsh living conditions, saying there was little food available and only intermittent supplies of water and electricity. **********If conditions in Dohuk are typical of the rest of Kurdistan, it appears unlikely that the recent exodus of Kurds is going to be quickly reversed. **********Dohuk is the capital of one of three provinces that make up the autonomous region of Kurdistan. Although an integral part of Iraq, the Kurds preserve their own language and customs and enjoy a degree of self-government. The two other Kurdish provinces are Irbil and Sulaimaniya.  Signs of Fierce Fighting **********The drive from the northern city of Mosul to Dohuk, across a high rolling plateau fringed by harsh mountains, disclosed a powerful Iraqi military force in the area and evidence of fierce fighting during the revolt. Clusters of tanks and army encampments were spread along the roadside as well as artillery guns, their barrels pointing up into the mountains. **********In Dohuk itself and its surroundings, the huge portraits of President Hussein that adorn major road junctions and important buildings have all been smashed and defaced by the rebels. **********Many buildings are pitted with bullet holes and the army controls all entry points to the town. There were also signs of fighting in the outskirts of Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city, 30 miles away. Gunfire had damaged buildings and walls and several electricity pylons had been knocked over. **********Nevertheless, with this latest Kurdish uprising now crushed, the Iraqi Government appears anxious to reach a permanent settlement with its Kurdish population. **********The Kurds are a Sunni Muslim, non-Turkic and non-Arab people who speak a language related to Persian. There are about 20 million of them, half in eastern Turkey, the rest in northern Iraq, western Iran and parts of Syria and the Soviet Union. The were denied the autonomy that they were promised in a post-World War I treaty and have waged intermittent guerrilla war for their own nation-state in Iraq, Iran and Turkey since then. **********Last week talks opened in Baghdad between the Government and representatives of Kurdish opposition groups in exile. Arab officials say that the talks are continuing but that neither side has given a progress report. **********Kurdish opposition leaders in London insist that they are not seeking an independent Kurdish state but only greater autonomy within Iraq and the right to return to villages from which the Government removed them some years ago as a security precaution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-dun-bradstreet-unit-looks-for-new-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dun & Bradstreet Unit Looks for New Agency", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Dun & Bradstreet Unit Looks for New Agency", "body_text": " **********A spokeswoman for Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver, New York, said yesterday that the agency had resigned the advertising account for Dun & Bradstreet Software, Framingham, Mass., because of creative differences. **********But Anne Lynn Galloway, the software company's advertising manager, said that it had begun a review of the account and that the agency was not invited to participate.

Mr. Canton, a longtime tennis-playing friend of Peter Guber, the head of Sony Pictures, played an important part in releasing such Warner successes as \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Batman.\" But he was also involved in several critical and financial disasters, including \"Bonfire of the Vanities.\" Said to Be Guber's Doing **********Officials at the studio said that the change-over was Mr. Guber's doing. Film executives here said Mr. Canton owed his accession to one of the most powerful jobs in Hollywood largely to the fact that Mr. Guber feels very comfortable with him. \"The comfort level is very strong,\" said one executive, who refused to be identified. \"He was never too comfortable with Frank, who has a different style and is of a different generation.\" **********Studio officials said Mr. Price, 61 years old, would be paid $15 million to $20 million in a buyout deal and would remain with Columbia Pictures to produce films that do not necessarily have to be made at Columbia. Executives said the buyout amount represented the value of the rest of Mr. Price's five-year contract -- he took over Columbia in March 1990 -- and the value of his profit-sharing arrangement with Sony. **********Executives said the figure also included the estimated worth of scripts, many of them considered to have a potentially high commercial value, owned by Mr. Price's production company. **********As a movie executive at Columbia and elsewhere, Mr. Price, a former television writer, has been responsible for hits like \"Tootsie,\" \"Out of Africa,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Gandhi,\" \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Back to the Future.\" **********This term at the helm of Columbia has been Mr. Price's second. He headed the studio from 1978 to 1983 and then ran Universal Pictures studios for three years. He returned to Columbia last year to replace Dawn Steel. His big recent success was the critically acclaimed film \"Boyz N the Hood.\" Another film on his watch, \"Return to the Blue Lagoon,\" took a financial and critical drubbing. **********Film executives said the size of Mr. Price's buyout and the confusion over his departure in recent weeks were a considerable embarrassment to the Sony Corporation, which has already spent vast sums in Hollywood. **********The Japanese giant bought Columbia for $3.4 billion in 1989. Sony also paid hundreds of millions of dollars to hire away the producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters but later bought Mr. Peters out of his $2.75-million-a-year contract. The company also made a costly multimillion-dollar buyout of Walter Yetnikoff, who had been the head of CBS Records. **********While Sony will not say, it is widely believed that Mr. Peters was paid $15 million to $25 million and that Mr. Yetnikoff walked away with a $20 million severance after receiving about $40 million in the few years Sony had owned CBS Records. **********\"It's absolutely extraordinary the money Sony is tossing around -- and for what?\" said one prominent studio executive. \"You don't get rid of someone like Frank Price, a guy with a track record like his, after 18 months. Frank is a guy who may be slow, but he's smart, he's methodical and he succeeds.\" Sony Chief's View of Studio **********Movie studio chiefs assert Sony is plainly unhappy with the current team's performance at Columbia. But in a recent impromptu conversation with a reporter in Tokyo, Akio Morita, the president of Sony, denied that he was very concerned about the financial drain and a lack of big movie hits. **********\"It's no problem!\" Mr. Morita said. \"You have to remember the lessons we always learned in R.&D., which is that you make an investment and it takes 10 years to get a return on it. So wait 10 years and you will see that we made the right decision.\" **********Asked about the negative newspaper and magazine articles about Sony Entertainment, Mr. Morita replied: \"Look, it wasn't our decision to change the name to Sony Entertainment. That was their decision in Los Angeles. We had nothing to do with it.\" **********And when asked about the executive turnover at Sony Pictures, he said: \"That's always going on in Hollywood. It's no problem.\" **********As head of his own company, Price Entertainment, Mr. Price has 30 to 40 projects and will work out of the Sony Pictures studios in Culver City in Los Angeles, associates said. **********His decision today to send out facsimilies of his biography and plans for the future stunned Sony officials. **********Mr. Price's move was apparently prompted by a report in The Hollywood Reporter today that expressed uncertainty about the number of films he will make with Columbia. Aides said Mr. Price was especially touchy to the commonly expressed criticism that he makes decisions too slowly. **********Aides also said Mr. Price believed that Sony was planning to announce the change-over today, not Thursday, and was planning, essentially, to publicly disclose his own plans and not leave it entirely in the hands of Sony executives. **********Mr. Price is both annoyed and frustrated at the way his ouster has been handled, aides said.

Two weeks ago, word spread throughout Safwan that the refugees at the camp planned to hold a demonstration against Mr. Hussein.

The refugees say they appreciate the food and medical care that they receive from the Army. **********But one thing the Army cannot give them is an answer about their fate.

Yeltsin and his minions were riding high on their victory today, grilling a humbled Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shaping the composition of the next Government, shutting down hostile newspapers and suspending the Russian Communist Party. **********But even as they savored the spoils of a decisive victory over a system that had resisted them so long, it was far from clear that their ascendance would translate into the radical transformation of Soviet society that has been their goal. **********The lesson of anti-Communist revolutions past was that the sweet taste of victory was inevitably followed by the bitter reassertion of hard realities. The fall of the Berlin wall was followed by the bankruptcy of eastern Germany. Czechoslovakia faced dismemberment, Romania remained chaotic. New Dangers **********And this country, whether under the restored Russian tricolor or the hammer and sickle, was still a beggared land with only a marginal experience of democracy, a widely divided populace and an economy in tatters. **********There were new dangers, too: Mr. Gorbachev was still capable of applying brakes to radical reform. A newly ascendant Russian leadership stood to touch off a wave of seperatism. The window of opportunity opened by the failed coup could rapidly close when the hangover sets in. **********Mr. Yeltsin himself was setting questionable precedents by decreeing the closing of newspapers and suspending the Russian Communist Party, and the anti-Communist fervor underscored the weakness of the fledgling democratic institutions. Mr. Yeltsin's following had been united largely in opposition to the Communists, and it could yet splinter under the pressure of hard decisions. **********For now, in the immediate aftermah of the ignominious collapse of the old commissars' coup, there seemed no limit to the possibilities before the victorious collection of reformers, nationalists, intellectuals and democrats ranged behind the burly back of Mr. Yeltsin. Gorbachev Isolated **********The K.G.B. was under siege, the military was docile, the police were under a Yeltsinite, the Communist Party no longer had the wherewithal to resist the long-gathering fury of the nation and President Gorbachev was isolated. **********But even as the victors celebrated, the challenges were evident. **********There was Mr. Gorbachev. Brought before the Russian Parliament in what was meant as a show of gratitude and solidarity for his deliverance by the Russian leaders, he soon came to appear less a president than a co-conspirator in the dock at a political tribunal. **********Though he repeatedly said \"we reformers\" and spoke of the need to maintain unity \"in the ranks of democrats,\" he made clear he was not prepared to cast his lot unequivocally with the radical reformers. **********He talked of continuing with his Government's weak economic program, he maneuvered to keep his own people in Government, he defended the \"peasants, workers and intelligentsia\" of the Communist Party, and he sought to depict the coup as aimed against him personally and not as an onslaught by the system with which he had been allied and organized by those he had appointed. **********Soon heckling spread through the hall, and Mr. Yeltsin, openly asserting his power over an old rival, repeatedly prompted and corrected Mr. Gorbachev, even ordering him in prosecutorial tones to read out notes from a closed meeting of the Council of Ministers at which minister after minister was revealed to have embraced the state of emergency or condoned it. **********The sparring suggested that even if the balance of forces had dramatically tilted toward Mr. Yeltsin, a new relationship had yet to take shape between the old rivals and Mr. Gorbachev was not yet ready to assume a ceremonial role. **********And for all of Mr. Yeltsin's new authority, Mr. Gorbachev still commanded considerable powers as federal President, capable at least of impeding the passage of that with which he disagreed. **********That possibility alarmed advocates of radical reform who believed that the moment had to be seized immediately if it was not to be lost. 'Ready Now to Accept Sacrifice' **********\"People who stood three nights in the rain to protect Yeltsin are ready now to accept sacrifice,\" argued Sergei A. Zverev, a member of the economic research center led by the radical economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky, with whom Mr. Yeltsin had held vigil in the threatened Russian Parliament during the coup. \"But the window will not be open forever.\" **********The heckling of Mr. Gorbachev and the shouts of \"resign, resign\" as he drove away from the parliament testified to the mood of disappointed expectations. **********It began on Wednesday night, when on his return from the Crimea Mr. Gorbachev did not come directly to the Russian Parliament where the resistance to the coup was centered. And it turned more sour over the full day that passed before he came. **********\"If he had come that night, we would have carried him on our shoulders,\" Mr. Zverev said. \"Instead he started saying that he is still a Communist. He missed a great opportunity.\"  'He Is Lucky He Survived' **********Mr. Gorbachev's performance was also seen as a failure to appreciate the real significance of the coup. **********\"What Mikhail Sergeyevich failed to understand is that all his power and the power of the bureaucracy is supported by four whales -- the military industrial complex, the K.G.B., the army and the bureaucracy,\" said Dr. Vyacheslav Fyodorov, a prominent eye surgeon and a Russian deputy. **********\"Until he destroys them, not without our help, his power is ephemeral. Any moment, as soon as he stops serving them, they will wipe him out. He is lucky that he survived. But instead of eliminating the chance of a repetition, he is dreaming of some strange reformation.\" **********Yet if Mr. Gorbachev disappointed the Yeltsinites by affirming old socialist loyalty and clinging to old programs, the newly ascendant forces had yet to shape their own clear agenda. Mr. Yeltsin had adopted for Russia a version of the radical \"500-day\" economic program that Mr. Gorbachev had earlier rejected. But until the new union treaty became binding, he still lacked the levers or powers to put it in effect.  Dangers in the Streets **********The other potential dangers rose from the streets. Though a wave of anti-Communist fervor was inevitable in the heat of the moment, it was only Mr. Gorbachev who cautioned that the passions undermined the political tolerance that the reformers had so ardently demanded. **********Mr. Yeltsin, instead of urging caution, seemed to fan the flames by closing down hostile Communist newspapers and demonstratively signing a decree to suspend the Russian Communist Party while Mr. Gorbachev was still at the podium. **********Beyond that was the repeated claim of victory for the Russian republic. One of the disclosures at the parliament session was that Mr. Gorbachev had agreed that the federal Prime Minister would always be a Russian citizen, and that news, combined with the vast new influence of the Russian Government on the Kremlin, seemed likely to fan secessionist sentiments in the other republics. **********And yet, arrayed against all these challenges was the sense that the people had finally overcome what had been the major obstacles to real freedom and real change. **********For all the dangers and threats inherent in a time of revolutionary change, a nation that was despairing of its ability to finally shake off its 70-year yoke had finally done it, and that at a moment when it desperately required a morale boost. **********\"If we could do this,\" argued an engineer outside the Russian Parliament, \"I think we can do the rest.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/27/business/l-regional-danger-in-the-free-trade-pact-644791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Regional Danger in the Free Trade Pact", "print_headline": "Regional Danger in the Free Trade Pact", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Your articles on the decision to negotiate a free trade agreement in North America -- \"We Will Regret a Rush to Free Trade\" (Forum, Oct. 6) and \"Make the Free-Trade Vision a Reality\" (Forum, June 30) -- fail to look beyond the Western Hemisphere to how to make the global free-and-fair-trade compact attainable and viable.

Repercussions of Coup Attempt **********Aftershocks from the abortive coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leader's subsequent abandonment of the Communist Party rolled across the country today. **********A presidential spokesman announced that Mr. Gorbachev's military adviser, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, had killed himself on Saturday night. No evidence has surfaced implicating Marshal Akhromeyev, the former chief of staff of the armed forces, in the attempted coup, but he was instrumental in promoting the military commanders who participated, and he had publicly belittled the danger of a putsch.

Lukyanov, who has been accused of complicity in the coup, resigned his post, according to Vitaly S. Ignatenko, a spokesman for Mr. Gorbachev who was quoted on a Cable News Network broadcast. ] **********Local governments across the country seized Communist Party buildings following Mr. Gorbachev's decree on Saturday effectively nationalizing the party's wealth. Citizens toppled monuments to Bolshevik heroes, prompting Mr. Yeltsin and other officials to plead for calm. **********\"There should be no euphoria of revenge,\" Mr. Yeltsin told a television interviewer tonight. \"Otherwise we will lose our self-respect as democrats.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev, who appears to have become essentially a junior partner in a coalition government with Mr. Yeltsin, was reported to be at work on a speech for an emergency session of the Soviet Parliament on Monday, which will seek to clarify the murky issue of just who is running the country.  Gains for Yeltsin **********Although the Soviet leader remains Commander in Chief of the armed forces, and is still formally in charge of the central Government, since his return from captivity he has ceded to the Russian president remarkable sway in dictating the shape of a future government. **********On Saturday Mr. Gorbachev named Mr. Yeltsin's prime minister, Ivan S. Silayev, to head a committee charged with drastically reshaping the federal Government and decentralizing economic powers to the republics. **********The four-member committee is dominated by Yeltsin loyalists, who favor slashing central ministries, privatizing state-owned industry and moving rapidly to a free market. **********Mr. Yeltsin said he remains committed to a union treaty that would cede vast powers to the republics.  A Role for Gorbachev? **********The Yeltsin team, which once called for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, now plans to retain Mr. Gorbachev in a scaled-back role, presiding over military and foreign policy and such centralized economic structures as the electric power grid. **********\"Mikhail Sergeyevich has not yet exhausted his potential,\" said Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, in an interview with the independent news agency Interfax. \"I don't think that he needs to resign. We, the Russian government, will help him a great deal.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin said today that he believed the republics should be represented in the National Security Council as a check on the Soviet president's handling of defense policy, and Mr. Khasbulatov suggested that in the new federation, the president would be chosen by the republics rather than in a general election.  A Different Viewpoint **********But aides involved in negotiations between the two leaders say that Mr. Gorbachev has not yet entirely resigned himself to the role of a figurehead. **********In the appointment of a new chief of the security agencies, Mr. Gorbachev successfully insisted on putting his own man in charge of the K.G.B., for example. The parliamentary session gives Mr. Gorbachev a chance -- perhaps his last chance -- to describe how he sees his future role. **********But the redistribution of powers is complicated by the eruption of secessionist sentiment, which is worrisome to both leaders. **********In the Ukraine, the independence declaration calls for the republic to assume control of Soviet military assets on its territory and create its own army. The declaration, which requires popular ratification in a referendum in December, leaves unanswered the question of the nuclear weapons deployed there. **********Mr. Yeltsin faces the additional predicament that the disintegration of the union could spread to his own domain. The Russian federation includes dozens of ethnic homelands, many of them itching for greater sovereignty. Concern Over Ukraine **********A Yeltsin aide said today the Russian president would support the wishes of the Ukrainian people, but expressed concern about the loss of such a key republic. In addition to the question of the military and the Ukraine's importance as a farming and industrial stronghold, the aide said, the loss of its 52 million Slavs would tilt the ethnic balance of the remaining union toward the Muslims of Central Asia. **********That concern grew today with news that the parliament in Byelorussia, the third Slavic republic, had approved an independence declaration. Byelorussia, with a population of 10 million the fifth largest republic, has long been regarded as the most conservative of the republics on the European portion of the Soviet Union, and has seemed relatively immune from the secessionist passions of its Baltic and Ukrainian neighbors. **********The declaration was apparently designed by Byelorussian Communists, who still hold a majority in the parliament, as a way of insulating themselves from Mr. Gorbachev's decree ordering confiscation of party property. A smaller nationalist faction in the parliament also supported the move. Byelorussian Leader Quits **********In another move to protect the party from the wave of anti-Communist sentiment, the hard-line Communist president of the republic, Nikolai Dementei, resigned under pressure. **********The republic of Moldavia announced today that its parliament would vote on secession on Tuesday, a measure that is expected to pass. **********\"Moldavia will no longer be part of an empire which is falling to pieces,\" the speaker of its parliament, Alexandru Mosanu, told Reuters in Kishinev, the capital. \"We shall become independent, and this is part of a chain reaction which no force in the world could stop now.\"  Recognition of Baltic Republics **********The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, whose claim to independence has been endorsed by Mr. Yeltsin but not Mr. Gorbachev, today began to win international recognition. Denmark and Norway announced that they would establish diplomatic relations with the breakaway republics, which were forcibly annexed in 1940. **********Latvia and Estonia voted their independence this week, while Lithuania declared its freedom last year. **********The German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, called on the European Community today to recognize Baltic independence, and there was mounting pressure in the United States for President Bush to do the same. **********Mr. Gorbachev has insisted in the past that secession be carried out according to Soviet law, which requires a referendum and a waiting period of up to five years. He now finds himself under strong pressure from Mr. Yeltsin to acquiesce. Military Commander Ousted **********The Soviet Government today showed signs of relaxing its stance on the Baltics. The commander of military forces in the region, a bitter foe of pro-independence governments, was dismissed for acquiescing in the coup. **********The Latvian president, Anatoly Gorbunovs, met in Moscow today with leaders of the Soviet military, K.G.B. and Interior Ministry and announced afterward that they had agreed to suspend their activies in his republic and open negotiations on \"disarmament.\" **********In the aftermath of Mr. Gorbachev's resignation on Saturday as general secretary of the Communist Party, the party leadership today followed his urging and called for an emergency meeting to disband. **********The party's administrative secretariat issued an appeal to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin to permit a special session of the governing Central Committee where \"the only possible decision\" would be dissolution. **********In announcing his resignation on Saturday, Mr. Gorbachev noted that the party leadership had taken no position condemning the coup, that the main conspirators against him had been members of the Central Committee, and that party newspapers had supported the putsch. **********Their behavior, he said, had exposed millions of rank-and-file Communists to the threat of anti-Communist hysteria. **********The secretariat insisted that the coup plans were kept in secrecy and that party leaders \"tried to do everything to prevent blood from being spilled.\" **********Some republics have suspended or outlawed the party, and party buildings have been sealed pending investigation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/world/100-killed-in-blast-at-ethiopian-depot.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1991-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 575, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "100 Killed in Blast at Ethiopian Depot", "print_headline": "100 Killed in Blast at Ethiopian Depot", "body_text": " **********A huge explosion at a major munitions depot leveled a shantytown here today, leaving scores dead.

Ukraine, which has pledged to create a nuclear-free state, has called for the republics with strategic nuclear weapons to form a collective military command to control and eventually destroy them. **********The Bush Administration's decision to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Kiev this month to discuss Washington's concerns reflects the priority that the United States places on keeping tight control over the Soviet nuclear arsenal as more republics break free. **********The Soviet Union has about 12,000 long-range nuclear weapons in missile silos and submarines and aboard planes as well as 15,000 shorter-range tactical weapons, including artillery shells, gravity bombs and ship-based weapons.  Security of Weapons **********Paramount to American interests, senior Administration officials say, is averting economic and social turmoil that could lead terrorists, thieves or warring armies to seize the weapons now under heavy security. On his trip to Ukraine, Mr. Baker and another American envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas M. T. Niles, will also seek assurances that Kiev intends to honor international arms control agreements signed by Moscow. **********\"The most important thing is for the republics to achieve a peaceful separation,\" a senior Defense Department official said. \"If the situation degenerates into the kind of civil war you have in Yugoslavia, no amount of good will will withstand that kind of battering.\" **********Administration officials said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was a leading advocate of the Administration's decision to move toward recognition of Ukraine's independence, which was opposed by the Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********Since the failed coup in August, Mr. Cheney and senior American military officers have expressed confidence in Soviet control over long-range, or strategic, missiles, and the more mobile tactical, or battlefield, nuclear arms. Confidence in Safeguards **********Elite Russian-dominated military forces guard nuclear weapon depots. Warheads are typically stored miles from their launchers or aircraft and are secured by coded locks. Senior Pentagon officials said this week that American intelligence had detected no significant weakening in these safeguards. **********There are strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Russia, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan and tactical nuclear weapons in all 12 republics, most of which have declared independence in some form. Ukraine has about 15 percent of the Soviet nuclear weapons, including 46 SS-24 long-range missiles that each carry 10 warheads and 130 older SS-19 missiles that have six warheads each, according to Bruce G. Blair, a specialist in Soviet nuclear control procedures at the Brookings Institution. **********Other American experts estimate that Ukraine has 2,500 to 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons, including artillery shells, gravity bombs and ship-based weapons. **********The Administration has taken several steps since the failed coup to encourage a rapid reduction in Soviet nuclear forces. President Bush announced a unilateral initiative in September to dismantle all American tactical nuclear weapons on land and at sea, a decision that prompted a similar order from Mr. Gorbachev for Soviet tactical weapons. **********Soviet and republic leaders have met with senior State Department and Defense Department officials in recent days to discuss the American and Soviet arms proposals and ways to build on them. **********Last week, Congress approved a measure to spend up to $400 million to assist the Soviet Union and the republics in dismantling and destroying their nuclear weapons. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Anatoly Zlenko, told a news conference in Kiev this week that his fledging country was interested in taking up the American offer. **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is the main sponsor of the Soviet aid proposal, along with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, said, \"Right now, there's an eagerness to move to destroy these tactical nuclear weapons in the former republics, but the concern is that eagerness might not last forever.\" Transferring Arms **********Ukrainian leaders have expressed a willingness to transfer tactical and possibly even older-model strategic weapons to the Russia republic, which has the capability to dispose them, American arms control experts said. But Kiev has taken an increasingly firm stance on retaining some control over the more modern SS-24 missiles, prompting some independent analysts to speculate that Ukraine wants to use the weapons as bargaining chips with Moscow and the West. **********\"The United States wants above all to see safe, secure and reliable control over nuclear weapons,\" the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said this week. \"It is for the republics and the central authority to work out the arrangements and exactly how that will be accomplished. We certainly don't want to see a proliferation of centers of control over nuclear weapons.\" **********In Brussels this week, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization urged Ukraine to renounce nuclear weapons, abide by all the Soviet Union's international commitments and define its relations with Moscow and other republics peacefully.  Sharing Control **********Mr. Blair of the Brookings Institution said reports from Kiev indicated that Ukrainian leaders had been meeting quietly with Soviet officials on sharing control over strategic nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. He said these talks would continue through next year on guaranteeing that Moscow would consult Kiev before firing strategic nuclear weapons. In a second phase of the agreement, to be carried out from 1993 to 1995, Moscow would need approval from Ukrainian leaders to launch a missile. **********Scientists at the John F.

Harry Miller walked into the parched scrubland outside this war-weary town.

I told them, 'You're not going to get any money from him even if you kill him.' Finally, I gave them 10,000 rupees and he's back.\" **********For Father Miller, it was a routine day, perhaps a bit better than routine because for the first time in a while he had saved a life. More often in the last year, though, it has been chronicling the deaths and disappearances of thousands of local people that has consumed the New Orleans Jesuit.  The Grim Statistics **********In a corner turret of the high school he once ran, Father Miller records each death, each disappearance, each buried body, each pile of ashes, all the final product, he says, of arrests and roundups of Tamils by the Sri Lankan army and police. He tells the tale of what happened to Kockkadicholai village in July. **********\"There was this army tractor going along hauling some things and the Tigers blew it up and killed the soldiers,\" he said. \"The army came back and massacred the people of this village, 123 dead and 40 in the hospital. They burned 350 kadjan houses, coconut leaf houses. They just shot the people. Fifty-six of the bodies were burned, 67 were buried. It was the army. No doubt about it. **********\"They feel free to burn bodies at the roadside because nobody will testify against them. They feel free to throw boys in wells because nobody will testify against them. They feel free to kick boys in the head because nobody will testify against them. They feel free to dispose of 2,700 citizens of Batticaloa.\" **********Behind his battered wooden desk, Father Miller flips through page after page listing the names of people who are no longer found in Batticaloa, names a small group called the Peace Committee have compiled and sent to the local army and police commanders seeking information. The committee, a group of local people put together by Father Miller, badger the army and police for explanations. Rarely do they get any; more often than not it is subtle threats of violence that filter their way. **********\"Already, two presidents of the Peace Committee have resigned,\" Father Miller said. \"They were afraid for their families.\"  Rebels Rule by Night **********For nearly a decade now, the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan armed forces have battled for control of this eastern part of this island. The Tigers say they fight for the rights of the Tamil ethnic minority, for years discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese; the Sri Lankan forces battle to preserve national unity. **********In daylight hours, the army controls the single 50-mile stretch of road between government-controlled areas to the west and Batticaloa. But when the sun settles into the mountains, the countryside, and the road, return to the Tigers. **********The Tigers tax the local population in gold, as they do elsewhere in the territory they control, And while the practice of requiring families to give up one of their sons to the movement has not become widespread here, there is a mixture of resentment and ambivalence toward the guerrillas among the people of this shrinking town. \"They presume to talk for us,\" Father Miller said, \"but nobody asked us. We didn't chose them. But they have the guns.\" **********When he came here in 1948 as a fresh-faced missionary, Sri Lanka was a drowsy place of farmers and fishermen. \"It was like 1890's America, like the Louisiana my grandfather grew up in.\" recalled Father Miller, who is 65 years old. \"It's changed a bit and changed for the worse. In those days, there was never any violence, except on the football field.\" **********Last year, a fellow Jesuit from Louisiana, Eugene J. Herbert, disappeared while riding his scooter back to Batticaloa from an outlying convent. \"I went to the army and the police,\" said Father Miller, \"and no investigation was ever done.\" **********It was last year, he said, that the killing here reached a crescendo and the work of the Peace Committee began in earnest. \"Last July we started to keep a record of the people taken into custody by the army. As of this month, we have 2,700 disappeared people. Some came back. Most of those who didn't come back are probably dead. In the early days last year, we saw piles of burning bodies. People continue to disappear, up until this week.\" **********So gruesome has the situation become that the local police chief talks of his police camp as Belsen, a reference to the Nazi death camp. **********\"That's where they take young boys to question them,\" Father Miller said. \"They tie them up, drop them in a well. 'Are you a Tiger?' 'No.' Drop them again. 'Are you a Tiger?' 'No.' Eventually they get a confession.\" **********Father Miller shook his head. \"There's no resolution. Neither side has lost. Neither side can win.\" But still, he insisted, he will remain here to document the brutality that has overcome his once peaceful town. **********\"If I find I have no work, I'll go back to Louisiana,\" he said. \"If peace comes, maybe my work will be finished.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/02/business/business-people-chief-leaves-square-d-as-schneider-moves-in.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Rifkin", "pub_date": "1991-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Leaves Square D As Schneider Moves In", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief Leaves Square D As Schneider Moves In", "body_text": " **********No one was surprised when Jerre L.

Support for the Northrop Corporation's B-2 Stealth bomber, already waning, eroded further over the weekend, with even staunch supporters like Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, saying the program should be scaled back. **********Some analysts said Democrats and Republicans alike would find it increasingly difficult to vote for expensive nuclear and nonnuclear weapons systems in the face of pressure on domestic spending programs for education, health care and other issues that the Democrats are likely to raise in next year's Presidential election. The result could well be the cancellation of current programs like the General Dynamics Corporation's Seawolf submarine and the scaling back or slowing down of programs including the Star Wars antimissile shield and the Lockheed Corporation's next-generation Air Force fighter, the F-22. **********\"We're going to start denominating social programs and calculating how many B-2's they represent, and that can't be good for the defense industry,\" said Robert Paulson of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in Los Angeles. \"The pressure will be felt across the industry.\" **********The most immediate losers in the industry are those companies working on nuclear-weapons programs killed by the President in his speech on Friday. They include the Boeing Company, which was working on a short-range attack missile, and the Rockwell International Corporation, which along with a number of other contractors was working on a rail-based version of the MX Peacekeeper missile. **********But those programs are relatively small by industry standards. The real worry for the industry is that Congress will start slashing Pentagon spending for other, bigger programs it feels are no longer justified given the state of the Soviet Union. **********\"There's going to be a lot of rhetoric that doesn't talk to the real issues of force structure, and there are going to be a lot of big-ticket programs with extensive vulnerability\" to Congressional budget cutting, said Bernard Schwartz, chairman of the Loral Corporation, a New York-based supplier of military electronics. **********Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said the President's speech had already increased the chances that the $850 million-a-copy B-2, which accounts for half of Northrop's revenues, will be canceled in negotiations going on now in Congress to reconcile budget bills passed by the House and the Senate. **********Northrop has delivered three of the bat-winged bombers to the Air Force and has 12 more in various stages of production. The Air Force so far has stuck to its request for 75 of the planes, including funds for 4 more next year. But analysts said Northrop would never build the B-2 at the rate of 36 a year that was envisioned under the Air Force's original plan to acquire 132 of the bombers. They said that even if the program is not canceled this year it faced years of limping along with low profits. **********Mr. Adams said he thinks the budget negotiators will also give more consideration to cutting back on the Star Wars program. The antimissile program is spread among dozens of companies, with TRW Inc., Lockheed, Rockwell and others among the largest. **********But the deepest cuts, Mr. Adams and others said, could come if Congress casts aside the budget agreement it made last year with the Administration, under which cuts made in the military, at least through next year's budget cycle, could not be used to finance domestic programs. **********\"We already saw the Democrats after the failed coup in the Soviet Union trying to establish guns versus butter as an issue, and now the budget deal that everyone saw as fixed for 1993 is coming unglued,\" Mr. Adams said. Under those conditions, he said, a number of other big programs could be endangered. **********Analysts said there are a handful of programs that will be particularly vulnerable in any budget debate next year. At the top of the list is the Seawolf submarine, which is being built by General Dynamics at its Electric Boat division in Groton, Conn. The Seawolf is designed to attack Soviet nuclear submarines and has been plagued by cracks in its welds and other technical problems. **********Among the other vulnerable programs are the Air Force's C-17 cargo plane, which is made by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and has just entered its initial flight testing, and the Army's LH combat helicopter, which is being developed by Boeing and the United Technologies Corporation.  Boon for Electronics **********In the long run, budget pressures could make it harder to keep financing programs that the Pentagon has been trying to kill but that Congress has kept alive to maintain jobs in home districts, including the Grumman Corporation's F-14 fighter. **********The one element of the business that continues to have a reasonably bright outlook is military electronics. The armed services are increasingly seeking to upgrade the capability of current weapons systems by cramming sophisticated new electronic components into them. The Pentagon is pushing for more \"smart\" weapons, like missiles that can identify and home in on their targets with little or no direct human aid. And demand within the military is growing for more surveillance satellites and command and control systems. **********\"We think we're still opportunity-rich in terms of the programs we see coming on,\" said Mr. Schwartz of Loral."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/24/business/briefs-364791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 313, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt * Michigan Hospital Finance Authority is offering $52.2 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds initially priced to yield a maximum 7.70 percent for an issue due 2011 through Goldman, Sachs & Co.

The New York agency, whose clients include Sony and Brown & Williamson Tobacco, has begun to tackle the tricky problem of installing new management without alienating clients with close ties to those who had been in charge. **********Nearly nine months ago, Peter Geer, the chairman, brought in John Hayes from Ammirati & Puris to take over management. Mr. Hayes, now president, runs Geer, DuBois in partnership with Rodney Underwood, who joined 18 months ago, also from Ammariti & Puris. Mr. Underwood is vice chairman and executive creative director. **********It is too early to tell if the new managers will succeed, but they got a vote of confidence recently from a couple of clients. On Monday, the Paddington Corporation, a beverage importer, awarded Geer, DuBois about $15 million in new business: the accounts for Baileys Original Irish Cream, Sambuca Romana and Cinzano liqueurs. **********Earlier, Brown & Williamson had given the agency an additional assignment: its Raleigh Extra cigarette account, which is expected to have billings of about $10 million. **********\"Any time there is a change in top management it can be a source of concern,\" said Roger Slone, the senior vice president for marketing at Paddington. \"But this has been managed very well.\" **********Mr. Geer said he had sought new managers because the agency needed an infusion of energy. \"I'd lost the drive to give the agency the cutting edge it needed,\" Mr. Geer said. \"We needed people who would be willing to take chances.\" **********Mr. Geer, who is 61 years old and plans to remain chairman for several more years, joined Geer, DuBois in 1958. The agency was started by his parents (his mother's maiden name was DuBois) largely as a public relations concern. It was Mr. Geer who reshaped the company to specialize in advertising. **********He said he knew the transition to new management would be tricky because clients would likely be nervous about the smallest change. He said the fact that both Mr. Hayes and Mr. Underwood had been brought in from outside the agency was a particular concern. **********The timing of the change was critical. With about $145 million in billings, a healthy infusion of new business would push the agency over the $200 million mark, making it large enough to compete for bigger national accounts. **********At first, the new managers moved cautiously in taking the reins. Most important, clients had to be reassured that while it would not be business as usual at the agency, they had nothing to worry about. \"I've spent a lot of my time talking to clients and gaining their trust,\" Mr. Hayes said. **********\"The work is now very exciting,\" Mr. Geer said. To try to give the agency's ads a fresh look, Mr. Underwood has hired young commercial directors who are more likely to put an unconventional spin on a marketing strategy. **********The team also brought in a new research executive, Martyn Straw, from Ogilvy & Mather. Mr. Straw changed the agency's approach to consumer research, bringing in researchers to work with the creative department from the start of an assignment. More often, a smaller agency's research is used to test the effectiveness of a finished idea. **********The staff seems to be accepting the change. No top executives have left, which Mr. Underwood sees as an encouraging sign. To keep the staff updated on changes and, more important, to get to know them, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Underwood take four employees to breakfast each week. \"It gives them an informal forum to talk to us about problems, concerns or new ideas,\" Mr. Hayes said. **********Joy Sliwa, an executive vice president and director of media services, said she welcomed the changes. \"Before John and Rodney came, I never felt a concerted effort at the agency to grow,\" said Ms. Sliwa, who has worked at Geer, DuBois for 25 years. \"The new leadership is strong and there is more direction now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/28/world/paris-on-no-dollars-a-day-east-europeans-find-a-way.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1991-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1030, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paris on No Dollars a Day?

Just to see Paris, to know that I can come back, is already enough.\" **********In reality, \"seeing Paris\" is about all that an estimated half-million Eastern Europeans -- Poles, Czechoslovaks and Hungarians in the main -- can afford to do here this summer. Even a cup of coffee at a sidewalk cafe seems pricey, given their carefully calculated vacation budgets. **********No one seems to mind. \"We're here to visit, not to shop,\" said Yolanda Grabowska, the interpreter for a group of Polish Catholics who had visited the shrine at Lourdes, in southern France. \"Anyway, we have the same things in Poland and they're cheaper.\"  Versailles, Then Tents **********The trip is possible because most Eastern Europeans come on prepaid bus tours. Many stay in schools, hostels and church halls, and some set up tents or rent mobile homes at a campsite in the Bois de Boulogne, the large and lovely wooded parkland on the city's western edge. Almost all the visitors bring food and drink with them. **********One late afternoon at the Bois de Boulogne campsite, where about a third of the 2,500 campers were from Eastern Europe, Miss Grabowska's group was preparing supper over gas fires. Noodles boiled in one pot, a meat stew from a can cooked in another, and sausages waited on every plate. \"We buy milk and bread locally,\" she said. **********Nearby, a dozen tents set up by a Hungarian tour group were closed and silent. \"They're visiting Versailles today,\" one of the camp organizers said. \"They took packed lunches with them, but they'll be back to cook dinner. They have quite a nice bus. Some of the Hungarians even come by car.\" **********In one mobile home, Michal Matejovic, the driver of a group from Benesov, Czechoslovakia, chewed on a sandwich as he studied a map to prepare the evening tour of Montmartre. \"Before the revolution, some tourists would always stay behind,\" he said. \"But not now. They don't mind going home.\" French Ambivalence **********Nonetheless, the influx of Poles, Czechoslovaks and Hungarians this year has stirred ambivalence in France, where for months newspapers have been carrying reports that millions of people are awaiting the chance to migrate west from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. **********\"The Hungarian tourists who come to France are already employed,\" said Tibor Varkony, a spokesman at the Hungarian Embassy in Paris. \"They are real tourists who have no intention of staying. They have a tight budget, but they come to see the monuments.\" **********France's Ministry of Tourism hopes that while the half-million East Europeans visiting Paris this summer will spend relatively little, they will return with more money in future years. Yet many French tradespeople look at them with disapproval and distrust. **********\"There's discrimination against Poles,\" said Anita Antoniszyn, a 19-year-old student from Poznan. \"We stopped at a town yesterday and I visited a shop. As I was leaving, a saleswoman stopped me and looked through my bag. I was upset and I was angry.\" Poles Look for Work **********Since visa requirements for Poles, Czechoslovaks and Hungarians were lifted, French officials concede that they have become alarmed by the number of Polish tourists who stay on to look for work. Some Poles even apply for political refugee status, though they are routinely turned down. **********\"We are tourist-immigrants,\" a young Pole announced laughingly as he sat with friends, surrounded by rucksacks, on the steps of a Polish-language church here. \"We stay if we can. If not, we go home. But there's no work in Poland.\" He flexed his right arm. \"Look, we're strong. We can work.\" **********Beside the official campsite in the Bois de Boulogne is an improvised camp that has been home to about 80 Poles for the last nine months. \"When we run out of money, we work picking fruit,\" said a young man who sat with others around a table playing cards. **********There were also authentic tourists at this campsite. Three blond young men slept beside a Soviet-made Lada with a DDR sticker announcing that they came from the former East Germany. **********Nearby, there were Swedish and Dutch backpackers who preferred not to pay to put up their tent.  Impressed by the Service **********Michal Vrba, Tomaz Proset and Michal Ohera, three 18-year-old students from Czechoslovakia, said they could spend two weeks in France and the Netherlands for the equivalent of $180 each -- as long as they slept in tents and ate their own food. They allowed themselves a bottle of wine a day. **********\"What has most impressed me is the service here -- you get served so quickly and politely,\" Mr. Proset said. **********\"Politely?\" a surprised resident of Paris asked. \"You must go to Czechoslovakia and you will see the difference,\" Mr. Proset insisted, in fluent English. **********Certainly, many East European tourists here seem too happy to even think of complaining. \"I want to see how young French people live,\" said Magdalena Janowska, a 22-year-old Polish medical student, waving away the fatigue of the 14-hour bus ride from Jelenia Gora. \"Museums are history. People are life. They can teach me more.\" **********But a Polish priest traveling with a Catholic group from Kalisz had made up his mind. \"There are too many ads everywhere, there are too many big buildings, there is too much noise,\" he said. \"It stops people from talking.\" **********He offered his final verdict on France: \"The men spend too much on drink, the women spend too much on clothes.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/02/business/work-wear-defers-interest-payment.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1991-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Work Wear Defers Interest Payment", "print_headline": "Work Wear Defers Interest Payment", "body_text": " **********The Work Wear Corporation has decided to defer today's interest payment on the company's 13 percent senior subordinated notes that are due Jan. 1, 1997. **********The board of the Cleveland maker of industrial work clothing will decide whether the company will make the $6.5 million interest payment before the end of the 30-day grace period, according to a filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The deferral is the result of uncertainties surrounding the company's efforts to reach an understanding with a noteholders' committee concerning the company's long-term objectives, the filing said.

Lowest Since 1987 **********In its report, the association said new orders for machine tools fell to $155.8 million in May from $193.7 million in April. It was the lowest monthly new-order total since August 1987, when it was $142 million. New orders in May were also 24.5 percent below the level of May 1990. For the first five months of this year, machine tool orders are down 13.6 percent from a year earlier. **********Machine tools are used to cut or shape metal parts used in durable products like appliances, automobiles, aircraft and building components. The level of orders and shipments of machine tools is considered an important indicator of the health of American industry. **********\"There seems to be a reluctance on the part of manufacturers to upgrade their facilities,\" said Richard O. Priebe, a spokesman with Cross & Trecker Inc., a large machine tool maker that earlier this month agreed to be acquired by a competitor, Giddings & Lewis Inc. \"Manufacturers seemed to be sitting tight right now,\" Mr. Priebe said. \"It reflects a general weakness in the economy, and that caused manufacturers to delay their purchases.\" **********Larry W. Hollis, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company, a brokerage in Milwaukee, said the May figures reflected weakness in the economy. \"In recessions, orders are generally slow,\" Mr. Hollis said. He added that the May report indicated that foreign machine tool makers, particularly those in Japan, \"continue to make significant inroads in American market share.\" He added that foreign machine tool producers \"now have about half of the domestic market.\"  Link to Factory Use **********Despite the weakness of new orders in recent months, Albert W. Moore, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said he remained encouraged by recent data from the Federal Reserve showing two consecutive months of higher factory utilization. \"Conventional wisdom in our industry is that machine tool orders escalate when capacity utilization crosses the 80 percent level,\" Mr. Moore said. **********\"Manufacturers also have tigher control over their inventories now than in most downturns,\" he added. \"With lean inventories, production will respond quickly to higher demand, in turn creating demand for the machine tool which will be needed to meet new production levels.\" **********Machine tool orders have been hurt by the economic woes of automobile makers, which typically account for more than a third of the industry's new orders. And some analysts suggest that a pickup of new orders from car makers, who are expected to retool soon for new models, will help stimulate new orders for machine tools. Strong Foreign Demand **********The May report also showed that orders from foreign customers dropped a sharp 54 percent from the previous month. Industry executives said that they could not account for that decline, but analysts suggested that it probably resulted from a large level of foreign orders in April. **********Orders from foreign customers, which reached a record last year, were up 10.7 percent for the first five months of the year, while orders from domestic customers fell 18.9 percent in the same period.

The tattered federal Government is virtually the only remaining emblem of Yugoslavia's frayed national unity. A Western diplomat called the development \"the end of normal, civil government.\" **********In Bosnia, the republic south of here that has not previously been embroiled in the conflict, officials said members of Muslim and Croatian communities, who represent nearly two thirds of the 4.1 million population, blocked deployments by federal army troops apparently seeking to cross Bosnian territory to reinforce units in Croatia.  Drawing Bosnia Into Strife **********Tonight, Bosnian leaders said they ordered a mobilization of reserve units throughout the territory. Officials in Bosnia reported standoffs in two places -- Chaplina and Visegrad -- between local militias and federal army units who reportedly advanced firing automatic rifles into the air. **********In three months of fighting between Serbs and Croats, Bosnia has remained aloof despite widely voiced fears that the republic might be drawn into the conflict if its Croats or Muslims tried to prevent federal forces stationed there or groups of Bosnian Serbs from heading for the fighting in Croatia. **********Reports tonight from Bosnia indicated that the federal authorities were seeking to open a new front to relieve federal barracks blockaded by Croatian militias in Croatia and to force Bosnia to take sides. Apart from its territorial importance, Bosnia also hosts one of Yugoslavia's main airforce bases, from which jetfighters can reach Zagreb in less than 15 minutes. **********[ President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia signaled that his republic was on the defensive late Friday when he sent a letter to Mr. Kadijevic offering to lift the blockade of federal army barracks if the army ended its offensive, the Associated Press reported. ] A Military Agenda **********The developments in Bosnia suggested anew that Yugoslavia's predominantly Serbian generals were pursuing an agenda that coincided with the interests of Belgrade's former Communist rulers in extending their writ over areas beyond Serbia where Serbs form significant minorities. **********But military leaders also have a separate interest in securing their own survival in a post-Communist world where eastern Europe's security forces have frequently been discredited. The supposition among some diplomats is that the federal army is pursuing its own aims, beyond the ultimate control of the politicians. **********News of the reported new offensive into Croatia by a Belgrade government openly backing insurgents from Croatia's large Serbian minority of 600,000 brought further woes to this breakaway capital, where air-raid sirens howled three times today -- more out of nervousness over federal air force movements at a big base in neighboring Bosnia than at the prospect of attacks. **********Overnight, two explosions in Zagreb, one at a restaurant, elicited further complaints by Croats that what is termed a Serbian \"fifth column\" is at work in the city to spread instability -- an assertion that has been made about nighttime sniper fire. **********The sirens sent some Zagreb residents scurrying for impromptu bomb shelters in cellars and basement apartments whose sidewalk-level windows were jammed with sandbags.  Army Troops Press Ahead **********But such is the frequency of the alarms that, at the Parliament building, officials abandoned offices on upper floors only to take unscheduled coffee breaks in a ground-floor cafeteria that did a brisk business in espressos, cappuccinos and the slivovitz liquor favored in the Balkans. **********Since Croatia, like Slovenia to the north, declared independence from the Yugoslav federation on June 25, local militias here have fought Serbian insurgents drawn from Croatia's Serbian minority and increasingly supported by the Serb-dominated federal forces. **********Croatian Radio said \"fierce fighting\" was in progress in the eastern border area with Serbia, Yugoslavia's most populous component and the seat of the internationally-recognized federal Government in Belgrade.

But for Iran, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, the United States and some Western European nations, the time may have arrived for successfully closing out an ugly chapter of confrontation that has obsessed and dominated the region's conscience and haunted American politics.  A Self-Propelled Iran **********Trying to answer the question \"why now?\" Richard Murphy, the former Assistant Secretary of State who supervised United States policy in the Middle East for most of the 1980's, said that while Syria has been maneuvering for several years to win the release of the Western hostages, Iran's post-revolutionary leadership has not been able to make a clear-cut decision to press the pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon to release their captives. **********\"The Syrians have never wanted to push Iran,\" Mr. Murphy said, \"and Iran wasn't interested for a long time. But now the Syrians don't have to push them, because the Iranians are self-propelled -- not that there still aren't divided councils in Teheran.\" **********\"Local politics\" in Lebanon among the kidnapping groups is also a factor, an Administration official asserted. \"They've held those people for six years and haven't gotten anything for the Islamic revolution,\" he said. \"And hostages are only valuable if they are traded.\" **********The precise change in Iran that helped set off the release of two hostages in the last week remains a mystery, but Mr. Murphy argues that in the multifactioned ruling environment of Teheran, events today probably represent the culmination of forces that have been building for years. And those forces are well known.  Culmination of Forces **********After its eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, Iran was devastated economically. Its agricultural base has declined as its population has soared. Even before the death in 1989 of the uncompromising revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Teheran was looking to marshal massive resources to rebuild a shattered economy. That could happen only with Western investment and technology. **********\"I think we are finally seeing it work out,\" said Mr. Murphy. **********Did the final factors include United States relief flights to Iran last spring, when hundreds of thousands ofIraqi Kurds overwhelmed Iranian refugee centers? Mr. Murphy said that might have added to the momentum. **********Another factor is that the United States, after a period of mixed signals that included the covert arms-for-hostages trading in the Iran-contra scandal, might have convinced Teheran's leaders that future trade, transfers of technology and financing cannot flow while Terry A. Anderson and his fellow hostages remain chained to radiators in Beirut's basement dungeons. **********For Syria, the end of the cold war and the American-led struggle against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq provided an obvious pretext for President Hafez al-Assad to reposition himself as an ally of the West. But what began as a tactical and perhaps transitory realignment by Mr. Assad might be turning into a strategic transformation for the man who came to prominence in the Middle East as the chief rejectionist. Fulfilling Assad's Interests **********\"Ever since he came to power, Assad's interests have not been fulfilled by going the peaceful route,\" said Graham Fuller, a Rand Corporation analyst who served as a senior Middle East specialist in the Reagan Administration. \"What Syria got out of being the leader of the hell-no crowd -- oil money, leadership of the Palestinian cause and Soviet arms -- made him a dominant force for 15 years. **********\"Now for the first time,\" Mr. Fuller continued, \"Syria is benefiting more from peace than from controlled confrontation and to me that is the real revolution in Syrian thinking.\" **********Thus, Syria's interests in Lebanon's hostage problem are far more subtle and vital to Mr. Assad's survival as a regional power. **********Since Lebanon was destabilized with the outbreak of civil war in the mid-1970's, Mr. Assad has been engaged in a struggle with Israel for effective control of his western flank, Lebanon. After two major Syrian military incursions into Lebanon and the humiliation of the Israeli invasion in 1982, Syria has forcefully backed a new Government in Beirut and emerged the demonstrable victor; Lebanon's new leadership is and is likely to remain pointedly pro-Syrian.  Removing Threats to Israel **********To keep Israel from reasserting a major role in Lebanon through partial occupation and military incursions against guerrilla bases, Mr. Assad must remove the security threats that face his sworn enemy, some analysts argue. **********One way to do that would be to win the freedom not only of the Western hostages, but of Israel's captive servicemen held by either pro-Iranian militiamen or Palestinian guerrillas. Once that is done, a Syrian-backed effort to demilitarize southern Lebanon and disarm the still independent militias there would, over time, remove Israel's pretext for continued occupation. **********How Syria brings peace to Lebanon also has a direct effect on the Middle East peace process, which has reached the sensitive stage of convening an international peace conference for direct talks between Israel and its Arab enemies.  Fine Line for Israelis **********Mr. Assad's performance in bringing security to southern Lebanon will bear directly on any argument he makes that Israel should return to Damascus control over the Golan Heights, seized in 1967. **********According to Willaim Quandt, Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution who served in the Carter White House, Israel will have to walk a fine line in responding to the \"good will\" and momentum of the hostage releases last week while not giving away its leverage over the kidnappers. **********Among its hundreds of Arab prisoners whose freedom is sought by the kidnappers, Israel's main leverage is Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, who Israel accuses of being a spiritual leader of the Party of God in South Lebanon. Israel abducted Sheik Obeid in 1989. **********\"If they go ahead and release Sheik Obeid and this leads to the release of American hostages, they are going to get some credit in the United States,\" Mr. Quandt said. \"If it doesn't cost them too much, they will seek to get it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/business/strong-earnings-are-posted-by-three-gm-subsidiaries.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1991-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strong Earnings Are Posted by Three G.M.

And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 29/32, up by 2/32, to yield 5.50 percent.  Short-Term Rates Down **********Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower. **********In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.52 percent, down by 4 basis points, or four one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.55 percent.

Representative Don Ritter, Republican of Pennsylvania, proposed \"a strategy to hold Mr. Gorbachev's feet to the fire,\" with a goal of stripping him of his Nobel Peace Prize. Delay in Summit Meeting **********The legislators' recommendations included postponing a Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting scheduled for next month and taking up diplomatic relations with the three Baltic governments. The United States refused to acknowledge the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940 and continues to maintain ties with the vestigial diplomatic missions of those countries in Washington.

H. Seitz said the Administration had a number of punitive measures \"more or less under review.\" **********Mr. Seitz, who is responsible for European and Canadian affairs at the department, said the Administration was considering a proposal to elevate the Baltic states to the status of observers at sessions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That conference is the permanent forum that grew out of the 35-government Helsinki agreement of 1975. **********Asked whether the United States might send a special high-level delegation to the Baltics to show solidarity with the independence movements, Mr. Seitz said that, too, was under consideration. **********Representative Steny H.

Combating a Slowdown **********\"The lottery industry is looking for ways to expand its horizons,\" said Connie Scovin, an executive with the Control Data Corporation, the Minneapolis-based company that developed the idea and is designing the test system. **********Nearly a third of the nation's homes have Nintendo sets, and if the Minnesota test is successful, Control Data plans to make the system available to other states. **********The test will involve 10,000 homes next year. For the test, the state will provide the video game sets and the modem devices that allow them to communicate with a central computer. Participants, who will pay a service charge of $10 a month, will get software that lets them play all of Minnesota's games, including the biggest jackpots. **********After players set up accounts with the lottery, they will be able to select their lottery numbers on their television sets at home. The numbers will be stored electronically in the central lottery computer and in a file in the player's Nintendo set. **********Small prizes will be credited to the player's account. To collect a large jackpot, winners will have to go to a state lottery office and identify themselves as the holder of the winning account. **********It is illegal in Minnesota for minors to play lottery games, and the Nintendo plan has been criticized by the State Attorney General and others who say it will make it easy for children to gamble. The system will have passwords and other safeguards intended to thwart unauthorized playing. **********\"Kids are gambling now; this will allow them to gamble more,\" said Tony Bouza, the former Gaming Commissioner in Minnesota. Young people today are well acquainted with technology, and they will inevitably devise ways to bypass the security measures, he predicted. He also said that gambling at home by adults sets a bad example for children. \"You can't create safe sins,\" he said. **********But others say the new system could serve a broader purpose, providing the catalyst that will encourage more people to use computers and phone lines to tap into a growing pool of information and services. **********Nintendo's use as a gambling device may help put spark into the market for such on-line services, said Gary Arlen of Arlen Communications Inc., a research firm in Bethesda, Md. \"I've been looking for the killer service,\" he said. \"This is the kind of thing that makes sense.\" **********For more than a decade, large corporations like Sears, Roebuck and I.B.M. have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in networks that allow people to shop, read the news, and make travel reservations using home computers linked to telephone lines. Such systems, including a Sears-I.B.M. joint venture, Prodigy Services Company, have been somewhat cumbersome to use and have been viewed more as a novelty than a necessary adjunct to daily life. Only about 3 percent of the households in the United States use an on-line service like Prodigy, Mr. Arlen said. **********But as giant corporations have stumbled, Nintendo has been lurking in the background, the envy of the industry, with 30 million units already in use. Nintendo has had its eye on far more than the video-game market since it sold its first machine in the United States in 1986. **********In Japan, Nintendo customers use their machines for banking and for buying and selling stocks. In a prescient bit of engineering, Nintendo included a plug to snap in a modem on the bottom of every machine sold in the United States. **********With the lottery game, Nintendo will introduce its modem to the United States. As a contractor to Control Data, Nintendo will supply the modem and a specially designed software cartridge that provides lottery graphics. Control Data officials said Nintendo was providing the 10,000 machines and the other equipment for the test at no cost. The machines retail for about $80. **********People who already have Nintendo machines would have to retrofit them with a modem to take advantage of on-line services. Computer modems are currently available for less than $100, and Mr. Arlen said Nintendo engineers could probably come up with a modem that would cost $50 to $75. Still, he questioned how many consumers would be willing to nearly double their investment in the machines. **********Nintendo has also explored setting up a game network in which players could challenge other players, and has considered a stock trading service with Fidelity Services of Boston. Both projects are on hold. Nintendo said in a statement, \"We are constantly approached by third parties who have ideas that are outside the traditional video-game arena.\" **********Some in the industry say Nintendo may harm its image by its association with a lottery. They note that the company is already under fire from some parents and educators who say its games lack educational content. **********\"It's Jimmy the Greek comes home to your kid's bedroom,\" said Bob Heitman, general manager of the Sierra Network, a computerized game network that charges players to use its service. The network is a unit of Sierra On-Line Inc., a maker of computer games. **********\"I have a bad feeling for lotteries,\" he said. \"As a family game company, I would not do it or advocate that our company do it.\"  New Uses for Older Machines **********For Nintendo, the lottery business could help prolong the life of its older model, which has been outmoded by a more powerful Nintendo machine introduced in the United States last month. Also, the introduction of gambling could help combat the general decline in interest in video games. **********In a statement, Nintendo said, \"This test could provide us with some insights into the potential for further network applications; however, our main focus is to find the kind of entertainment software that will truly take advantage of that potential.\" **********Nintendo says that its machines are more than just toys and that 35 percent of Nintendo players are over the age of 18. Minnesota lottery officials and Control Data executives say their system's safeguards should be adequate to keep children from playing the lottery at home. Otho Brown, a vice president of Control Data, likened the situation to banking through automatic teller machines -- parents who keep the password a secret should have no concern about a child's misusing a cash card. **********The lottery system has a number of built-in safeguards, including a feature that disables the unit if an incorrect password is entered. Becoming eligible to play the lottery at home is an involved process that requires mailing in a copy of a driver's license or other photo identification. And, all play is prepaid through deposits the account holders make with the lottery, so no one can run up a big unpaid bill. A $50 daily limit will be put on each player. Control Data's Hopes **********If the home system is successful, it could provide an important business advantage for Control Data. The Minnesota-based company lags behind the Gtech Corporation of West Greenwich, R.I., the leader in supplying computer equipment and services to lotteries. **********\"We entered the test with the idea that lotteries would use it nationwide,\" said Mr. Brown of Control Data. He said lottery growth has slowed because the games have already attracted all the people interested in playing. **********Nationwide, more than $20 billion was spent on lottery tickets last year, an increase of 2.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries in Washington. There are lotteries in 33 states and the District of Columbia. **********As a result of the slowdown in the rate of growth, Mr. Brown said the lottery industry has been exploring ways to increase the appeal of the games and attract new types of customers. A group of state lotteries is considering sponsoring a nationally televised lottery show. **********Mr. Brown said Nintendo owners are better educated and more affluent than the typical lottery players. He said that if home lottery play caught on, it could increase volume by 10 percent to 15 percent a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/19/business/company-news-ameritech-plans-to-cut-2300-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1991-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ameritech Plans to Cut 2,300 Jobs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ameritech Plans to Cut 2,300 Jobs", "body_text": " **********Following the lead of other regional Bell operating companies seeking to cut costs, Ameritech said yesterday that it planned to use attrition and layoffs to trim its work force by nearly 2,300, or 3 percent, over several years. **********Ameritech is taking a quarterly charge of $140 million, or 53 cents a share. This includes costs for severance pay, as well as separate charges for the write-down of certain assets in unregulated businesses like audiotext, and the early retirement of high-interest debt. **********All the Bell telephone companies, as well as the GTE Corporation, must compete against a growing number of smaller, often more efficient telecommunications companies. These concerns can woo away the giant phone companies' most lucrative business customers while saddling the local carriers with more tightly regulated, and often less profitable, phone service for residential customers. The residential market in many areas has also been growing far more slowly than the market for business customers. Plans to Cut Work Force **********Other \"Baby Bells\" have either taken or are considering similar charges for layoffs. Nynex, in New York and New England, said last month that it planned to reduce its work force by 9,900 and take a $550 million charge, most of it for severance pay and other costs. U S West took a similar $590 million charge. **********Ameritech, based in Chicago, has about 75,700 workers and provides local service for Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana. It posted 199o revenue of $10.66 billion. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech's shares rose 37.5 cents yesterday to $63.125. **********Ameritech also said it would increase its quarterly dividend, but at about half the usual annual rate of 7.3 percent. It increased the dividend 3 cents, to 88 cents a share, or $3.52 annually. William L. Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said in a statement, \"We recognize the importance of dividends to our shareowners,\" but added that the level of increase was in line with the company's lower operating performance. **********The $140 million charge, taken this month, will lower fourth-quarter earnings by more than half of the $1.05 a share that analysts had expected. **********Full-year profit is likely to be about $4.17 a share, down nearly 12 percent from the $4.73 a year earlier, which included 28 cents of one-time gains from the sale of assets. **********Marion M. Boucher, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the Ameritech action was \"a fairly routine charge that should have a positive impact on earnings.\" She raised her estimate of 1992 earnings to $4.82 a share from $4.76. **********About $52 million of the $140 million charge results from work force reductions, mainly because of the planned job consolidation and layoffs over the next three to five years. Voluntary Retirement Program **********Less than 20 percent of the $52 million is also associated with a voluntary retirement program, announced earlier this year, intended to reduce the number of managers by 2,000 by the end of this month. Ameritech was not more specific. **********Another $67 million is for the writedown, or the reduction in value, of assets in less successful businesses. These businesses are in the unregulated portion of Ameritech's business that go beyond what the industry calls Plain Old Telephone Service, or POTS. They include Ameritech's venture into audiotext, an information service available over the telephone through \"800\" and \"900\" numbers. **********The balance of $21 million is for a variety of charges including costs associated with the advance payment of $175 million in debentures due in 2001.

After all, the Americans had just won the war, and we didn't even know the Soviet Union was one of the Allies. But then we overheard them talking about Stalin.\" **********The Soviets took the last of the islands a day after Japan's formal surrender, expelling Mr. Yanami and 17,384 other residents -- the Japanese are nothing if not precise, and they have accounted for everyone -- and leaving behind a legacy of bitterness that the Government maintains is shared by all of Japan. **********On Tuesday, building on a four-decade-long public relations campaign, the aging refugees of the islands off Japan's northern coast see one great chance to win their Northern Territories back: the arrival of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the first Soviet leader ever to visit Japan.  Soviets Seek Japan's Help **********The 46-year-old occupation of the islands -- Etorofu (which the Soviets call Iturup), Kunashiri (Kunashir), Shikotan and the Habomai group -- has turned into something of a national obsession in Japan, an obsession fed by influential right-wing groups, powerful fishing organizations and the former islanders themselves. For years this fast-declining fishing town has been dotted with signboards with the rallying cry \"Kaese!\" -- \"Give them back!\" -- and the Government has made it clear that a give-back will be the price next week if Mr. Gorbachev wants billions of dollars of Japanese consumer goods, technology for Soviet factories and Japanese-financed oil exploration in Siberia. **********It is a price that many Japanese officials suspect Mr. Gorbachev will be unable or unwilling to pay. Yet here in Nemuro, the former islanders who live within sight of their old homeland -- the closest island is only two miles away -- are spending their days spreading and dashing rumors of a secret deal in the works. **********For several weeks hopes have risen on reports that Japan may be prepared to pay upwards of $28 billion, masked as economic aid, to regain sovereignty over the islands. That comes to roughly $22,680 an acre for one of the world's most remote, ice-blocked and inhospitable corners. Then the other day a Japanese newspaper quoted the Soviet Defense Minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, as saying there would be absolutely no deal. **********Mr. Gorbachev's staff also tried to reduce expectations as they arrived in Tokyo this week. \"This is a problem that has gone on for a hundred years,\" said Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman. \"It will not be solved overnight.\" Nasty Battles Brewing **********Even though it is hard to find anyone here under the age of 70 who says he is actually willing to move back to the islands, nasty battles are already brewing as Japanese families jostle for long-lost property rights. **********Mr. Gorbachev may well offer to acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over two of the islands closest to Japanese shores and promise to talk about the other two, a deal that the Soviets briefly put forward and Japan rejected a quarter-century ago. Taking an uncharacteristically hard-line stance, Japan's Foreign Ministry has left little room for such compromises, saying that for the visit to be a success Mr. Gorbachev must now recognize Japan's claim to all four -- even if the actual turnover takes years. **********No one can quite explain why the issue has such an emotional appeal for Japan, save for the fact that the Japanese are inculcated from childhood that they live in a small country with no land to spare. When foreigners suggest that the loss of the islands was a relatively small price for Japan to pay for its colonial forays into Korea, Manchuria and vast stretches of Southeast Asia, islanders here respond with cold stares. U.S. Is Blamed Too **********\"Certainly Japan was responsible for starting the war,\" Mitsuo Takaiwa, a prosperous-looking former fisherman. But, he said, the Soviets are more to blame for exploiting Japan's helplessness in the last days of the war, in violation of a nonaggression pact between the two nations. \"The U.S. is responsible, too,\" he said, \"for allowing the Soviet Union to do that.\" **********More than 9,000 fishermen have been detained by the Soviets for poaching in the island waters, and fishing seems to be one major reason Japan wants the territory back. The area around Nemuro was harvested to the point of depletion, and major fisheries stand to gain millions of dollars if the islands come back. **********But the people of Nemuro say they do not want to kick out the 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet citizens now living on the disputed territory, a figure that includes a large number of military personnel. \"I think it may be possible to live together,\" says Hirotoshi Kawata, a 56-year-old city official who remembers befriending a soldier named Aleksei who was part of the invading party. **********But for the 11,000 surviving islanders, the war will not really be over until the islands are repatriated. **********\"The islands were rich when I was there, and I have always dreamed of returning,\" Shoji Ashizaki, who once lived on the Habomais. \"We Japanese know we can make them rich again.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/business/germany-rolls-out-its-fast-train.html": {"writer_name": "Ferdinand Protzman", "pub_date": "1991-05-30", "snippet": "Germany's state-owned railroad system formally introduced its new high-speed train service today, as slick, computer-controlled trains capable of speeds of 250 miles an hour carried 4,000 guests to a coming-out party in Kassel, a crossroads city l...", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germany Rolls Out Its Fast Train", "print_headline": "Germany Rolls Out Its Fast Train", "body_text": " **********Germany's state-owned railroad system formally introduced its new high-speed train service today, as slick, computer-controlled trains capable of speeds of 250 miles an hour carried 4,000 guests to a coming-out party in Kassel, a crossroads city lying almost precisely at the country's geographic center. **********President Richard von Weizsacker officially started the Deutsche Bundesbahn's new Inter-City Express service at noon by pressing a button on a computer control panel. **********\"I am confident that the high-speed trains will encourage a renaissance in rail travel,\" said Mr. von Weizsacker, who had arrived 15 minutes late because, a Bundesbahn spokesman explained, someone accidentally activated the emergency brakes on the President's high-speed train during the trip from Bonn, about 80 miles away. **********More than two dozen Inter-City Express trains will begin regular service Sunday morning on a newly built line linking Hamburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich and cities in between.

But it also costs more. **********Industry experts said experience and more flexible pricing made France's TGV trains and the Japanese \"bullet\" trains the front-runners in the bidding to build high-speed lines in other Western European countries and in the United States. Canada, South Korea and Taiwan are also accepting bids on high-speed train systems, while Australia, Brazil and the Soviet Union are considering such projects. **********Price was apparently a factor on Tuesday when the Texas High Speed Rail Authority chose a $5.7 billion bid by a consortium that included GEC Alsthom of France and the Morrison Knudsen Corporation of the United States to build a high-speed line linking Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. Texas rejected the German consortium's $6.7 billion bid. **********The new German trains are gleaming white with a single red stripe down each side and can carry up to 750 passengers at an average speed of 150 miles an hour. **********They will cut travel time from Hamburg to Frankfurt by one hour to three and a half hours and will shave two hours off the trip from Hamburg in the country's north to Munich in the south, making it about seven hours. A one-way ticket between those two cities will cost $176 in first class and $117 in second, or 14 percent more than regular express-train fares. **********Each train, which costs $30 million and is a single unit with engines at both ends, is sealed and pressurized like an airliner. Passengers can listen to a variety of music channels or radio on headphones. Small television sets are imbedded in the backs of some seats, allowing passengers to watch videos. **********The new high-speed train service is one of the few bright spots the Bundesbahn has had in recent years. Despite annual Government subsidies of about $8 billion, the Bundesbahn lost $2.9 billion in 1990, after losing $2.26 billion the year before. It has debts of $27.68 billion. **********Heinz Durr, the Bundesbahn president, said he expected the Bundesbahn's losses to deepen in 1991, even though ridership was up about 6 percent in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier, and freight volume had risen around 8 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/21/business/finance-new-issues-pollution-control-project-financed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pollution-Control Project Financed", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Pollution-Control Project Financed", "body_text": " **********The New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation yesterday priced a $48 million water-pollution-control revenue bond through competitive bidding won by Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********The bond offering, involving a Westchester County project, was bought and reoffered to the public at a price to yield from 4.4 percent for a bond due in 1992 to 5.35 percent in 1996, 5.95 percent in 2001, 6.4 percent in 2006 and 6.5 percent for bonds due in 2008 through 2011. **********Underwriters said the issue was rated triple-A by Moody's, S.&.

I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, one of the world's largest agricultural chemical producers, said yesterday that they had formed an alliance to develop naturally occurring insect viruses into pesticides. **********Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., will provide Crop Genetics with up to $3.7 million over two years to develop virus products and mass-produce them at low cost with a proprietary process. Du Pont is expected to help formulate the products so they can be applied inexpensively to crops, to help them gain regulatory approval and to help sell them. Profit sharing will be negotiated case by case as products are ready for market, the companies said. **********In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Crop Genetics' stock shot up 72.2 percent, gaining $3.25, to $7.75. It was that market's biggest gainer in percentage terms. **********The first targets will be caterpillars that attack fruits and vegetables. Crop Genetics, based in Hanover, Md., submitted three such viruses to the Environmental Protection Agency for registration as a new pesticide last summer. The process normally takes up to a year for products that do not involve genetic engineering. **********Like other naturally occurring insect killers, or biopesticides, the viruses have potentially important environmental benefits compared with synthetic chemical products produced by Du Pont and other chemical giants. The viruses are deadly only to the insects in which they are found, and even then only when present in larger concentrations than are commonly found. **********The viruses also tend to break down relatively quickly into environmentally harmless remains when they are outside their host insect. Thus, farmers could spray large concentrations on crops without harming helpful insects, other animals, farmworkers or consumers. A Major Drawback **********The biggest roadblock to using viruses as pesticides is that they may take several days to kill an insect. That has not stopped the Agriculture Department from developing Gypcheck, a virus used against the gypsy moth by the Forestry Service. But the private sector has remained primarily committed to synthetic chemicals, and most new biopesticides are based on toxic proteins found in naturally occurring bacteria that quickly kill specific insects. **********A virus manufactured in the 1970's by Sandoz Ltd. of Switzerland for use against the boll weevil failed commercially. **********\"Growers want to see bugs dying right away,\" said Fred Betz, a microbial pesticides expert at the E.P.A. **********Joseph Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of Crop Genetics, said farmers were increasingly willing to be patient in using a product that was more environmentally sound. But he stressed that the viruses would most likely be used with other biological and chemical pesticides. **********For example, a virus might be applied when a vegetable was first emerging from the ground, but a chemical would be used if the plant was nearly mature to kill insects as quickly as possible and preserve its appearance. Various Methods Urged **********Frank R. Owen, the global product manager for Du Pont's $1.7 billion agricultural chemicals group, noted that rotating among different types of pesticides would make it harder for insects to develop resistance to any one product. **********Du Pont's only other venture into biopesticides so far has been a two-year-old agreement to handle the marketing in the United States of Biobit, an anti-caterpillar toxin isolated from a common bacteria by Novo-Nordisk A.S. of Denmark. **********The worldwide market for pesticides affecting leading crops, including insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, is thought to be about $20 billion.

They really were passionate. This may sound silly, but they really wanted it.\" **********The magazine put its account under review several months ago when it became clear that its longtime agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners, would lose several top executives when it merged into the new firm Lord, Dentsu & Partners. **********The agencies that participated in the review, in addition to Goodby and Lord, Dentsu, were Deutsch Inc. and Omon Advertising. Edward McCabe, the copywriting star who recently started his own agency, McCabe & Company, also made a pitch, Mr. Florio said. **********Martin H.

The New Yorker, Mr. Landey said, is particularly valuable. **********\"It's probably more visible because it's a New York magazine and because the creme de la creme of advertisers are in the magazine,\" he said. **********Mr. Florio said he was adamant that the winner of the review have a New York office, and he stipulated that Goodby must establish a physical presence in New York.

It echoed an earlier, unpublished warning by Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi chief of intelligence, who made his comments in a rare public speech at a mosque in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Saudi officials said by telephone from Saudi Arabia. **********These developments, whose details are just coming out of Saudi Arabia, are unfolding at a time when militant fundamentalists have grown in number in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region. Fundamentalists have already taken over in the Sudan, which has aligned itself with Iran. **********In Saudi Arabia the number of fundamentalists has grown considerably since the Persian Gulf crisis began in the summer of 1990. They are now estimated to include tens of thousands of younger radical religious leaders, Islamic university teachers and students. **********Islamic fundamentalists are challenging several governments in the Middle East that are secular in their orientation, like those in Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. But their challenge to the Saudi Government, which is fundamentalist, suggests in the view of experts that they are using religion to change the established order. **********Saudi Arabia strictly observes Islamic precepts and edicts in everyday life, banning alcohol, demanding that women wear veils, making prayer obligatory five times a day and requiring religion as a part of education. **********In the view of most Saudi affairs experts, the militants do not constitute a mortal danger to the Saudi Government. But ever since a group of them took over the Grand Mosque of Mecca in 1979 -- they were routed in a bloody battle with Saudi forces after a two-week siege -- they have become a growing disruptive force, and the Government has decided to challenge them. **********As the movement spread, it seemed to feed off the frustrations of hundreds of thousands of university graduates unable to find jobs or suitable employment. It has been self-sustaining, with no evidence of foreign financial support. **********Over the last few months, the militant elements, which discreetly coordinate their activities through religious societies and mosques, have adopted a strategy of attacking Government policies in public speeches in the mosques and in university lectures. **********More important, they have been recording and distributing their assaults on Government policies and personalities, including several officials, columnists and senior religious leaders, in hundreds of thousands of audio cassettes widely available in every city of the country in what the Saudi Government now regards as a menacing, subversive campaign. Sweeping Attacks **********The fundamentalists' assaults on the Saudi Government have been aimed at virtually every aspect of domestic and foreign policy. **********They have criticized the arrival of American troops during the gulf crisis. They have attacked Saudi Arabia's support of the Middle East peace negotiations sponsored by the United States and have opposed any talk of peace with Israel. **********The fundamentalists have also described the Saudi Government's banking and financial policies, particularly Saudi Arabia's growing role as a major power in international finance. **********The criticism by the religious militants has in the last few weeks also stretched to Saudi Arabia's educational system and the participation of women in higher education, even though education of men and women is strictly segregated. They have gone so far as to call leading female educators in the country \"prostitutes.\" **********Sheik Ibn Baz, a blind man who commands enormous reverence among the Saudi public and within the vast traditionalist religious establishment, singled out those who he said \"whisper secretly in their meetings and record their poison over cassettes distributed to the people, or those who make these allegations in public lectures at universities.\" **********\"This behavior,\" Sheik Ibn Baz warned, \"is against the will of God.\" 'Lies and Conspiracies' **********The sheik is President of the Administration of Scientific Research, Religious Scholarship and Guidance. His post is roughly the equivalent of several ministerial positions overseeing all religious affairs and supervising the country's mosques, religious universities and educational authorities and the religious affairs police. While considered an ally of the Saudi ruling family, Sheik Ibn Baz is somewhat independent in his views and thus enjoys an authority that is separate from the will of the ruling family. **********He went on in his statement, which was published in detail in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat on Saturday, to condemn the militants' assertions as \"lies,\" and \"conspiracies against Islam and Muslims.\" **********\"Many of those who pretend to have knowledge and a religious calling,\" he said, \"have, in this day and age, surfaced to contest and injure established religious leaders, doing so secretly in their gatherings, or proclaiming their views openly in sermons in the mosques, or recording these views on cassettes that are distributed among the people. **********\"I counsel those who have misguided youths and filled them with hatred and conspiracies and erroneous gossip about such and such person, to repent and to desist for these activities.\" **********Among other things, some of the public speeches and cassettes of the Saudi religious militants over the last few weeks publicly attacked the Saudi Women's Renaissance Association, with which several of the royal family's princesses and prominent Saudi women are associated. The militants described the women as \"prostitutes\" and demanded that the association be disbanded. **********The move prompted a rare response by Prince Turki, the son of the late King Faisal, in a speech made a mosque. According to several Saudis familiar with the situation, Prince Turki accused the militants of slandering some of his acquaintances. **********\"The thrust of his message was, 'You have gone too far,' \" said a Saudi businessman who has firsthand knowledge of the Prince's comments. \"It's more than a warning. It's the beginning of a confrontation by a senior and powerful member of the Saudi royal family.\" **********Taken together, the retorts by an eminent member of the ruling family and the traditional religious establishment are unusual in their severity, indicating that a new threshold of confrontation between the ruling establishment and radical militants has been reached. **********The Saudi ruling establishment's reaction, not coincidentally, parallels major recent policy initiatives by King Fahd, who announced a few weeks ago his intention to institute a \"consultative council\" and publish a body of written civil laws regulating business activities and civic litigation. **********These steps were widely viewed as necessary to support Saudi Arabia's fast-changing status as a major economic force, and essential to permit the growth and evolution of the Saudi private sector, which works in association with foreign, mostly Western, banks, companies and financial institutions. **********These trends are fiercely resisted by the xenophobic militant elements in Saudi Arabia because they threaten to seriously dilute their control over the ordinary lives of Saudi citizens and give the establishment a strong base to push for more modernization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/world/aid-to-bangladesh-is-still-hampered.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AID TO BANGLADESH IS STILL HAMPERED", "print_headline": "AID TO BANGLADESH IS STILL HAMPERED", "body_text": " **********Survivors of last week's cyclone in Bangladesh are suffering from a lack of food and clean water, and many could die of disease, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said today. **********The official Cyclone Preparedness Center said the death toll as of this evening was 125,672, up only slightly from the previous day. **********\"An estimated four million people are now at serious risk from lack of fresh drinking water and food,\" a statement issued by the league said. \"Many more deaths could follow from lack of water, food and disease.\" **********Red Crescent officials said the toll could climb to 200,000 when rescue and relief teams reached isolated areas.

The oil companies are depending on these reformulated blends to blunt campaigns by some environmentalists to restrict gasoline sales sharply in the years ahead. **********\"The Exxons of the world are trying to protect themselves from a shortage situation,\" said Urvan Sternfels, president of the National Petroleum Refiners Association, a trade group based in Washington. \"There is a really serious question as to whether there is going to be enough oxygenates available to meet all of the new demand that we anticipate.\" **********William I. Ludlow, vice president of DeWitt & Company, a consulting firm in Houston, said current supplies of M.T.B.E. appeared adequate to meet demand in the next few years, but could become tight when regulations are stiffened in 1995. **********M.T.B.E. includes an oxygen molecule that permits more thorough combustion of fuel by engines and reduces carbon monoxide and other exhaust emissions. The chemical compound had been used since the mid-1980's to raise octane levels in premium gasoline blends, but refiners have promoted it in the last few years as a way to reduce pollutants. **********The Clean Air Act mandates higher oxygen levels in gasoline next year in areas where carbon dioxide pollution produces a brown haze during the winter months, especially in high-altitude areas like Denver.  Practical Components **********M.T.B.E. and ethanol are considered the two most practical components available to refiners to raise oxygen levels to at least 2.7 percent of the gasoline mixture. Aromatics like benzene and toluene, once used to raise octane levels, have been restricted because of concerns that they help to create smog and may contribute to cancer. **********Mr. Sternfels of the refiners association said many refiners favored M.T.B.E. because ethanol was more costly and could not be blended into gasoline transported through pipelines. Also, the building blocks of M.T.B.E., the common chemical feedstocks isobutylene and methanol, can be easily supplied. **********Total consumption of M.T.B.E. increased to 96,000 barrels a day last year, from 30,000 barrels a day in 1985, and will probably triple again to more than 300,000 barrels a day by 1995, said Joe Leonard, a petrochemical industry analyst at Chem Systems Inc., a consulting firm in Tarrytown, N.Y. **********\"As more and more gasolines are reformulated for more cleaner-burning characteristics, M.T.B.E. will go into all gasolines, not just premium blends,\" he said. **********As recently as a year ago, few refiners produced their own M.T.B.E.; ARCO Chemical, which is 83 percent owned by ARCO Inc., accounted for 40 percent of the world's supply. Since then, Chevron, Conoco, Shell, Unocal, Amerada Hess and Mobil have announced plans to build plants within existing refineries.  Big Plants Planned **********Most of these plants will produce fewer than 5,000 barrels of M.T.B.E. a day for use within the same gasoline refineries. But Tenneco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum are building plants to produce more than 10,000 barrels a day and plan to sell much of the output to other gasoline refiners. **********With M.T.B.E. becoming a more important cost factor in gasoline output and future supplies uncertain, refiners want captive supplies, Mr. Sternfels said. **********Exxon U.S.A. currently buys M.T.B.E. from a sister company, Exxon Chemical, and from other suppliers. A spokesman for Exxon U.S.A., Henry Beathard, said the company decided to build its new plants because \"we can produce it more cheaply than we can purchase it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/21/business/company-news-symantec-is-set-to-acquire-dma.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Symantec Is Set To Acquire DMA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Symantec Is Set To Acquire DMA", "body_text": " **********The Symantec Corporation said today it will acquire Dynamic Microprocessor Associates Inc., known as DMA, in a stock swap valued at about $22 million.

Despite that, until this week the company that was clearly second in achieving this goal, Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., was able to exert patent claims at least as strong as Amgen's. **********The court had long ago established that Dr. Fu-Kuen Lin of Amgen was the first person to isolate the human gene for EPO in 1984. It was also Dr. Lin who first produced the protein by inserting the gene into cells from a Chinese hamster. Patent Obtained on Molecule **********Until this week, however, Genetics Institute had the upper hand on patents for EPO. In 1987, it obtained a patent on the EPO molecule itself, which it had isolated and purified from human urine. Amgen never made use of this development. **********Strictly speaking, the Genetics Institute development had nothing to do with genetic engineering and had almost no commercial usefulness. Natural EPO is so rare that it is impossible to obtain in commercial volumes from natural sources. Thus, both companies were racing to achieve the same ultimate goal: finding the EPO gene, so the protein could be harvested in large quantities from genetically transformed animal cells. **********But the Genetics Institute patent on the molecule was of great value as a legal tool. Following accepted doctrine in patent law, the Federal District Court in Boston decided that Genetics Institute's patent covered EPO regardless of how it is produced. As a result, it ruled last year that Amgen's recombinant version of EPO infringed its rival's patent and it ordered Amgen to enter a cross-licensing agreement.  Ruling Reversed **********The appeals court decision this week reversed that order, though not on the ground of fundamental principle. The decision, written by Judge Alan D. Lourie, concludes that Genetics Institute never clearly demonstrated that it had purified a molecule with the biological characteristics it had claimed in its patent. As a result, the court declared the patent's key claims invalid. **********For many experts, however, the big question is whether patents like those of Genetics Institute are simply being applied too broadly even when they are valid. \"It was already known that EPO existed, as well as what it did and where you could get it,\" said Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney in Washington. \"What was so novel and non-obvious about purifying it from urine?\" Indeed, EPO was so well known to researchers that numerous biotech companies, including Genentech Inc., joined the race to find the EPO gene until Amgen announced Dr. Lin's findings. **********This issue may well arise with other drugs, because the allure of biotechnology is largely in its potential for producing large volumes of proteins that are known but are rare in nature. Indeed, the issue was at the heart of a legal dispute over patent rights to Factor VIII, a blood-clotting drug used to combat hemophelia. In that case, involving the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation and Genentech, a Federal district court ruled that Scripps's patent on the molecule was invalid for a host of technical and procedural reasons. **********But even critics like Mr. Wegner have trouble defining the scope of claims for patents on purified natural proteins. Traditionally, patent law has held that patents for novel compounds should cover those materials no matter how they are produced. The reason is that lab bench processes for making them will always be different from mass production processes, and the initial challenge is to develop the material itself. **********But in biotechnology, the production process is central. Without genetic engineering, there is simply no real commercial product. As a result, some experts say the courts should view a protein produced by gene splicing as, in effect, a new protein. **********\"The theory here is that the second inventor has contributed something much more valuable than the original molecule,\" argued Robert P. Merges, associate professor of law at Boston University. Indeed, Dr. Merges said, there is already some precedent for this principle in patent law, but the courts have thus far not applied it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/21/world/after-the-war-bush-links-end-of-trading-ban-to-hussein-exit.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1991-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 965, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Links End Of Trading Ban To Hussein Exit", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Bush Links End Of Trading Ban To Hussein Exit", "body_text": " **********President Bush said today that the United States would oppose the lifting of the worldwide ban against trading with Iraq until President Saddam Hussein is forced out of power in Baghdad. **********His statement, along with earlier remarks by the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, indicated strongly that the United States has decided to try to drive Mr. Hussein from power through a postwar policy of economic strangulation. **********Implicit in the statements by Mr. Bush and his spokesman was a threat to use the veto authority that the United States holds in the United Nations Security Council as one of its five permanent members to oppose lifting the sanctions against Iraq. **********In his first comments on the trials of Kuwaitis accused of collaboration with Iraqi occupation forces, Mr. Bush today said Kuwait should extend fair-trial protections to the accused.  [ Page A10. ] Security Council Acts **********A mechanism for a controlled lifting of the trade ban, approved today by the Security Council, would permit Mr. Hussein's Government to begin selling its crude oil to pay for reparations to Kuwait. Also, Iraq has asked for permission to finance urgent cargos of food, medicine and basic raw materials by selling its oil. **********But the Council has not taken the decisive action to allow the sale of oil to begin. The statements by Washington and earlier comments by the British Government indicate that such a move may be a long time in coming as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power. **********Mr. Bush, speaking at the White House with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, said the United States \"will abide by the United Nations resolutions, of course,\" and he added, \"There are certain areas where Iraq, in order to comply with United Nations sanctions, must sell abroad.\" **********But the President added that, \"at this juncture, my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.\" **********Mr. Bush's statement came on a day when the Security Council passed a resolution formally setting up a procedure, yet to be activated, for processing damage claims against Iraq and docking future oil earnings to pay for them.

Mr. Major said Britain might veto any move in the Security Council to lift sanctions as long as Mr. Hussein is in power. **********Earlier in the day at the White House, Mr. Fitzwater referred reporters to a May 7 speech by the deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates. Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Gates's strong formulation on the sanctions question represented American policy. **********In the speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association, Mr. Gates, who has been nominated to be Director of Central Intelligence, said of Mr. Hussein, \"Iraqis will pay the price while he is in power.\" **********\"All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone,\" Mr. Gates continued. **********He said Iraq \"will be nothing but a pariah state\" as long as Mr. Hussein rules and that \"Iraqis will not participate in post-crisis political, economic and security arrangements until there is a change in regime.\" **********Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Gates's remarks at the publishers' meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, were \"extremely underreported\" but reflected a determination by the United States that, \"because of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait and the brutal repression of his own people, Saddam is discredited and cannot be redeemed.\" **********In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has repeatedly stated that the United States would not have normal relations with Iraq while Mr. Hussein was in power, but he has demurred on saying how he would treat requests by Iraq to sell oil for various urgent requirements. **********Kuwait's United Nations representative, Mohammed A. Abulhasan, said today that he had told the Security Council that his Government wanted Baghdad to pay up to 50 percent of its future revenue to settle compensation claims once the embargo is lifted. **********This would mean that as much as $10 billion of the $20 billion Iraq is expected to earn annually from selling oil at current prices would be available to meet damage claims, which Mr. Abulhasan estimated at around $60 billion. **********\"We favor a high level of payments because we want all claims paid within 10 years,\" he said, adding that Kuwait's claims are growing by $120 million a day to cover losses from the wells Iraqi troops set aflame. While Washington, like Kuwait, has spoken of fixing payments as high as 50 percent of Iraq's oil revenue, Britain, France and the Soviet Union -- all Council members with a veto -- expect a ceiling of 25 to 30 percent, with an actual first-year payment of about 25 percent. **********This means that Iraq would be required to hand over about $5 billion of its annual oil income, approximately what it was spending on foreign arms before the Persian Gulf war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/12/business/business-digest-744691.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Markets **********The stock market caught fire, scoring strong new gains in heavy trading and rising to its highest level since just before Iraq invaded Kuwait.

There were even a few predictions that Mr. Major might wait until the very last moment, July 11, 1992, before his first attempt at leading his party to national victory, after three straight successes under his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. **********He took over from her after a party leadership battle last November, when the Conservatives' fortunes were at a low point and it was trailing Labor by double-digit figures in the polls. **********The Conservative Party chairman, Chris Patten, said of the local elections today that \"it was not our night.\" With about 12,000 local council seats up for grabs, Conservatives, who had held 5,200 of them since 1987, lost well over 850, while Labor gained more than 450 and the Liberal Democrats, more than 500.

Labor politicians warned that the initiative would lead to cuts in the quality and availability of care at those hospitals and 54 others that had been allowed to opt out of the National Health Service. **********Today, Mr. Kinnock demanded an immediate general election, which he said he was sure Labor would win.

The rationale was that the Federal Reserve would be less inclined in the face of fresh evidence of inflationary pressure to take further steps to ease interest rates as a stimulus to the economy.  3.7% Rise in Benefits **********The report on the Consumer Price Index also means that nearly 50 million recipients of Social Security and other Federal benefits tied to inflation will get increases of 3.7 percent in January. This is the smallest adjustment in five years. It is the amount by which prices in the third quarter exceeded those a year earlier.  [ Page A10. ] **********But while the inflation figures captured much of the attention, a sizable proportion of economists found other indicators published today, particularly industrial output, of equal if not greater importance. Industrial production rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the Federal Reserve reported, and what was initially reported as a three-tenths of 1 percent advance for August was revised to zero. Although industrial production covers only about one-third of the economy, it is an important indicator because it reflects the part of the economy most sensitive to the business cycle. **********\"The recovery to date has been modest, and now it looks even more modest than we thought,\" said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. \"We have very little momentum going into the fourth quarter.\" **********Mr. Gramley, a former research chief and board member at the Fed, said that while there was no danger the economy would slip back into recession, the usual forces to sustain recovery were missing. He also said the data would seem to increase, not reduce, the chances for additional Fed rate-cutting. **********\"I'm a little puzzled about what it is they're waiting for,\" he said. **********At a briefing for reporters, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, said that the Fed \"may well have to consider further action\" if neither the economy nor the nation's money supply perk up. **********Figures on international trade published today for August showed the American deficit rising for the second straight month, to $6.8 billion, with exports down 3 percent. Exports, which have been relatively robust of late, are counted upon to help sustain the recovery, which most economists believe began during late spring or early summer. **********In still another report, the Labor Department said that initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 13,000 in the first week of October, to 423,000, but continued to rise a bit on the four-week moving average that many analysts use to smooth out gyrations. That average rose to a seasonally adjusted 432,500 from 427,000. **********Michael W. Keran, chief economist at the Prudential Insurance Company, joined Mr. Gramley in minimizing the significance of the inflation figures and contending that the Federal Reserve will pay more attention to the weak production results.  No Change in Outlook **********\"We don't think this represents a major change in our outlook about inflation,\" he said. In any event, Mr. Keran added, the Fed's long-run strategy may be to bring down inflation, \"but its short-run strategy is to not have recession.\" **********On the other hand, Paul W. Boltz and Norman Robertson, chief economists for T. Rowe Price Associates and the Mellon Bank, respectively, found the inflation data worrisome. **********\"This is an alert,\" Mr. Boltz said, that modest inflation is unlikely to continue into the new year. Noting the turnaround in food and energy prices, he said, \"They stopped helping -- and there it was.\" He also argued today that the recovery \"is on increasingly firm footing.\" **********Mr. Robertson said he was disturbed by both the inflation and output data, which reflect what he called a weak and hesitant economy and inflation so stubborn that it flares up in a protracted period of recession and sub-par growth. **********The report on consumer inflation came as such a surprise today in part because it followed a favorable reading last week on producer prices, which rose only one-tenth of a percent in September.  Rise Without Food and Energy **********Even without food and energy, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the fourth straight advance of this size. A leading contributor was a five-tenths of 1 percent jump in housing, which makes up 41 percent of the index and showed no price change in August. **********Both renters' costs and homeowners' costs rose five-tenths of 1 percent, more than offsetting a three-tenths of 1 percent decline for maintenance and repairs. The price of household fuels and utilities turned up, rising six-tenths of 1 percent over all, with fuel oil up 1.7 percent, natural gas up 1.4 percent electricity up seven-tenths of 1 percent. Household furnishings and operations rose two-tenths of 1 percent following a small decline in August. **********Food prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, but this followed two months of larger declines. Fresh fruits jumped 3.1 percent, dairy products advanced six-tenths of 1 percent and pork and fish prices also moved up. Prices for beef, poultry and eggs, however, fell. Surge in Motor Fuels **********In transportation, a two-tenths of 1 percent advance was mainly attributable to a nine-tenths of 1 percent surge in motor fuels. A drop in automobile finance charges held the costs of new cars to three-tenths of 1 percent and used-car prices fell. Public transportation dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting a 1.4 percent cut in airline fares. **********Clothing fell four-tenths of 1 percent following two large increases, the result of earlier-than-usual introductions of fall and winter wear. **********The cost of medical care continued to bound ahead, rising seven-tenths of 1 percent to a level 8.4 percent above that of September 1990. **********In the entertainment and other goods and services categories, prices of sporting goods, fees for participant sports, tuitions and other school fees and tobacco products all moved up by more than 1 percent last month. **********Viewed another way, services in the C.P.I. rose five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with three-tenths of 1 percent in August, while commodities rose two-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month. **********For the third quarter, prices rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, up from 3 percent in the second quarter and 2.4 percent in the first, a combined rate less than half the 6.6 percent pace during the first nine months of 1990. **********The the index covering all urban consumers now stands at 137.2.

The incident occurred near an army roadblock by the Sura district next to the main Palestinian quarter, Hawali. It is the only area of the city still regularly blocked off by army checkpoints. **********Dr. Mukhtar was shot twice in the back of the head, once in the neck and once in the chest, Kuwaiti police reports compiled that night at a nearby hospital said. His body bore a grazing wound from a bullet across the stomach that also struck his companion, a woman, in the leg. **********The woman and other witnesses said Dr. Mukhtar's car was pulled over by another car, possibly a white Mercedes with a blinking blue light, and three men got out and one opened fire with a pistol, according to investigators looking into the incident.  A Telltale Question **********\"Do you recognize me?\" the gunman reportedly asked before shooting, some accounts of the incident said. **********If true, the odd question is striking. The same question was said to have been posed to a prominent Kuwaiti leader of the opposition to Iraq's occupation, Hamad al-Jauan, seconds before a gunman shot him in the chest after knocking at his door in the first days after the Iraqi forces were ousted. Mr. Jauan was evacuated by American diplomats and military officials and is now reportedly being treated in a military hospital in the United States. **********At the time, many opposition members attributed the shooting to private militias loyal to some younger members of the ruling Sabah family who were described as intent on preserving the status quo. **********Palestinians here, numbering perhaps 400,000 and long established, had furnished many of the engineers, teachers, other professionals, bureaucrats and shopkeepers who built Kuwait's roads, schools, hospitals and other basic installations.  Palestinians Suffer for P.L.O. **********After the Iraqi occupation, some Kuwaitis took out their anger and frustration on the local Palestinians, whom they blamed for the Palestine Liberation Organization's support for Iraq and accused of collaborating with the occupation. **********Underground leaders have said that while some Palestinians worked with the Iraqis, many others helped them, providing food and other necessities. And Palestinians here were split over the official P.L.O. stand. **********American officials say they put considerable backstage pressure on leaders of the Kuwaiti Government, including the Crown Prince, Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, after initial reports of Palestinians being beaten at roadblocks and bodies turning up in hospital morgues, vacant lots and garbage dumps. **********The Kuwaitis were warned, the Americans said, that they should not be seen as acting like the Iraqi occupiers did. A human rights group, Middle East Watch, says that at least 30 people were killed, a report that Western diplomats say they find credible. **********United States Army officers working with the Kuwaitis say that despite their efforts, there are still cases of Kuwaiti soldiers or policemen pulling people from their homes and beating them; they say they are not sure how many Palestinians and others may be held captive, and they worry that trials for the 600 or so prisoners being charged with crimes during the occupation could turn into kangaroo courts. **********Kuwaiti officials have finally given American officers a list of 546 prisoners who are being held in what the Red Cross described as extremely overcrowded conditions in a military prison and who are to be transferred to civil authorities. **********But the Americans say they do not know how many people might be in other prisons, including Jiwan, which is run by the Kuwaiti National Guard, a force that guards the royal palaces and other major installations. Unlike the army and the police force, which were made up largely of Bedouins, the National Guard is composed of Kuwaiti citizens.  Responses, but No Solution **********\"The Kuwaiti Government is well aware that we're constantly pushing them on human rights,\" an American officer said today. \"We're consistently getting the right answers, but then this stuff keeps going on. You don't know whether it's incompetence and inefficiency, or that they're just telling us what we want to hear and waiting for us to go away, or some of both.\" **********Asked if he was worried that human rights abuses might occur once American forces left, the officer replied: **********\"Of course. I think the potential is clearly there.

William Seidman, the nation's senior banking regulator, said today that he had recommended that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation borrow $10 billion to avert the possible insolvency of the program that protects bank deposits and that the interest on the loan be paid by raising the annual contributions of banks by 18 percent. **********Mr. Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said that by borrowing the money rather than relying solely on bank contributions, the agency would be able to raise substantially more money. Neither he nor the Administration has said whether the money should be lent by the Government or the banks. **********The increase in the premium to be paid by the banks could take effect by June 30, he said. The increase would put the premium at 23 cents for every $100 in deposits, up from 19.5 cents.  Taking the First Step **********The board of the F.D.I.C. is expected to take the first step toward carrying out the premium increase on Thursday by seeking comment on a proposed rate increase, a move that in the past has invariably led to increases. **********The bank insurance fund, which protects deposits up to $100,000 per account, is having serious problems. The White House and the Congressional Budget Office have forecast that a growing number of failures of large banks could make the fund insolvent within two years. **********An insolvent bank insurance fund would raise the possibility of another costly taxpayer bailout to protect the insured deposits at the failed banks. The bailout of the savings and loan industry, approved in August 1989, is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.  A Steady Decline **********Payouts last year to depositors and to banks that agreed to buy failed institutions left the bank fund with $8.5 billion at the end of the year, down from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989. This year the fund is expected to post its fourth consecutive annual drop and its largest decrease since its creation in 1934. **********\"No one knows how much will ultimately be enough\" to insure the soundness of the fund, Mr. Seidman said in an impromptu meeting with reporters this afternoon after delivering a speech here to the annual conference of the Institute of International Bankers. \"What we believe is $10 billion ought to get us through this year even under the most adverse conditions.\" **********Although the refinancing of the bank insurance fund is widely considered to be the most pressing domestic financial issue confronting the Bush Administration, the Treasury Department has left it largely in the hands of the F.D.I.C.  Some Vague Guidelines **********Three weeks ago Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented a wide-ranging proposal to overhaul the banking laws, but it was vague on the topic of replenishing the fund, noting only that any solutions should be long term, should rely on industry money and should not injure the health of the banking system. **********The Treasury Department declined to comment on Mr. Seidman's proposal today, although Mr. Brady's views on the F.D.I.C. plan are expected to become known on Tuesday and Wednesday, when he appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees. **********An increase in premiums to 23 cents would be the second increase in six months and a 92 percent jump from the 12 cents that banks paid last year. The added cost will affect both customers and shareholders of the nation's 12,300 insured banks. For the first nine months of last year, the industry reported earnings of about 60 cents for every $100 in deposits. **********\"It's a tough increase and it will hurt, but the banking community has seen this coming for a long time,\" said Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. Deciding Where to Borrow **********Mr. Seidman said he had still not decided whether the $10 billion should be borrowed from banks, as a banking industry coalition has recommended, or from the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, or the Federal Financing Bank, which was established in 1973 to assist agencies whose obligations are guaranteed by the Government. The F.D.I.C. has the authority to raise premiums; certain new kinds of borrowing would require legislative approval. **********The industry group also recommended that premiums be capped at the current rate of 19.5 cents. Each increase of a cent for $100 in deposits raises about $250 million. The proposed increase of 3.5 cents would raise the banks' premiums to the 23-cent level already set for savings and loan associations. **********In an interview today, Mr. Seidman said he recommended the 15-year borrowing plan in a report sent on Friday evening to the Treasury Department as part of the first step in a two-part plan to raise cash. He declined to elaborate on the second part of the plan, but people who have been briefed on the proposal said it recommended that the F.D.I.C.'s authority to borrow from the Treasury be increased, a move that would require legislation.  Lines of Credit **********Under existing law, the F.D.I.C. has a credit line with the Treasury Department of $5 billion. It may also borrow money from the Federal Financing Bank or other sources based on a formula that relies on the net worth of the fund. Under the formula, and based on the present condition of the fund, the F.D.I.C. can now borrow $65 billion, but that would be reduced as the fund's net worth declines. **********Mr. Seidman said a statistical analysis by the F.D.I.C. had concluded that an increase in premiums would not produce \"a significant amount\" of additional bank failures. **********Mr. Seidman conceded that the increase in bank premiums would \"obviously have some effect on the credit crunch,\" making less money available for lending in certain markets where credit is already tight. \"The greatest worry is that we don't do anything to substantially increase the credit crunch,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/23/world/war-gulf-reporter-s-notebook-hueys-scuds-vietnam-gulf-are-wars-apart.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Technology for pilots, enabling them to skim the ground, juke to avoid ack-ack and perform other jazzy maneuvers, all at night or in the clouds. Technology that guides cruise missiles so precisely that one fired from a battleship in the Persian Gulf clipped a communications tower in Baghdad neatly in two, according to witnesses in the Iraqi capital. **********Technology that makes this a real-time war, with a speech by Saddam Hussein or a briefing at the Pentagon or even a Scud vs. Patriot duel over Saudi Arabia visible in Baghdad and Washington and London at the same time. Technology that links reporters in Dhahran instantly with editors in New York or Los Angeles, commanders and staff officers in Riyadh continuously with the Pentagon and the White House. The Upper Hand in the Dark **********Pilots in Vietnam could do little more than find their way from one airstrip to another after sunset, worrying all the while about running into a mountain. For the most part, the enemy owned the night. **********This time, if the new-fangled scopes and gadgets work as they're supposed to work -- and that's still a large \"if,\" though early evidence is highly encouraging -- allied infantrymen and tank crews will have the upper hand in the dark, as the allied pilots already do. **********Comparing the endearing little UH-1 Huey helicopter, which saved so many lives and seemed like such a piece of technical wizardry, to the fearsome Apache attack helicopters here is like comparing a Model T to a Lamborghini. Sunspots to Glitches **********Only 25 years ago, well within the working lifetimes of many of the combatants and some of the correspondents in the war in the Persian Gulf, reporters sent their dispatches from Vietnam by radio telegraph, which was sometimes interrupted by sunspots, and television cameramen had to ship combat footage to Hong Kong or Tokyo, and then on to the United States, by plane. **********A newspaper reporter who spent almost three years in Saigon talked more times to his editors on his first day in Saudi Arabia than he did in the entire time he was in Vietnam. Stories are written on computers now, of course, and not on typewriters, and they are transmitted by satellite. **********There are problems with all of this, of course. Greater and greater complexity means more and more glitches and more and more repairs. Modems and lasers are a lot more temperamental than notebooks and hand grenades. **********Then there is the tendency to believe, after a time, that the machines are somehow magical and final, when of course they are not. **********A runway cratered or a bridge dropped or a transmitter damaged by a sophisticated missile is no more and no less replaceable or reparable than a similar target damaged by an old iron bomb. **********Finally, the effect of the communications revolution is to speed things up so much that time for decision-making is minimized and time for reflection is often eliminated. In With the New **********But the lasers and the heat seekers, the computers and the satellites, are here to stay, along with a new whole lexicon of slang and acronyms. **********For example, Lantirn, which stands for Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting for Infrared Night, is an advanced guidance system, carried in pods slung under the wings of some F-16 fighters, that enables pilots to deliver bombs with great precision. Then there is the SLAM, or Stand-off Land Attack Missile, launched from a carrier-based attack plane. **********A few Vietnam-era favorites are back -- infantrymen and Marines still call themselves \"grunts\" -- but instead of \"boondocks,\" privates and sergeants tramp hereabouts across \"beaches\" (deserts) and wadis (dry river beds). Pilots talk about \"fur balls,\" or particularly tangled dogfights, and about \"the golden BB,\" which is the antiaircraft doctrine, supposedly Soviet in origin, holding that if enough metal of some kind is thrown up -- missiles, shells, bullets -- planes will come down. **********To some sentimental old soldiers and camp followers, one big loss is the World War II-era United States Army helmet, a fine, deep sort of thing, as useful for shaving and cooking as for deflecting bullets. It has been discarded for a flatter model that looks as if Rommel ought to be wearing it. Also sorely missed is the Jeep, replaced by something the grunts call the Humvee, which carries more. It's less fun to drive and looks like a panel truck that something fell on. **********The M-16 rifle is back, no great favorite two decades ago, so a new generation will discover whether it works better in the sand of Arabia than it did in the paddies of Vietnam. **********A hundred stories and a thousand pictures have testified already to the presence of women in the ranks in unprecedented numbers, but there has been less comment about another major change: the much larger numbers of black officers involved here, starting at the top with Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and spreading down through the ranks. **********Col. Daniel James, an air ace in Vietnam, was one of relatively few black pilots then. Black naval officers were even more unusual. That has all changed, a result, like the presence of so many women so close to the front, of the social revolution that followed and was partly caused by the Vietnam War. Evolution of Shopping **********For all the veterans of Vietnam brought here by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, another stunning surprise is the local stores. **********Except for those with access to an American commissary or post exchange, Americans in wartime Saigon had to do without things like milk, celery, tape recordings, and a hundred other items. A pint of strawberries, lovingly hand-carried from Da Lat or another town in the highlands on an Air America flight, was a gift as exotic as frankincense or myrrh. **********Shopping in Dhahran is not all that different from shopping in Larchmont, N.Y., or Phoenix. Radio Shack is here (though the troops have pretty well cleared out its stock for the moment), as is Baskin-Robbins. **********You can pick up a shirt or a skirt at Benetton, rent a Chevrolet from Avis, buy a new Volvo or Fiat. Commerce has slowed since war began, but it hasn't stalled. **********At the Jamir Bookstore today, three airborne troopers of the new breed were buying reams of computer paper. Around the corner, a selection of compact-disk players was for sale. And the Safeway in nearby Al Khobar -- yes, that Safeway, the one with the big red \"S\" -- was featuring, in addition to eight brands of mayonnaise, 12 brands of hairspray, Weber barbecue grills and 30-minute film processing, Roquefort and Brie and Gruyere from France, Gulf of Mexico shrimp, Holland veal, Irish lamb and Australian beef. **********But no wine, of course, no beer, no gin and no whiskey, and no nuoc mam, the pungent Vietnamese fish sauce that so many Americans grew to love in their Southeast Asian years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/business/no-more-aid-for-mba-s-in-china.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1991-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No More Aid for M.B.A.'s in China", "print_headline": "No More Aid for M.B.A.'s in China", "body_text": " **********In a modest structure on the leafy campus of the Dalian University of Technology, just across from a huge statue of Chairman Mao leading his Communist flock, capitalism is the burning issue. **********The Chinese at the school, who are not trying to outflank Communism's nemesis but to absorb more of it, are losing some ground. Despite Chinese protests, the Commerce Department has refused to renew an annual $400,000 contribution to a business school program here that has turned scores of young Chinese managers into freshly minted M.B.A.'s for service in their homeland. **********The 11-year-old program was unique: a Government-to-Government arrangement, financed partly by each country, that offered management courses to officials from many of China's top enterprises. **********It provided regular American M.B.A. degrees, under a program run by the State University of New York at Buffalo, which provided the curriculum and professors. The program at this campus in Dalian, a port city in China's industrial northeast, the region once known as Manchuria, also took senior Chinese officials and offered them midcareer training in American management techniques. **********And the professors did not train the Chinese to work just in foreign ventures, as the management courses of some other countries in China do. The majority of the Dalian program's graduates returned to their state-owned enterprises, introducing American methods directly into the heart of Communist China. **********But the Commerce Department's decision to stop supporting this program is a sign of the times inside China and in Sino-American relations. **********The United States' decision to pull the plug on the M.B.A. program reflects the political realities as the American love affair with China continues the cooling-off that started with the killings of pro-democracy demonstrators two years ago in Tiananmen Square. **********President Bush is currently struggling to renew China's favored access to American markets. An antagonistic Congress that has lost patience with what it considers China's poor human rights record voted Tuesday to impose restrictions on trade between the countries but the narrow majority is not likely to withstand a veto. **********The shift in Washington is occurring as the Chinese have expanded foreign trade and encouraged foreign companies to invest in private businesses. The M.B.A. students here speak English as their second language, and use it to debate finance, marketing and labor management strategies, not class warfare. **********Even with the setbacks that Western-style reform has suffered for three years, China remains eager to learn what it must to advance its hobbling economy and integrate it more closely with the industrialized democracies. **********Ultimately, though, the decision to halt the program here raises the question of which measures taken by an angry United States against China really punish the country or soften its behavior, and which merely undermine the United States' goal of achieving political and economic reform. **********\"We admit we have a lot of problems trying to reform our system,\" said Zhu Shunqing, an economist who is the dean of the university's school of management. \"The graduates of this school have new ideas, and they understand the thinking of foreigners. What we have to have is useful knowledge to help with the reform process, even from capitalists.\" **********Like the dean of a Harvard or a Stanford, Mr. Zhu proudly ticked off the important government offices and corporations in which the graduates of the American program have landed, from the State Planning Commission and top provincial offices to some of China's largest state enterprises. President Ronald Reagan praised the program during a visit to China in 1984 and Henry Kissinger spoke at one of its graduations. **********That record of success has only increased the dismay over the Commerce Department's decision to kill the program. The department has decided that it can spend the $400,000 a year it contributes to better effect elsewhere, perhaps in Eastern Europe. **********\"This is painful for me because I started the program 11 years ago,\" said Richard W. H. Lee, the Commerce Department's director of science and technology programs in East Asia. \"Everyone considers it a great success, but it is a matter of priorities. The department's priorities have changed.\"   'The Wrong Information' **********Mr. Zhu, too, acknowledged the apparent shift in priorities. \"The Department of Commerce said they wanted to change their emphasis from China to Eastern Europe,\" he said. \"They said they didn't think we would reform our economy. I say they have the wrong information.\" **********Many who have been involved in the program concede it had shortcomings; some of the young M.B.A.s found there was little use for their new skills in hidebound state-owned enterprises, for instance. **********Mr. Zhu said some graduates were frustrated when they returned to a Chinese environment. Some were relegated to jobs as translators without real influence. But he said those problems were declining because the students were being chosen with more care. **********But almost all felt that the positive aspects outweighed those flaws, and that the good will it generated for the United States was important.  Better Business Relations **********\"It's a tragedy,\" said Joseph A. Alutto, the dean of Buffalo's business school until earlier this year, when he moved to Ohio State University. \"You could not find a more cost-effective way of developing better business relations. And the need for this expertise and these relationships has never been greater.\" **********Added David B. Matthews, the resident administrator of the program for the State University of New York: \"We really do have an impact on the senior level of managers in the Chinese economy. If you close it down you lose that.\" **********Although Commerce Department officials prefer to say the annual grant is just being suspended, the program's administrators say the likelihood of reviving it is slim because of the long lead time to attract students and professors. **********The American Government has encouraged American corporations to consider picking up the program's decidedly modest cost. There is already an advisory counsel made up of some of America's biggest companies, including I.B.M., Xerox, Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola. The companies have provided internships for the Chinese students and other forms of backing.  Where Government Has Clout **********But most agree the corporations could never replace the Government as chief sponsor. The fact that the course was Government-to-Government gave it clout in a country where the Government so tightly controls the economy. If it were a corporate program it would lose that important status, and possibly the backing of the Chinese Government, Mr. Zhu said. **********\"Part of the whole reason this has been so successful is the kind of students it draws, and that's because it's Government to Government,\" Mr. Lee said. **********Mr. Zhu said: \"China has really opened to these ideas. It is not a good choice for you to close that door.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/25/business/money-market-accounts-and-cd-s-drop-in-yield.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Market Accounts And C.D.'s Drop in Yield", "print_headline": "Money Market Accounts And C.D.'s Drop in Yield", "body_text": " **********Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts showed further declines in the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., that focuses on interest rates. **********Robert K.

Mr. von Hayek's views on the economic inadequacies and political ills of central planning are now those of the mainstream. Yesterday, President Bush awarded the 92-year old Mr. von Hayek, a British citizen, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. **********\"More than almost anyone else in the 20th century, this guy was vindicated by the events in Eastern Europe,\" said Austin Furse, director of policy planning at the White House. Mr. von Hayek has a wide following among Eastern European economic reformers, he noted, including Vaclav Klaus, the Finance Minister of Czechoslovakia. **********Once described as \"articulate, austere and infinitely urbane,\" Mr. von Hayek was born in 1899 into a Viennese family of academics and civil servants. He eventually left for the London School of Economics, where he lectured throughout the 1930's and 40's. When Keynesian thought triumphed and his own reputation as an economist went into eclipse, Mr. von Hayek turned to philosophy and psychology, which he first taught at the University of Chicago, then in Salzburg, Austria, and finally in Freiburg, Germany. **********Conservatives have been urging President Bush, who picks the Medal of Freedom winners himself, to honor Mr. von Hayek. The Nobel laureate's son, a British physician, was on hand at the ceremony yesteray to accept the medal on behalf of his father, who lives in Freiburg and has been ill for several years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/business/all-aboutcomic-books-reaching-beyond-the-ghouls-and-gore-for-major.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-02-17", "snippet": "For years, Spider-Man, Superman and other comic book stars were entertainment industry weaklings.

Movie, television and video-game characters drew more attention. But now the superheroes are back in all their glory. Comic book sales are up and publishers are churning out new titles to feed a growing market. **********In the clearest sign of the comic book's return to prominence, media giants like Disney, MCA and Time Warner all are investing more. While most comic books only fetch $1 to $2 an issue, the media companies hope for big payoffs from finding memorable characters to feature in theme parks and films, and to decorate T-shirts and lunch boxes. **********Two sorts of superheroes have led the industry's revival. Batman starred in an immensely successful film, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, pizza-eating swashbucklers, rose from the pages of an obscure comic book to appear in a movie, a television series and a stage show. Comic book publishing executives say that such successes have attracted fans to newer books like Lobo -- DC Comics Inc.'s \"scourge of the cosmos\" -- and the Punisher, Marvel Entertainment Group Inc.'s well-armed vigilante. **********As the industry has grown, marketing has become more expensive and sophisticated.  DC Comics is testing television advertising, which most publishers have shunned. Marvel is bringing out new titles -- Barbie, to attract girls. and N.F.L. Superpro, about a superhuman athlete -- to take the market beyond the young males craving ghouls and gore. **********Comic book retailers are also entering a new era, opening clean, brightly lit stores in shopping malls and on main streets. Bill Liebowitz, who owns the three Golden Apple comics shops in Los Angeles, said that the industry merits much greater respect. \"The general public's perception of comics has been that they are read by little kids and cretins, and that the stores are located in bad parts of town and run by guys who can't get a date,\" he said. \"That's just not true. Comics are increasing in quality and complexity. We're an entertainment alternative.\" Changing MarketsThe Yen for What The 40's Had **********The comic book industry has doubled its sales at specialty stores in five years, to $350 million, according to Melchior T. Thompson, a consultant in Burlingame, Calif. He estimates that the nation's 4,000 specialty shops account for 65 percent to 85 percent of comic book sales. Newsstands and other stores have the rest. **********Comic book industry executives say that sales are growing 10 percent to 20 percent annually. But they still envy the multibillion-dollar annual sales of the movies and video games that use similar adventure themes. **********When executives talk about the potential of comic books, they point to other countries. The Walt Disney comic book Topolino, with varying Disney characters each week, is thethird-largest Italian magazine, with weekly sales of about 650,000 copies. In Japan, adults read comics ranging from the violent to the romantic. **********\"We see room for a quintupling of our current market size,\" said Milton Griepp, president of Capital City Distribution Inc., the nation's second-largest distributor of comic books (after Diamond Comic Distributors) to specialty shops. **********If he is right, comic books will regain the popularity they had in the 1930's and 1940's, before parents and politicians attacked many comic books for corrupting children with their violent tales. By the 1970's, the books had disappeared from many newsstands. **********About 15 years ago, publishers decided to concentrate on their most loyal buyers, who patronized a small group of specialty shops. Distributors offered much deeper discounts to the shops than to the newsstands. In return, the shops forfeited the right to return unsold comics to the publishers, a privilege that the newsstands retained. **********The new sales method, known as direct distribution, rescued the industry. Costly returns were reduced. And many small, independent publishers could afford to enter the market. New publishers could pitch comic book ideas to retailers through distributors. Distributors could size up the likely orders before publishers had invested in production. **********As a result, new comics have proliferated. Where comic stores once carried 70 or 80 titles, they now offer as many as 500. Niche marketing is common. \"With 500 titles, you not only have the standard superhero books but also books about female spies and cowboys,\" said Mr. Liebowitz. The Big MoneyPerelman, MCA And Time Warner **********Among the nation's nearly 200 comic book publishers, the biggest are backed by the biggest money. Marvel, owned by the financier Ronald O. Perelman since January 1989, had 46.1 percent of the comic book store business handled by Capital City Distributors. DC Comics, a subsidiary of the Time Warner Company, had 28.6 percent. No reliable figures for the entire market are available, but Capital City's numbers are considered representative. **********Other major entertainment companies are buying in. Last year, MCA Inc. spent a reported $7 million to $10 million to buy almost 20 percent of Harvey Comics Entertainment Inc., the 50-year-old publisher of Casper the Friendly Ghost and Richie Rich. MCA, which has agreed to be acquired by Matsushita of Japan.  MCA plans to keep its comic book characters working hard. The Harvey's investment included agreements for them to appear at MCA theme parks, perhaps in stage shows or rides, and in films and television programs. Harvey also plans to launch a comic book based on MCA's \"Back to the Future\" films. **********Entertainment industry executives add that MCA's Universal Pictures, or another studio, might make a film featuring Harvey's Richie Rich. A possible star, they say, is Macaulay Culkin, the child star of the movie \"Home Alone.\" Jeffrey Montgomery, Harvey's chairman, said his company will continue developing new characters that then might star in films. \"Comic books are a great breeding ground,\" Mr. Montgomery said. \"To launch a comic book costs less than $50,000. If it hits, it's worth billions.\" **********In late 1989, the Walt Disney Company reacquired from a licensee the rights to publish its own characters -- Mickey, Minnie and the rest -- in comic books. Disney is ready to produce a new line of comics under the Hollywood imprint, targeting the core comic book audience of teen-age and young adult males. **********Disney will test its ability to cross-pollinate between films and comics this summer with the release of a big-budget film and tie-in comic book called the Rocketeer, about a stunt pilot who flies with a rocket pack. The Packaging From Archie To Spidey to Anne **********The Flash may have his own television show and Batman his own movie. But the current best seller among comic books concerns an uptight photojournalist named Peter Parker and his heroic alter identity: Spider-Man.  Marvel Comics now sells five different Spider-Man books a month with titles like the Amazing Spider-Man and the Web of Spider-Man. In an age when a famous comic book artist can achieve almost as much reknown as an actor, it is Todd McFarlane, who was asked to create a new Spidey book last summer, who has the best seller.  Mr. McFarlane's Spider-Man sells 800,000 to 1 million a month, according to Marvel, in an industry where 400,000 is huge. The premiere issue sold almost 3 million, many to speculators. **********Comic book aficionados link Spider-Man's appeal to his everyman qualities. True, he stands apart by virtue of the radioactive spider bite that gave him the strength and agility of a giant arachnid. Otherwise, Peter Parker is a doting new husband who struggles like everyone else to make ends meet. **********Archie Comic Publications Inc., meanwhile, is among those planning to keep its best-known character as clean cut and uncommitted as ever. Archie, 50 years old this year, is perpetually involved in what Michael I. Silberkleit, the company chairman, calls \"the basic love triangle: He's in love with two beautiful girls. People read to see which girl he'll marry. Of course he won't marry either one.\" **********Other small companies pursue constant new faces, some, like Barbie, aimed at preteens, but most still the brutally tough crime fighters and appalling villains. **********There are more elaborate comics based on familiar themes. First Publishing's Classics Illustrated tales include versions of \"Robin Hood\" and \"Great Expectations.\" Other publishers mine action and horror films for ideas. Last summer, the publisher Dark Horse hit it big by combining characters from two recent movies in one issue, Aliens Vs. Predators. **********For more sophisticated tastes, there are \"graphic novels\" -- longer stories with more complex characters and glossy, durable covers -- that can cost $15 to $25.  DC's Why I Hate Saturn, out last year, tells the story of Anne, a trendy intellectual writer in New York, who drinks too much and has trouble with men. Betty or Veronica she is not. **********WHO WANTS BACK ISSUES? **********Own a pristine copy of the first issue of Action Comics? It could more than cover the downpayment on your next house. **********The 1938 comic book, in which Superman first appears, is one of several estimated to be worth $80,000 to $100,000. Pre-World War II comics gain not only for the venerable characters they include but also because so many issues were destroyed during the war's scrap paper drives.  But even recent issues, like the first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, published in 1982, are worth several hundred dollars. The collectible market is substantial, supporting scores of annual comic book shows. **********Collecting fever begins at the comic book shops, where children, the most devoted fans, congregate. Shop owners often raise prices for selected back issues they keep on hand. **********Not all back issues become more valuable; stockpiling comics is a speculative business. Gary Colabuono, who operates six Moondog's Comicland shops in the Chicago area, said that since last summer, with the onset of recession and war, prices for the more expensive comics have leveled off. **********Don Thompson, co-editor of the weekly Comics Buyer's Guide, said that collecting -- as opposed to speculating -- is routine among comic fans. The books are serialized; one issue almost never tells a whole story. So old fans want entire collections, and new fans often want old issues to learn more about the origins of a particular character or story line. **********Collecting can be expensive. To buy every comic published in one month would cost $1,200 to $1,500. Fanatics routinely invest $100 to $400 a month in their hobby. \"There are people who live in sparse apartments, living on baloney sandwiches, who spend every spare penny they can on collecting,\" Mr. Thompson said. \"Where they store them I don't know.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/06/world/soviet-turmoil-soviet-congress-yields-rule-republics-avoid-political-economic.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1991-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET CONGRESS YIELDS RULE TO REPUBLICS TO AVOID POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE", "print_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL; SOVIET CONGRESS YIELDS RULE TO REPUBLICS TO AVOID POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE", "body_text": " **********Bowing to the reality of a collapsing union and an ultimatum from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the all-Soviet Congress voted today to surrender power to a new government largely controlled by the republics. **********The action served largely to confirm the collapse of central authority over the 15 constituent republics in the 16 days since the aborted right-wing coup and the increasingly urgent need to restore at least a modicum of order before the centrifugal forces turned uncontrollable. **********The major effect of the new central structures approved by the Congress of People's Deputies was to grant sweeping emergency powers for an undefined transitional period to a State Council composed of Mr. Gorbachev and leaders of the participating republics, backed by a largely subordinate legislature and a central Interrepublican Economic Committee to manage the economy.  [ Text of resolutions and excerpts from Mr. Gorbachev's remarks, page A12. ] Gorbachev the Manager **********In so doing, the Congress effectively dissolved itself as the highest legislative authority in the Soviet Union and laid the foundation for a far looser union in which the republics would seem to predominate in deciding the policies and powers of a subordinate and reduced center. A major question remains the extent of Mr. Gorbachev's remaining power and influence. Although his powers seem sharply diminished, it is possible that he might emerge with important powers in the new State Council, particularly if the republican leaders pay more attention to their problems at home. **********Under a rough timetable worked out today, the new two-house legislature will convene no later than Oct. 2, and will probably set up a commission to draft a new constitution. It is expected that the new constitution will provide for new elections to the presidency at some future date, at which time Mr. Gorbachev's political future would be decided.  'Rose to the Occasion' **********Mr. Gorbachev, who survived the coup only to stand on the brink of losing any viable levers of control, emerged in the interim order with considerably clipped powers and subordinate to the republics, less an executive president than a coordinating manager. **********Yet the very fact of his survival, his experience in domestic and foreign affairs and the familiar determination he displayed at the Congress suggested that he could emerge with a significant role in the new council. Most republic leaders had problems enough at home, and Mr. Gorbachev was likely to be the major conduit for foreign aid. **********Whatever the reason, his obvious good humor at the Congress testified to his satisfaction at what he described as a historic moment. **********\"By determining the principles and mechanisms for the transitional period, the Congress lays the groundwork for a future union of sovereign states,\" he said before closing the session. \"The Congress rose to the occasion at this crucial and, without any exaggeration, historic moment in the development of our state.\" **********For the moment, the arrangement was less a power-sharing agreement than a desperate attempt to create an emergency control center that could combat the incipient chaos and ethnic strife loosed by the coup, prevent the collapse of the economy and the fragmentation of the military.  Principles for the Future **********The law made no attempt to define the scope, functions or procedures of the new State Council, leaving that to the republican leaders and Mr. Gorbachev to sort out. It was unclear how the republican leaders would be represented in the council and how often the council would meet, whether Mr. Gorbachev, more attuned to Moscow, might rule between meetings with the Russian leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, or would have to check his every action with republican representatives. **********The Congress did, however, pass a nonbinding resolution outlining broad principles for the future, pledging to honor existing Soviet agreements with other states and charging the State Council with \"insuring the legal continuity of power and management, guaranteeing a peaceful and orderly transition to a democratic civil society.\" **********The State Council was to hold its first meeting Friday, when it was likely to appoint the Economic Committee -- in effect an acting cabinet -- and consider emergency economic programs. There were reports that Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the prime advocate of radical economic reform, was readying a preliminary economic plan. **********The council was also expected to recognize the independence of the three Baltic states, an issue the Congress avoided taking up for fear of prompting demands by other republics for similar recognition. The Baltics are the only states whose independence has received broad recognition abroad, and while most other republics have also proclaimed independence, all except Moldavia might yet form some new form of association. **********The new Government was declared a transitional authority until those republics that wanted to could agree on a new relationship, still undefined. The law set no time limits, and deputies talked vaguely of a transitional period of two months to two years. **********Besides Mr. Gorbachev, it was also a satisfying moment for those who had struggled for years against a monolithic and repressive system that had held their nation in thrall for seven decades, and who viewed the vote as its final burial. **********The eulogy was proposed by Anatoly A. Sobchak, the liberal mayor of Leningrad: \"I propose a fitting conclusion to our work by fulfilling the last will of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and burying him according to the religious and national traditions of our people at Volkovo Cemetery with all appropriate honors.\"  Gorbachev Turns Tough **********Lenin had in fact asked to be buried next to his mother and sister in the Leningrad cemetery, but the proposal was quashed by Mr. Gorbachev. **********The end did not come easily. For two days the debate at the Congress ranged from bitter resistance against the surrender of power to somber acknowledgment that the old order was out. **********At today's session, however, Mr. Gorbachev turned tough. Flanked by Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of nine other republics, the man who six years earlier first loosed the democratic processes that created this Congress now sternly demanded that it fulfill its purpose by clearing the way for the new era. **********Turning away all speakers, demanding silence and obedience in the vast Palace of Congresses, Mr. Gorbachev martialed vote after vote until the deputies balked on a critical paragraph. Twice they denied it a two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional change, when Mr. Gorbachev declared an ultimatum: \"We've been talking for three days and we must move foward. Either take this decision and continue on the path, or we will seek new answers.\" **********He did not elaborate, but the glare of the republic leaders made clear that they were the new law in the land with or without the endorsement of Congress. This time, by a margin of scores of votes, it passed -- 1,606 for, 116 against, 83 abstaining and 37 not voting. **********Critical to the passage was the decision by Estonia and Latvia, despite their independence, to have their deputies take part in the vote. Lithuania withdrew its deputies from the outset. **********The rest went easily, and by the time the Congress was called on to vote on a Declaration of Human Rights, no one even asked to speak. The declaration, which includes guarantees of free movement, is nonbinding. **********The central action taken by the congress, the law on transferring power, was in part a compromise. The original proposal from the republican leaders had called for a largely nominal legislature appointed by the republics. 2-Chamber Parliament **********The final version created a two-chamber Parliament with a Council of the Republics and a Council of the Union. **********The Council of the Republics would have 20 deputies from each republic except Russia, which would have additional deputies from ethnic subrepublics for a total of 52. The catch, however, was that each republicwould have only one vote in the Council of the Republics. **********In the Council of the Union, seats would be apportioned by quota. Its action would be subject to approval by the Council of the Republics. **********The law also lifted a requirement for the Congress to formally dissolve itself. Deputies were allowed to retain their credentials until the end of their term in two and a half years, along with their privileges and immunity, but regular assemblies were canceled. **********Substantive powers were granted to the State Council, which was authorized to organize its own work and whose decisions were declared binding. The law said nothing about the relationship between the council and the Parliament, empowering the council in effect to rule by decree. **********The law called for an Interrepublican Economic Committee to be named by the republics. All national military, security and foreign-affairs institutions were placed under the control of the council. **********The resolution passed by the Congress gave a broad, though nonbinding outline of thenew Government's goals. **********It charged the new leaders with \"insuring the legal continuity of power and management, guaranteeing a peaceful and orderly transition to a democratic civil society,\" and it called for accelerated efforts to negotiate a new Union Treaty \"in which each state can independently define the form of its participation in the Union.\" **********The resolution called on republics to reach agreements among themselves on a variety of economic, fiscal, military and other issues. It pledged to honor all Soviet international agreements, and called for negotiated agreements with republics that wanted to leave the union. **********While the Congress met, events across the land underscored the urgency of restoring order. Railroad lines in Moldavia remained blocked by women demanding the release of leaders of the \"Dnestr Republic,\" an enclave largely populated by Russians and Ukrainians that opposes Moldavian independence. **********A new wave of violence was reported in South Ossetia, a region that demands independence of Georgia, and in Georgia tensions were high after the police fired on demonstrators opposed to the authoritarian President, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Armenia and Azerbaijan squared off for new confrontations over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and rumblings were reported in several ethnic regions of the Russian Federation. **********Yet the documents adopted today marked a turning point in the tumult that swept over the Soviet Union with the collapse of the coup and the subsequent eruption of nationalist and republican claims. The same republican leaders who had rushed to declare independence now sat alongside Mr. Gorbachev and argued the need for maintaining a center, and the deputies who had defended or attacked the old order now mustered the dignity to surrender their own hard-won authority in the name of a new order. **********At the center stood Mr. Gorbachev, still self-confident and assertive, a man who had come within a hair's-breadth of being swept away by the same processes he had set loose six years earlier, but who had clambered back to center stage by dint of his fundamental faith in the union's potential for renewal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/21/business/us-inquiry-on-mini-vans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Inquiry on Mini-Vans", "print_headline": "U.S. Inquiry on Mini-Vans", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department today began investigating charges by American auto makers that Japanese companies were \"dumping\" mini-vans in the United States at prices below cost to increase their market share. **********The inquiry was sought three weeks ago by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler through the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. **********The International Trade Commission is expected to take testimony on Friday from officials of the Big Three and the Japanese auto makers. **********The American auto makers contend that the Japanese auto makers -- Toyota and Mazda in particular -- are selling mini-vans at prices below their production costs. **********Toyota has called the Big Three's accusations absurd. **********Through the first five months of the year, the Big Three held 86.1 percent of the mini-van market, with Japanese makers holding 13.2 percent. **********The complaint said Toyota was selling its Previa mini-van to dealers at 5.4 percent to 30.5 percent below fair value.

In the series, created by Eddie Murphy Productions for Paramount Television, Mr. Foxx and Della Reese play parents who find their imminent retirement interrupted when their daughter and grandchildren move in. **********Since it is unusual for a leading actor to die during a series, there are no formal procedures to deal with Mr. Foxx's death. **********\"It's a terribly unfortunate situation,\" said Paul Schulman, president of the Paul Schulman Company in New York. He purchases $175 million worth of commercial time annually and had bought spots during \"The Royal Family\" for a client, the Ralston Purina Company. **********Before the 1991-92 television season started, advertising executives had expected that \"The Royal Family\" would be a successful new series at 8 P.M., Eastern time, on Wednesdays. This summer, during the advance, or up-front, market, they bet on its potential drawing power by committing clients to purchases that, according to Advertising Age, averaged $80,000 for each 30-second spot. **********Those spots were part of guaranteed packages the executives bought from the networks. For example, while CBS does not guarantee Mr. Schulman that a spot during \"The Royal Family\" would attract a certain number of viewers, the network would guarantee him that figure for a package of 100 spots during its Wednesday lineup. **********\"It becomes a question of whether Redd Foxx's absence causes the show to perform less well than the guarantee,\" said Joseph Ostrow, corporate executive vice president and worldwide media director for FCB/ Leber Katz Partners in New York. If it does, he added, \"then you get compensatory spots,\" or make-goods, for the rest of the season. **********CBS thought \"The Royal Family\" had \"breakthrough potential,\" -- the chance to become a huge hit, thereby improving the network's previously anemic Wednesday ratings. **********The series had yet to achieve hit status, according to David Marans, senior vice president for media research at J. Walter Thompson in New York. Yet ratings for its four appearances before Mr. Foxx's death -- it was 51st among 99 series measured in the A. C. Nielsen ratings -- were higher than for any recent CBS Wednesday lead-off series. **********At CBS, \"The consensus is we'd like the show to continue,\" said George F. Schweitzer, senior vice president of marketing and communications, adding that meetings are being held to discuss \"where it goes from here.\" **********The next step for advertisers is to wait as CBS \"tap-dances for a while,\" said Aaron Cohen, senior vice president and director of network broadcasting at Ayer Inc. in New York, \"and to encourage them to do the best they can.\" **********The executives' position is bolstered \"by the fact we can take our money back\" if CBS cancels \"The Royal Family,\" said Jon Mandel, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, who had purchased spots during the series for clients including Domino's Pizza and Mitsubishi. **********CBS is studying the possibilities. Mr. Schulman suggested \"replacing Red Foxx with a major name,\" like the actor Sherman Hemsley, star of the comedies \"Amen\" and \"The Jeffersons.\" **********\"We hope that will work,\" Mr. Schulman said. \"If it doesn't, we won't be terribly depressed. Our biggest sponsorship on NBC is on 'Unsolved Mysteries' -- which runs opposite \"The Royal Family.\" **********In the meantime, Mr. Schweitzer said, CBS will pre-empt \"The Royal Family\" twice before it returns on Oct. 30. Tonight, it will be replaced by \"Teech,\" a comedy that normally follows \"The Royal Family\" at 8:30, and a week from tonight, by a World Series pre-game show. **********Viewers with long memories offered CBS solace by citing television history. In 1960, when the actor Ward Bond died, his NBC series, \"Wagon Train,\" was second in the ratings. After he was replaced, by the actor John McIntire, it rose to No. 1 during the 1961-62 season."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/13/business/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-pc.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1991-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Keeping Up With the Joneses' PC", "print_headline": "Keeping Up With the Joneses' PC", "body_text": " **********In a move that speaks volumes about the changing computer industry, I.B.M. recently began letting consumers trade in their old personal computers for a discount on a new one. **********Thus is the personal computer business becoming akin to selling automobiles. Like the car, the personal computer is turning into a replacement product, because many businesses and homes that are most likely to use computers already have them. After a decade of rapid growth from selling computers to new users, companies big and small are increasingly reliant on selling replacement machines or improved versions of software. **********\"In the 90's, every buyer of a computer has a computer,\" said Alex Randall, president of the Boston Computer Exchange, a broker for used computers. \"You can't sell a better computer to a person that has an adequate one without displacing the adequate one.\" **********The shift is having a profound effect on many aspects of the business. **********Advertising is no longer full of such devices as the Charlie Chaplin figure used by the International Business Machines Corporation to make computers friendlier to novices. Now ads from established companies like Compaq and smaller upstarts like Dell Computer emphasize megabytes, megahertz -- and price. **********Hardware companies like the Tandon Corporation and AST Research Inc., are making their computers easy to upgrade as a way to capture more business. **********Software companies, too, are finding that sales opportunities increasingly lie not among new users but in raiding their competitors' clientele while offering upgrades to their own customers. The redesigns make the programs more powerful, easier to use or just better looking, with pretty typefaces and more colorful graphics. **********\"Style and new technology will cause you to get a new car every few years, and the same is true for software,\" said Spencer Leyton, senior vice president of business development for Borland International Inc., a leading software company. **********While selling upgrades and replacements can be a lucrative business, it means that the fast growth of the last decade might never be duplicated. Software companies like Borland, Lotus and Wordperfect know that selling a $100 upgrade package to the owner of a spreadsheet or word processor program is not as profitable as selling a new $500 program to the person who is just starting out. **********\"Saturation has to be increasingly viewed as an issue, and that's not going to go away,\" said Peter Rogers, personal computer analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company in San Francisco. In a recent survey conducted by the investment banking company, personal computer managers at large corporations said that on average 71 percent of their employees who might be able to make use of a personal computer already had one. **********Some computer industry executives take issue with such estimates and say there are still many untapped markets. \"We haven't at all seen the demise of the first-time user,\" said Winnie Briney, personal systems marketing director for I.B.M. **********A survey by Computer Intelligence, a market research firm in San Diego, indicates that 24 percent of companies, mainly small ones, still have no personal computers and 48 percent have fewer than five. Industry executives also say they see growth propelled by the increasingly popular laptop and notebook versions and new types of computers, like the pocket-sized models that use pens in place of keyboards. **********The industry also sees hope in new applications beyond accounting spreadsheets and word processing, like networks and software that allow a company's workers to collaborate on projects. Enhancements Rival First Sales **********Still, Inteco, a market research firm in Norwalk, Conn., estimates that replacement machines will account for 40 percent of personal computers sold in the United States this year, up from 23 percent in 1988. In terms of dollar value, sales of enhancements to existing machines will account for 39 percent of the United States market this year. That is only slightly less than the 40 percent of the market accounted for by new machines. Replacement machines will account for the other 21 percent of the dollars spent. **********For companies able to tap into the upgrade and replacement markets, business can be brisk. The stupendous growth in the last year by the Microsoft Corporation, the leading publisher of personal-computer software, has been fueled by sales of Windows 3.0, a software package that uses command menus and small pictures to make it much easier to operate a computer. **********Windows adds new features to Microsoft's venerable MS-DOS operating system and has been sold largely to people who already have computers running MS-DOS. Most recently, Microsoft has cashed in by selling nearly a million packages of MS-DOS 5, the latest version of the program, to customers who already owned earlier versions. **********Yet, even William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, is worried about market saturation. In a memo to employees in May, Mr. Gates said one of his long-term concerns was \"that companies will eventually equip all the employees that need software with a full complement of packages, and our only revenue opportunity will be upgrades or ephemeral information.\"  Mining the Installed Base **********Many other hardware and software companies are trying to mine the market that comprises their existing customers. **********\"The installed base is the most important asset the company has outside of its software,\" said Mr. Leyton of Borland International Inc., which makes a spreadsheet called Quattro Pro, among other products. Just how important was shown recently when Borland agreed to pay $440 million to buy its rival, the Ashton-Tate Company, best known for its popular database software called dBase. Analysts considered that a very high price, but noted Borland was not so much interested in Ashton-Tate's dBase as in its huge customer base. **********The Lotus Development Corporation created a special marketing group earlier this year that sells other software, accessories and even T-shirts by direct mail to the legions of registered users of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet. Lotus also now gets about 10 percent of its revenues from upgrades of 1-2-3, officials said. For the Wordperfect Corporation, producer of a popular word-processing program, the upgrade figure has been as high as 15 percent of quarterly revenues. **********And if selling to your own customers is good, why not sell to your competitors' customers? Why not indeed, say the software companies, which are busily raiding one another's installed bases. **********Borland has offered its Quattro Pro spreadsheet for only $130, well below the list price of $495, to people who already own Lotus 1-2-3. Analysts estimate that about 70 percent of the Quattro Pro sales have gone to owners of other types of spreadsheet. Now, Lotus, Microsoft, Wordperfect and other software companies are offering similar bargains to their competitors' customers. **********Such discounts would seem to cut into a software company's profits. But executives argue that such sales do not take the place of full-price sales because people who already own one spreadsheet or word-processing program would probably not switch to another if they had to pay full price. **********Moreover, once the customer is converted to a new product, there is the opportunity to sell upgrades later. Therefore, executives say, it pays to offer discounts to attract a new customer, just as magazines offer discounts to hook new subscribers.  I.B.M. Trade-Ins **********I.B.M. is trying a similar tactic with its new trade-in program. It will offer discounts toward new I.B.M. computers to customers who trade in not only old I.B.M. PC's, but also old Compaqs and Apples. **********Such trade-ins have been tried before by I.B.M. without much success. But this time the program is being met with more \"jubilation,\" said Ms. Briney of I.B.M. **********Industry analysts call the new enthusiasm the result of a higher number of old computers, which need someplace to go if new ones are to be purchased. **********I.B.M. refurbishes the trade-ins and sells them as used computers or uses the machines for parts. **********So far the Apple Computer Corporation and Compaq have not started trade-in programs. Lori Strong, vice president of product marketing at the Compaq Computer Corporation, said the company -- whose machines are used more often in offices than in homes -- did not yet see much demand for trade-in incentives. When an experienced user buys a new, more powerful machine, Ms. Strong said, the old computer typically goes to someone else in the same company in a sort of trickle-down effect.  Easier Upgrades **********Realizing that upgrading will become more important, many computer hardware companies are designing machines accordingly, so that users can, say, install a more powerful microprocessor without having to buy a whole new machine. The Tandon Corporation recently introduced a computer in which users can snap in new microprocessors or a new disk drive as easily as a consumer slips a tape into a video cassette recorder. **********It remains an open question how successful the computer industry will be in shifting toward replacement machines and programs. Software, and even computer hardware, do not wear out like cars do. **********Users who once snapped up any new programs are beginning to decide they may not need every new bell and whistle offered in the latest version of their spreadsheet or word-processing program. Others are not convinced that the additional increment in speed offered by a new microprocessor will really make their life easier. **********It is such doubts that nag at executives like Pete Peterson, executive vice president of Wordperfect. \"We are going to run into a situation,\" he said, \"where we have mature products that do a good job, so that people don't need to move up.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/world/after-the-war-un-sees-kuwaiti-recovery-from-sacking.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1991-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 245, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Now the young and restless network has lost ground in the ratings even as it expanded its program base. **********Advertising industry executives predict that Fox will take in less advertising money for its fall programs this year than it did last year. **********But Barry Diller, the chairman of Fox, is promising an announcement tomorrow on a change in program direction, just before the company officially introduces its fall lineup of prime-time programs. The announcement appears to be an attempt to counter the impression that the once-hot network has cooled down. Buzzword of the Business **********The move is consistent with Mr. Diller's and Fox's talent for seizing the attention of the television industry. Last spring, Fox was the buzzword of the business, principally for its daring decision to move its sudden and spectacular hit, \"The Simpsons,\" from a safe haven on Sunday night to a Thursday face-off with the most popular show of the previous half decade, \"The Cosby Show\" on NBC. **********At the same time, Fox had two other series with growing ratings and reputations, \"Married With Children\" and \"In Living Color.\" **********Fox was adding more viewers every week, especially the young adult viewers most sought by advertisers. Even executives at the other networks were acknowledging that they needed to find Fox-like shows for their own schedules. **********A year later, the attention -- and the noise level -- surrounding Fox are considerably more muted. **********In the television season that ended in April, Fox's overall rating slipped from a 6.5 to a 6.4. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) Fox added no new hit series; no Fox series, not even its big three from a year ago, increased its ratings from the previous season. Furthermore, Fox so overestimated the ratings its programs would receive that it was forced to offer free commercial time to advertisers for most of the second half of the season. **********Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, an advertising-buying service, predicts that \"Fox will get whacked real hard\" by advertisers this year. He said Fox, which took in about $500 million in advance commercial billings last spring, could fall as much as $200 million short of that amount during this year's \"up-front\" advertising buying season. **********\"I think the up-front could pass Fox right by,\" Mr. DeWitt said, adding that one big advantage Fox enjoyed last spring was gone. At the time, ABC, CBS and NBC were trying to institute a new system for guaranteeing ratings for advertisers, using complicated formulas based on discrepancies in the Nielsen ratings. **********\"Fox became close to a must-buy,\" Mr. DeWitt said. \"Now, after a year of weak advertising sales, you have three networks saying, 'Yessir, Mr. Advertiser.' And Fox is no longer a must-buy.\" **********Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, who had once been outspoken in calling for more Fox-style shows, now dismisses any idea of imitating Fox programming. \"That particular enthusiasm has run its course,\" he said. **********And the producers of \"The Simpsons,\" disappointed that television's most-talked-about show did not grow in its second year as most hit shows do, lobbied hard in the last week to be shifted back to Sunday night. **********But none of this apparent bad news has diminished the enthusiasm, or the cockiness, of the Fox executives. They offer nothing but positive assessments about the television season that just ended, about their expansion in September from three nights of programming to four, plus an occasional Monday night movie, and about the season to come. 'In Very Good Shape' **********\"We have the hard work accomplished,\" said Peter Chernin, the president of the Fox Entertainment Group. \"We feel we are in very good shape.\" **********That optimism may lead Fox to an altered plan for the network. One senior industry executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Diller's announcement tomorrow might involve a shift of one entire night of programming, from Friday night, when ABC's children-oriented shows dominate the younger audience that Fox wants, to either Tuesday or Wednesday night, when more young viewers would be available. **********Sam Simon, the executive producer of \"The Simpsons,\" said the show's producers \"lobbied intensively\" for Fox to make an equally dramatic announcement about \"The Simpsons\" this spring. \"We want them to put us back on Sunday,\" he said, though he added, \"I think it's unlikely.\" **********No matter what announcement Mr. Diller makes tomorrow, it will almost certainly not include any concession that this year's ambitious expansion was not a success. Mr. Chernin said Fox had made remarkable strides this year toward its long-term goal of a full seven-night prime-time schedule. \"We are now a force,\" he said. **********Fox overcame its chief potential impediment in March when the Federal Communications Commission redefined what a television network is in terms that will allow Fox to expand to 15 hours of prime-time programs without undermining its television syndication business. Although the three older networks are still not allowed to sell programs under the new regulations, Fox will still be able to earn profits from syndicated shows like \"A Current Affair.\" **********Mr. Chernin said Fox had succeeded in growing to a viable four-night network, with the possibility that the Monday-night movie would become a regular part of the Fox lineup. **********\"We have strong anchors we can build on,\" he said. He pointed to one new series, \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" as a growing phenomenon, especially among teen-age girls. **********Some advertising executives said Fox could be aiming its programs at too young an audience. Fox's ratings fell significantly this year among both men and women aged 18 to 49. But Fox demonstrated sharp growth among both teen-agers and children. The average age of the Fox audience fell to 28 from 29. **********\"You can skew too young for some advertisers,\" said Betsy Frank, senior vice president of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising. She said Fox would always be strong with advertisers like soft-drink and sneaker makers, but may have trouble selling to package-goods advertisers who want to reach a more adult audience. **********Mr. Chernin emphasized that Fox succeeded so far because it had a vision for the new network and stuck to it. \"We chose to take the ambitious, risky route,\" he said. \"We do shows that are distinctly Fox shows, shows that have a certain edge.\" Complaints About 'Slob-coms' **********Some critics have charged that the distinctive Fox edge is a low-brow mentality that often veers into outright vulgarity. One recent comedy, \"Top of the Heap,\" has been harshly criticized for heavy doses of sexual innuendo. Ms. Frank said the term increasingly being applied to Fox's kind of comedies was \"slob-coms.\" **********But Mr. Chernin said the criticism was unjust, pointing to the acclaimed work on \"The Simpsons\" and \"In Living Color.\" **********Mr. DeWitt believes Fox's problems are temporary. \"I think they will break out over time,\" he said. \"They've done a remarkable job so far. They've gotten to a decent plateau. They have to consolidate their gains while on this plateau and then they'll be ready for another jump.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/business/microsoft-widens-its-split-with-ibm-over-software.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1991-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Widens Its Split With I.B.M.

In addition, the company's outlook for the future was positive. **********Reflecting their widening split with I.B.M., Microsoft executives said they would no longer call a new operating system they are working on OS/2 3.0. Rather, the new operating system will be named Windows NT, standing for New Technology. And Windows NT will not be able to run programs written for OS/2, as had previously been planned. **********Microsoft said its strategy was to sell two different versions of Windows tailored for different types of computers but able to run the same programs. A low-end version of Windows will run on top of MS-DOS in computers using Intel Corporation microprocessors. Windows NT, which will be released next year, will be geared for more powerful computers and workstations using microprocessors from Intel as well as from MIPS Computer Systems. Windows NT will also be able to run programs like Lotus 1-2-3 written for MS/DOS. **********\"We do not see a technical discontinuity over the next four to five years,\" said Steven Ballmer, Microsoft senior vice president of systems software. \"We think we can evolve Windows.\" Microsoft officials seemed clearly stung by I.B.M.'s recent attempts to form alliances with Microsoft rivals, like Apple Computer Inc. and Novell. Mr. Ballmer said all these alliances were confusing and presented no clear picture of I.B.M.'s strategy.

To refute I.B.M.'s contention that OS/2 is more stable than Windows, Mr. Ballmer demonstrated several ways he could \"crash\" or stall a computer running OS/2. **********I.B.M. maintains that it is fully behind OS/2, which will be its strategic personal computer operating system.

Last week, Mr. Maxwell's sons, Ian and Kevin, filed for bankruptcy protection in the British courts for the family's private businesses. The New York Daily News, one of the family's companies, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law, and Kevin Maxwell vowed to keep the newspaper alive. Britain's Serious Fraud Office began investigating charges last week that Robert Maxwell illegally drained up to $765 million in Mirror Group P.L.C. pension funds to prop up his ailing businesses. It was also discovered that his private companies borrowed $538 million -- perhaps more -- from the public ones. The tattered empire with its hundreds of subsidiaries is now expected to be sold off. But according to John Talbot, an administrator appointed by the British courts, the assets may be significantly less than the liabilities. The Intractable Trade Problem  Economists often suffer from a disease called hardening of the categories. No matter what reality says, their paradigms stay the same. Trade is one of those categories. Despite seven years of a cut-rate dollar that was supposed to make American products more attractive, America's trade deficit with Japan has barely budged, though there has been remarkable progress elsewhere. And years of trade talks have not put many American goods on Japanese retail shelves. But while economists urge patience, business people are not optimistic. \"The Japanese have built a structure that is completely different from ours,\" said Arnold Brenner, an executive vice president in charge of the Japanese operations of Motorola Inc. \"For an American company, it is always going to be especially tough to break in.\"  G.E.'s Alliance With South Korea  The General Electric Company has been doing its part lately to bring down the trade balance by exporting jet engines, locomotives and power generators. Last week, it made a deal to sell a $400 million communications satellite to South Korea. The Lucky-Goldstar Business Group has agreed to be a partner in the project. G.E. beat British Aerospace P.L.C. for the contract. But it was not just G.E.'s experience that clinched the deal. It also agreed to transfer technology to its South Korean partners -- a promise that some fear might harm G.E. later. The Biggest L.B.O.   The collapsing Soviet Union got its own version of a leveraged buyout. Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of Russia, said last week he had reached an agreement with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for Russia -- the largest and richest republic -- to assume the central Government's debt and payroll. The power of the purse -- not to mention the fact that most of the republics have broken with Moscow -- elevates Mr. Yeltsin and downgrades Mr. Gorbachev. By taking over the budget, Mr. Yeltsin also gets control of the ruble. That gives him a lever to use to stabilize prices. The downside risk, as with all L.B.O.'s, is whether Mr. Yeltsin can afford to take on so much debt. Even Japan May Suffer  They are not exactly jumping out of windows, but Tokyo's investors are not a happy lot. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell more than 1 percent on a single day last week and since March has lost 17.3 percent of its value. Companies are also having trouble raising capital -- unusual in Japan. And some investors fear the English-speaking recession (it's hit America, Britain, Canada and Australia) will soon reach Japan. \"They are going into a contractionary period,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. Japan's rate of growth \"will decelerate from 3 to 6 percent to 0 to 3 percent and cause fiscal problems for the Government,\" he said. That's slow, but not a recession. \"What's happening in Japan is what happened here, but from a higher base,\" Mr. Weinberg said. Salomon Wins Back Confidence  Last week, after a three-month suspension, Salomon Brothers Inc. said it had won back the World Bank's business. The Bank, as it is called, is the second-largest borrower in the world's financial markets. Its decision was an indication that Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor who is Salomon's interim chairman, was succeeding in making the go-go Wall-Street firm more, well, Midwestern. The California Public Employee Retirement System -- the nation's largest -- is considering rescinding its suspension too. If that happens, Solly's rehabilitation may soon be complete. Sweden's Monetary Medicine  Most of the world considers it a bold move when the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the discount rate a quarter of a percentage point. Not in Sweden. Last week, Sweden's central bank increased the rate it charges banks to borrow to 17.5 percent from 11.5 percent -- a six percentage-point jump. COMPANIES **********Wanna Buy a Route? In Cash?   Last week, after its financing deal with Delta Air Lines unraveled, Pan American World Airlines shut down. The airline had been on the verge of extinction for almost a decade, selling off pieces of itself including its New York terminal and signature headquarters building until all that remained was a small domestic operation and some valuable Latin American and Caribbean routes. The routes will go on sale today. But there is one inhibiting factor. Judge Cornelius Blackshear of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District in Manhattan insists that all bids for Pan Am's routes be in cash. That's the one commodity in today's airline business that remains in short supply. Digital Quietly Tends to Business  While the International Business Machines Corporation anguishes in public about its future, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, continues to plod along. Last week, it unveiled four aggressively priced workstations built on a new, superfast RISC chip -- for reduced instruction set technology. And while I.B.M. and the Microsoft Corporation continue to feud, Digital and Microsoft are doing just fine, thank you. Digital's new boxes will run Microsoft's Windows NT, its newest operating system.  The Days of 3.25% Interest  For those who love 1950's nostalgia, consider this: Citibank, the nation's No. 1, bank, said last week it will lower the interest rate paid on passbook savings accounts to 3.15 percent from 4.34 percent at its Citibank FSB savings and loan in Chicago. That rate has not been around since Cadillacs had fins and blouses had Peter Pan collars.  ECONOMY **********Making Room for New Ideas  Though John Sununu liked to call himself the Administration's \"pit bull,\" many thought of the White House chief of staff, who resigned last week, as more of the monkey on the President's back. A conservative Republican, he helped fashion President Bush's economic strategy. But even conservatives grew to dislike his ideas. \"When faced with economic policy failures, he was incapable of admitting mistakes,\" said Edwin S. Rubenstein, an economist at the conservative National Review magazine. \"Holding to the budget agreement the way he did was a mistake -- hubris.\" Of the new chief of staff, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Mr. Rubenstein said: \"He's tough, not so ideological, but a 'yes' man.\"  A Sickly G.D.P.  The economy is still struggling to rouse itself from its slump. The Commerce Department said last week that gross domestic product expanded by a slim 1.7 percent in the third quarter. G.D.P. measures the total output of goods and services within America's borders. For an economy emerging from recession, growth is typically in the 6 percent range. \"Will there be a double-dip recession?\" asked Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. \"No. We'll have slow growth. But a persuasive case can be made for the other side of the argument.\"  Payrolls Drop; So Do Rates  The unemployment rate held steady in November at 6.8 percent, as expected. But payrolls tumbled by nearly 241,000, the second-largest drop of the year. Payroll statistics are considered more accurate. The drop in payrolls raised the Federal Reserve's level of concern about a possible \"double-dip\" recession; last week it dropped the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other, to 4.5 percent from 4.75.  A Few More Construction Dollars  No, it wasn't an aberration. Construction spending rose 1.0 percent in October, the fourth straight monthly gain and part of the longest string of advances in five years, the Commerce Department said. Despite the gain, spending on construction is still below last year's level. The industry \"needs an economic stimulus package, and we need it now,\" said Mark Tipton, president of the National Association of Home Builders. Manufacturing Peters Out  For months, the manufacturing sector was the lone horse pulling the nation's economic wagon. Domestic and export sales of manufactured goods grew as the rest of the economy languished. But manufacturing lost its snap in November. The National Association of Purchasing Management, which surveys 300 corporate executives on the size of their order books, said its index fell last month to 50.1, from 53.5 in October. A reading of 55 shows expansion, 50 indicates stagnation and below 44 signals recession. \"The economy grew perceptively weaker in November,\" said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee. Detroit Is Quick to Rejoice  Ten days of improved sales is not enough to signal an industrywide turnaround. Even so, the numbers sure looked good to Detroit. Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks climbed 20.9 percent in late November, the auto makers said last week. Sales to rental fleets pushed the sales figures higher. Though sales for the entire month were down, Detroit did win back some business from the Japanese. Detroit had 62.3 percent of the market last month, compared with 60.1 percent a year earlier. But before Detroit uncorks the champagne, it should recall that in the 1970's, the General Motors Corporation had 60 percent of the market all to itself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/26/business/northwest-air-request.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Northwest Air Request", "print_headline": "Northwest Air Request", "body_text": " **********Northwest Airlines has asked the Transportation Department to reconsider the carrier's application to fly nonstop between Detroit and London.

Dealers familiar with the bidding activities of Japanese firms said that while bids of around $3 billion were placed for the new notes, the firms subsequently turned around after the auction and unloaded their positions. 'We Are in the Business' **********\"The bids were made to show that we are in the business, and nothing else,\" a trader at one Japanese firm said yesterday. \"This was not an economic decision.\" **********For the last year or so, high domestic interest rates, smaller current account surpluses and problems in Japanese financial markets have sharply reduced the amount of new funds that Japanese investors are willing to commit to American financial assets like Treasury securities. **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices were narrowly mixed. Note prices dipped slightly after the auction results were announced, but bond prices rose somewhat, and long-term interest rates flirted briefly with 8 percent. **********Despite the success of the three-year note sale, credit market participants said the results showed nothing about how investors would react to offerings today and tomorrow of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Indeed, most traders said interest rates on the securities would probably have to move a bit higher from their current levels to insure strong demand. **********\"At this point, the Street is asking itself if the market is going to improve further over the next few weeks,\" a government bond trader said. \"Right now, it looks like there will be no news for a while that could help the market. That means yields on the 10's and 30's might need to back up a bit.\" **********Peter Bass, a managing director at S. G. Warburg & Company, said: \"The market will have to get a little bit cheaper, but not a lot, to sell the debt. I think there is decent domestic interest in securities, and that a yield of 7.85 percent for the 10-year and 8.05 for the bonds would attract interest.\" **********Late yesterday, the new 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.82 percent. The 30-year bonds were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 8 percent. No Reaction to Car Figures **********The sense that for the time being traders have already discounted more bad news on the economy was reinforced yesterday when the bond market essentially yawned after the nation's leading car manufacturers reported that sales in the last 10 days of January were a mere 5.4 million units at an annual rate. **********For all of January, car sales were only 5.9 million units, seasonally adjusted. Analysts said it was the first time the monthly total had fallen below six million since January 1987. **********The auto sales figures \"suggest a decline in January retail sales of some 1.2 percent,\" analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in their daily market commentary. The level is \"consistent with a recessionary pullback in consumer spending, they added. **********Auto sales numbers often elicit a reaction in the credit markets, but not so yesterday. **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 108 6/32, up by 7/ 32, to yield 8.02 percent, compared with 8.04 percent late on Monday. Earlier in the session, the bond was offered at a price to yield 8 percent. **********Among note issues, the 7 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 13/32, down by 1/32, to yield 7.40 percent. And the price of the 7 percent two-year notes fell by 1/32, to 100 3/8, to yield 6.79 percent. **********Rates on short-term Treasury bills dipped slightly. **********Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.93 percent late yesterday, down by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.91 percent. **********In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the Federal Reserve's moves late last week to lower its discount rate and the overnight Federal funds rate generated a strong rally in bank bonds. **********Dealers said yields on outstanding issues of money-center banks like Chemical Bank and Citicorp fell by 50 basis points to a full percentage point. **********The rally in bank bonds was far stronger than what was experienced in the rest of the investment-grade market. Nevertheless, market participants said prices of most corporate bonds rose by a quarter of a point to three-eighths of a point in active trading. **********In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, traders said that a $138 million issue of bonds sold by the Municipal Assistance Corporation for New York City was well received. **********Elsewhere in the municipal bond market, the Massachusetts Health an Education Department sold $150 million in securities for Harvard University in a negotiated deal. **********The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities of 1992 to 2005, and three term bonds. **********Yields on the serial bonds range from 4.85 percent on securities maturing in 1992 to 6.50 percent on those maturing in 2005. **********Term bonds maturing in 2011 and 2015 carried the maximum yield of 6.62 percent. **********B T Securities Inc. acted as lead underwriter for the offering, which is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********In the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely-quoted issues were unchanged to up an eighth of a point. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.720 Average Yield . . . 6.98% Low Price . . . 99.720 High Yield . . . 6.98% High Price . . . 99.747 Low Yield . . . 6.97% Accepted at low price . . . 61% Total applied for . . . $41,483,080 Accepted . . . $12,647,510 N.Y. applied for . . . $39,145,230 N.Y. accepted . . . $12,040,150 Noncompetitive . . . $769,000 Interest set at . . . 6 7/8% The three-year notes mature Feb. 15, 1994."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/09/business/latest-victim-of-airline-slump.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1991-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Latest Victim of Airline Slump", "print_headline": "Latest Victim of Airline Slump", "body_text": " **********The hard times in the airline industry claimed another victim today when Air Europe, a large British carrier, and its parent, the International Leisure Group Ltd., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors and grounded the airline's fleet, stranding 25,000 people. **********And in another sign that airlines expect no quick recovery from the severe downturn gripping the industry, British Airways, Britain's largest airline, said it was withdrawing from five unprofitable routes. It is ending service between Gatwick Airport near London and Stockholm; Barcelona; Karachi, Pakistan; Banjul, Gambia, and Freetown, Sierra Leone. **********British Airways had previously announced that it would withdraw from other routes, make big cuts in its work force and delay the delivery of ordered planes. \"Since then, the situation has not improved and we have had to look closely at further uneconomic parts of the route network,\" Liam Strong, director of marketing and operations at British Airways, said today.   'A Bad Omen' **********Although dwarfed by British Airways, Air Europe expanded quickly and became Britain's second-largest scheduled international carrier. It has a fleet of 37 planes, 2,000 employees and offered scheduled service to 19 destinations in Europe, mostly from Gatwick Airport but also from Manchester. It also offered charter service in Europe and to Orlando, Fla.; North Africa, and East Asia. **********Analysts said Air Europe was in the vanguard of the new airlines trying to exploit the opportunities created by the continuing deregulation of the European airline industry. The market is dominated by a handful of large carriers, most of which are at least partly owned by governments. **********\"The financial collapse of Air Europe is a bad omen because what it in effect says is the cost of entering the market is prohibitive,\" said Richard Whitaker, editor of Airline Business, a trade magazine. \"Air Europe offered real competition because it flew head to head with major carriers on major routes like Paris and Brussels and offered cheaper fares.\" **********Peter Bergius, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd., commented, \"There will be other small airlines that go under or are forced to link with others.\" A small German carrier, German Wings, went out of business last year and a small British carrier, Dan-Air, is struggling. **********Air Europe was founded in the late 1970's by Harry Goodman, a British entrepreneur who first focused on providing packaged holidays for Britons and then expanded into scheduled service. He hoped that by building a fleet of fuel-efficient planes, Air Europe would be able to capture business from the high-cost European giant airlines that dominate the market. **********He seemed to be well on his way to succeeding. In the year that ended Oct. 31, Air Europe carried 3.7 million scheduled and chartered passengers. **********Mr. Whitaker of Airline Business said Air Europe's scheduled service was similar in quality to that of the big airlines while the fares were about 15 percent less for business-class seats and about 10 percent less in the economy class. **********The packaged holiday companies owned by International Leisure, which include Intasun, Select, Global and Lancaster, are collectively No. 2 in the business in Britain. But the company was pushed into a crisis by the combination of large debt, a sharp decline in the packaged holiday market that began in 1989, and the rise in fuel costs and the plunge in travelers because of the Persian Gulf conflict and the recession in Britain. 'Ran Out of Cash' **********\"It turned out to be too much, and they ran out of cash,\" said Timothy Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the accounting firm. Mr. Hayward, one of the court-appointed administrators for International Leisure, was pessimistic that the group would survive. He said it was more likely that its parts would be sold and said several airlines, which he declined to identify, had expressed interest. **********Citibank disclosed today that a syndicate of 14 banks that it led had asked the court to appoint an administrative receiver to take control of 12 leased aircraft to cover the group's exposure to International Leisure. Others said the exposure was $315 million, which a banker confirmed. **********Citibank said in a statement that the banks took action only after \"we were advised by International Leisure Group that they had not been successful in raising the additional finance required for continuation of its operations.\" **********Mr. Hayward also said the action by the banks \"was not the cause of the company's collapse.\" **********International Leisure is privately owned and does not regularly release financial figures. It said in its court filing that it had lost $:50 million ($98.3 million) from November through January. Mr. Hayward said the group had total liabilities of $:480 million, of which $:200 million was related to leased planes. Its liabilities exceed its assets by $:15.4 million, he said.  A Long Struggle **********The company was known to have been struggling for a long time and had acknowledged that it was talking with Lloyds Bank and several large shareholders about financial relief. It recently withdrew its applications to offer service to New York, Los Angeles, the Caribbean, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. **********Mr. Goodman seemed to get a reprieve in January, when Lloyds agreed to a plan that would have converted an overdraft of $:50 million into equity. While the conversion has not yet been put into effect, Brian Butler, a Lloyds spokesman, said today's decision to seek bankruptcy protection was not the result of a change of mind by Lloyds. **********\"We certainly haven't withdrawn our support in any way at all,\" Mr. Butler said. \"We're disappointed that the company has had to cease operations. We tried to find a way forward and will continue to do so.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/04/world/europe-plans-yugoslav-peace-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Montgomery", "pub_date": "1991-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 621, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Plans Yugoslav Peace Talks", "print_headline": "Europe Plans Yugoslav Peace Talks", "body_text": " **********The European Community decided today to convene a Yugoslav peace conference here beginning on Saturday to try to find a solution to the many conflicts dividing that country. **********The conference, with Lord Carrington of Britain as chairman, would try to begin a two-month arbitration process to give binding decisions on the ethnic and nationality divisions inflaming Yugoslavia.

Prince Sultan, the Defense Minister, said the Aziz-Gorbachev meeting would \"have no effect on the military situation unless the Iraqi regime follows the correct path\" and unconditionally withdraws from Kuwait. **********Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal, spokesman for the United States command here, tried to discourage speculation that an offensive was imminent. He said that the longer the allies waited, the better shape their assault troops would be in. But other headquarters officers disputed that and said it would be difficult to maintain combat readiness more than a week. **********\"The politicians have to realize that you cannot keep soldiers at a fever pitch indefinitely,\" said the commander of a British armored brigade. \"We've finished our practice. The guns are loaded. The troops are on a knife-edge of anticipation. It is time for a quick, positive decision.\" **********\"This week is ideal,\" an American colonel said. \"There's no moon, the tides are right, we're sharp. I expect that we'll get the word from Washington shortly and then hit Saddam with everything that we've got.\" **********There was every indication that if the allies attack, they plan to penetrate Iraqi territory as well as ousting the Iraqis from Kuwait. Maj. Chris Batchelder of Syracuse, a specialist in military government with the 3d Armored Division, told pool correspondents that such administrations would be set up in all captured areas. **********Allied intelligence believes that the Iraqis' fighting strength has been sapped by a month of ceaseless bombing, which continued today despite unfavorable weather. Brig. Gen. Daniel Gazeau, deputy commander of French ground forces, said the enemy is \"very close to the point where it's impossible for him to conduct offensive actions.\" **********Some bombing missions were canceled and others were diverted to secondary targets because of thick cloud cover, but pilots still managed 2,400 sorties, raising the total reported for the war to 80,000. Included were 870 over Kuwait, 100 against positions of the Republican Guard along the Kuwait-Iraq frontier, and 130 in search of launchers for Scud missiles. **********Sirens sounded in Baghdad during the hours before dawn, and in the suburbs, brilliant fireballs were seen, Western journalists in Iraq said. More heavy raids were carried out on the Iraqi capital during the day, and then tonight, Tomahawk cruise missiles shrieked in from the south, some of them landing near the hotel where foreign journalists are staying.  Flamboyant Rescue Mission **********An American F-16 was shot down over Kuwait, the 21st United States aircraft lost to enemy fire. But a search-and-rescue team composed of helicopters and fighters raced 40 miles behind enemy lines -- into \"Indian country,\" in General Neal's phrase -- and rescued the pilot. **********Even after all the allied air strikes, General Neal conceded, anti-aircraft fire from artillery guns remains very heavy in places. And Group Capt. Niall Irving, the British military spokesman, said that Royal Air Force pilots were spotting a large number of mobile surface-to-air missile sites in Kuwait. **********The Tripoli, an 18,500-ton amphibious assault ship carrying 2,000 marines, is part of a 31-vessel task force operating in the northern end of the Persian Gulf in anticipation of a possible Marine landing. The flagship of a mine countermeasures group, she carries a crew of 680. Four were hurt when a floating mine blew a hole 16 feet by 20 feet in her hull below the waterline. **********General Neal said all four of those hurt had been treated by medics on board. Watertight doors were slammed shut to control flooding. **********\"We've encountered a number of mines,\" Capt. Bruce McEwen told his crew on the Tripoli's closed-circuit television system after the blast at 4:36 A.M., which jarred those on the vessel awake in an instant. **********\"The ship is stable,\" he said. \"The ship is at no risk.\" **********While British and American helicopters circled above, pool reports said, marking other mines with smoke for destruction, the Tripoli sat dead in the water for several hours. Power was later restored, but Captain McEwen said he was not sure that the hull could be repaired in the gulf. **********\"We've got two compartments that are completely full, and they're 60 by 50 feet, so we took a lot of water,\" said Adonis Oldenburg, 19 years old, from Las Vegas, Nev., a damage-control worker and fireman's apprentice. **********An hour after the Tripoli was hit, and about 10 nautical miles away, the two-year-old Princeton was helping to screen the minesweepers. It set off an influence mine, which is detonated by the proximity of a ship. No hole resulted, but one of two propellers was damaged, forcing the vessel to operate at half-power, and a large crack was opened, running from the main deck through two upper decks. **********Two sailors suffered minor injuries and a third incurred a head wound. **********The 9,600-ton Princeton, with a crew of 360, is a Ticonderoga-class cruiser costing more than $1 billion. It is equipped with an Aegis computer-linked radar and missile system for air defense. That system was reported fully operational. **********Not since April 1988 when the American missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts was nearly blown in half by an Iranian mine during the Iran-Iraq war has a United States ship hit a mine in the gulf. More than 80 mines, believed to have been dumped into the gulf by the Iraqis, have been found and destroyed in the last few months, but until today, no allied warship had hit one. **********On the Saudi-Kuwaiti frontier, British artillery opened up on Iraqi targets for the first time. Asked whether that meant an attack was near, Brigadier Rob McAfee of the British Army replied, \"I'd rather the Iraqis made their own deductions about that.\" **********He said that 18 targets had been fired on, with three Iraqi tanks, three guns and three gun positions destroyed. One purpose of the barrage was to \"unmask enemy guns,\" the brigadier said, meaning persuade them to fire and give away their locations. **********British and American tanks appeared to be rolling into position for a concerted attack involving more than three divisions. Bulldozers cut through the berms, and armored reconnaissance vehicles took up positions beside the pathways they created. Markers with arrows and brigade symbols, a British pool report said, have been set up to guide armor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/16/business/company-news-increased-activity-in-collagen-stock.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Increased Activity In Collagen Stock", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Increased Activity In Collagen Stock", "body_text": " **********The Collagen Corporation said there was no business reason for the recent share-price volatility and increased trading in its common stock.

But several others were not so sure that Pepsi's final choice had been a good one. **********Mr. Pirko, for one, said that for all the attention Pepsi was directing at the new logo, it looked much like many corporate designs churned out for other corporations over the years. **********\"It looks like United Airlines to me, or I.B.M.,\" Mr. Pirko said. \"The guy sitting next to me on the airplane said that it looks like the Korean flag.\" **********Part of the thinking behind the new design, Pepsi-Cola officials said, was to link the Pepsi and Diet Pepsi brands more closely on the shelf. **********\"For some time, the consumer feedback on Pepsi and Diet Pepsi has been that one is the stepchild of the other,\" said Hellen Berry, a vice president of marketing with the Beverage Marketing Corporation in New York. \"The new layout really links the two together.\" **********Analysts said that whether consumers were pleased with the new logo was less important than the fact that the logo was new. Younger buyers are attracted to packaging that seems to be on the cutting edge of style, even if the product itself is older than their grandparents. **********The new design, the eighth in the company's 97-year history, comes after Pepsi scored a number of victories with its commercials and marketing campaigns in recent years, at least in the eyes of people in the advertising industry. **********Pepsi's successes include a commercial that features Ray Charles saying \"You've got the right one baby, uh-huh,\" which was lauded by advertising executives as one of the most effective campaigns of recent years. This past summer, Pepsi's \"cool cans,\" incorporating bold designs of surfers, sunglasses and confetti, also proved highly popular. **********Coke, meanwhile, had some notable public relations failures. It had to pull its \"magic cans\" off the market last year when the cans, which were supposed to offer surprises inside, including money, malfunctioned and caused consumers to complain that the soda tasted bad. Coke also pulled humorous Diet Coke commercials from the Super Bowl, out of fear that they contrasted poorly with the nation's somber mood at the time, with hundreds of thousands of troops in the Persian Gulf. **********More often than not, the Pepsi-Coke battle is won or lost not in the marketplace -- where Pepsi's and Coke's standings have remained relatively unchanged -- but in the rather insular community of advertising executives. But many analysts say the key to growth in coming years will be capturing the loyalty of younger consumers, something Pepsi hopes to do with its new red, white and blue logo. **********\"Our assignment was to take Pepsi into the 1990's,\" said Ronald Peterson, a managing partner at Blyth Associates, the marketing firm that designed the logo. \"The fact that the logo is by itself, with an italized face, gives it motion and action. It gives it a much more dynamic look.\" **********Pepsi sells more soda in supermarkets than Coca-Cola, but Coke has an advantage in overall sales. Coke's share of the market has hovered at about 40 percent over the years, and Pepsi's share has remained about 30 percent. Over the last year, soft drink sales barely grew. **********\"The overall soft drink market has been in the doghouse,\" said Wiliam Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"Pepsi has described itself as 'the choice of a new generation' for a long time. That generation, they are afraid, is like me, approaching 40.

The next day, no,\" said Staff Sgt. Wayne O'Neil of the 101st Airborne Division, pondering whether he wanted to end the current relentless bombing of Iraq and begin a ground war. **********\"It's time, I'm ready to go home,\" he said, surveying his universe of a tent, his eight-man unit handling TOW antitank missiles mounted on trucks, and endless wind-blown, rock-strewn sand. **********\"Because of the frustration and anger, you'd like to begin the attack,\" he said. \"But that would be stupid on our part. Especially with all the married personnel, we want to go home as safe as possible. Then some days, you say, why not? We're ready, let's take the chance.\" **********Along the miles of northern Saudi border where the 101st Airborne Division is strung out -- military security regulations preclude giving exact locations or plans -- there is a sense of heightened anticipation and preparation. The mission of the 101st will be to land by helicopter far behind enemy lines, attacking Iraqi troops holding Kuwait from the north. **********Throughout the darkness on Thursday night, the division's helicopters droned overhead. In the first morning light, a long, gray smudge from the night's bombing hung low over the northern horizon. **********But there is little sense of urgency among the soldiers who have already been here for six months, only a quiet, businesslike concentration on specific jobs, with ears continually cocked toward small transistor radios carrying news on Armed Forces Radio and the BBC.  Softening Up the Enemy **********The senior officers say they are happy to have the bombing go on, reducing potential American casualties while cutting down Iraqi military power. **********\"Every artillery piece they take out by air is one less I have to worry about,\" said Lieut. Col. Harlan Lawson, commander of an artillery battalion whose 105-millimeter howitzers will go to battle slung under helicopters. **********Roughly 60 percent of the soldiers in the 101st are married; young privates and corporals with nascent mustaches clip pictures of their children to the sun visors of their boxy-looking vehicles. **********The word here is that at the division's home base, in Fort Campbell, Ky., the traditional rough, male barracks-room life is almost a thing of the past. Instead, top sergeants drop by their younger troops' houses before payday, peeking in the refrigerator to see how the family is managing on Army pay. The division has family support sessions now at Fort Campbell, showing videotapes of the soldiers to their wives. **********Many soldiers here, from low-ranking enlisted men to majors and colonels, have spouses also serving in Saudi Arabia, some careerists, others from reserve units. That nearness is in many ways an additional worry and burden on the troops, especially since, several said, mail from a few hundred miles away is taking many days to arrive. **********About 9 percent of the soldiers in this paratroop division are women, trudging across the sand under Kevlar helmets and armored vests with rifles slung over their shoulders. While some are perimeter security guards, others are helicopter pilots almost certain to see fire in an assault. 'The Square War' **********The prohibition on alcohol and drugs in this strict Islamic kingdom has cut disciplinary problems, said First Sgt. Victor Edwards, \"not 90 percent, but 99.9 percent.\" **********Perhaps as a result, there is a wholesomeness among the soldiers here that has led some to dub this \"the square war.\" The other night, two majors standing in front of a top-secret operations map compared notes on the Boy Scout troops they lead at home. **********This is an army that delights in its new high-tech equipment, particularly the night-vision goggles that turn darkness into an eerie but discernable green light.

Like the rest of these complex, self-contained units, the engineers, who will be in the first wave of the invasion, were focused on their specific jobs. **********\"Minefields, yes, that's definitely one of the most important of our jobs,\" Sgt.

Its operations would stretch from the coastal cities of Baltimore and Miami to the oilfields of West Texas, and it would have assets of $116 billion.  Bigger Than BankAmerica **********It would surpass the BankAmerica Corporation, which had $111.9 billion in assets as of March 31. Only Citicorp, with assets of $216.9 billion, would be larger in the United States. **********If NCNB can bring off the deal, it would open a new realm for super-regional banks, which began in the early 1980's as some states opened their borders to interstate acquisitions. **********NCNB, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., has grown rapidly into Florida, and five other states including Texas -- where it wrangled billions of dollars in Federal assistance in 1988 to take over the failed First Republicbank, the state's largest. **********In a decade, Hugh L. McColl Jr., NCNB's fiercely competitive chairman and chief executive, has taken his little-known bank with big ambitions and created a banking behemoth by acquiring a hodgepodge of community banks, failed banks and savings and loans as well as regional institutions. **********NCNB has grown into one of the nation's 10 largest banking companies, has $66 billion in assets, from the North Carolina National Bank with $7.7 billion in assets in 1981. **********In addition to NCNB, other strong regional banking companies include Banc One, of Columbus, Ohio; Fleet/ Norstar, of Providence, R.I.; NBD, of Detroit; Norwest, of Minneapolis and Suntrust, of Atlanta. **********The prospect of an NCNB-C&S/Sovran merger \"is potentially a catalytic event for the banking industry,\" said James J. McDermott, Jr., president of Keefe, Bruyette, Woods Inc., a bank research firm in New York. **********William M. Isaac, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said, \"It is enlarging and redefining the emerging super-regional banks.\" He added that the strong earnings power of regional banking organizations like NCNB allows them to make acquisitions of weaker institutions. **********Many industry experts believe 10 to 15 super-regional banking organizations will emerge before the decade is out, ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion in assets. \"We are going to see the banking industry continue to consolidate,\" Mr. Isaac predicted. **********Banking experts have long anticipated that some hard-charging regional banks would come to rival some of the nation's biggest banks in money centers like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Word of a possible merger moved C&S/Sovran's stock on the New York Stock Exchange to close as $22.75, up $3.375. NCNB's shares on the Big Board closed at $38.25, up 12.5 cents. **********A person close to NCNB said the deal would be worth almost $4 billion in stock for shareholders of C&S/Sovran. **********A spokesman for C&S/Sovran, which has headquarters in Atlanta and Norfolk, Va., Scott Scredon, said yesterday that the company's chairman and chief executive, Bennett A. Brown, had been authorized to meet with NCNB's Mr. McColl, \"to discuss the North Carolina bank's proposal to merge.\" It said that Mr. Brown would discuss NCNB's offer with the C&S/ Sovran board today. **********In a statement, NCNB confirmed \"preliminary and exploratory\" discussions between the companies and added it looked forward to continuing the talks. **********Mr. McDermott, the banking analyst, said investors were unconvinced by Wednesday's announcements that NCNB would eventually succeed in adding C&S/Sovran to its growing network. \"We are in the early stages,\" he cautioned. In the past, big bank mergers have hit snags and Mr. McColl's blunt, outspoken style has a reputation for rubbing some people the wrong way. Earlier Takeover Proposal **********C&S/Sovran was forged last year from two regional companies, the Citizens & Southern Corporation, based in Atlanta, and the Sovran Financial Corporation, of Norfolk, Va., after Mr. Brown of Citizens & Southern rejected a hostile takeover offer from NCNB in 1989. **********For NCNB, C&S with or without Sovran had some attractive strategic advantages. Since, 1985, when NCNB bitterly lost out in a bid to acquire a big Atlanta bank, Mr. McColl has been minor player in Georgia and Atlanta where C&S dominates the market and the economy grew robustly in the mid-1980's. **********Now with Sovran, NCNB would get a large franchise in the suburban Washington market. That area is mired in a real estate recession, but Mr. McColl has perceived the region as a lucrative consumer banking market with long-term growth potential. **********Besides Georgia and Washington's suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, a C&S/Sovran deal would include banks in the deal Tennessee, South Carolina, Kentucky, Maryland and Florida.  Problems From Earlier Merger **********For C&S/Sovran, a combination with NCNB may be the best solution for a merger that had its problems. Many C&S/Sovran shareholders have been disappointed with the results. Wall Street analysts faulted company executives earlier this year for moving too slowly to trim payrolls and exploit other cost-cutting opportunities that usually provide the economic appeal for regional banking mergers. **********The company reported a 72 percent drop in earnings in the first quarter along with a jump in nonperforming assets to $1.1 billion, or more than 3 percent of loans outstanding -- an unhealthy level. The recession was a factor, but the main problems included bad loans on several commercial real estate projects in the Washington area. **********The company continues to pay a dividend and has adequate capital, but its stock value has plunged. Mr. Brown, who is 62 years old, postponed his retirement planned for the end of this year and agreed to stay for at least another year.  Change of Attitude Possible **********But some individuals believe that Mr. Brown, who refused in 1989 to meet with NCNB's Mr. McColl, to discuss the earlier takeover offer, is more willing to bargain now because a takeover by NCNB would bring a more rapid payoff for C&S/Sovran shareholders than would be required if the company remained independent. **********John S. Poelker, a financial consultant in Atlanta who worked with Mr. Brown for eight years as president of Citizens & Southern between 1978 and 1986, said the big question facing directors on Thursday will be how fast the company's earnings and stock value can rebound on their own compared with the bid NCNB puts on the table. **********\"Clearly, the combination of C&S/ Sovran with NCNB creates a very powerful entity with a lot of resources,\" Mr. Poelker said. He said C&S/Sovran would require as many as three years before the stock could recover from the recent setbacks. **********A person close to NCNB said Mr. McColl's offer was to exchange each common share of C&S/Sovran for three-quarter share of NCNB stock. C&S/Sovran has 133.4 million common shares outstanding. **********Figured at the closing price Wednesday for NCNB's shares, at $38.25, the deal would be worth $28.69 a share for C&S/Sovran shareholders, a 26 percent premium over C&S/Sovran's closing stock price of $22.75 yesterday on the Big Board. **********In a separate announcement, NCNB said its earnings for the second quarter would fall slightly, to $1.20 to $1.25 a share, compared with $1.26 a share in the corresponding period last year. Profits will be flat or slightly higher than the $1.20 a share earned in the first quarter this year, the company said, with nonperforming loans rising $20 million to $50 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/25/world/baker-asks-asians-to-move-warily-on-new-pacts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1991-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 635, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker Asks Asians to Move Warily on New Pacts", "print_headline": "Baker Asks Asians to Move Warily on New Pacts", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A.

Layoffs of correspondents and other news employees are expected to be announced in the next several weeks, especially at CBS, which is facing companywide budget cuts that one senior network executive said would total $150 million. **********Next week, the networks will begin a monthlong cost-cutting experiment with CNN in pooling camera crews covering the President's daily activities. That pooling will extend to at least some of the President's travel schedule. Although CNN is planning to expand its worldwide coverage, it too is looking for ways to hold down spending. **********The television news organizations decided independently last week that the President's weekend fishing trip to Isla Morada, Fla., could be covered by a greatly reduced staff using a pool crew. That decision indirectly led to the cancellation Friday of the charter flight of reporters that traditionally accompanies the President when he travels out of Washington. A representative of the White House travel office said it was the first time the press plane had been canceled in the 30 years he had helped schedule those flights. **********The three broadcast networks have already cut the size of their news staffs by several hundred people each in the last five years and have reduced the number of their domestic and foreign bureaus. NBC News, for example, which had 1,362 staff members in 1986, is now down to 1,033, despite having more news programs on the air. And ABC, the leading network news division, has closed domestic bureaus in Boston, Chicago and Dallas and foreign bureaus in Frankfurt, Prague and Budapest -- consolidating them into one bureau in Berlin. **********\"It's all part of the same picture,\" Mr. Peyronnin said. \"It is all a matter of economically prudent management trying to spend its dollars in a cost-effective way.\" **********But Steve Friedman, the executive producer of the \"NBC Nightly News,\" said. \"We're doing this to save money, yes, but our role is changing, too. We're not in the overall killer-coverage business anymore. We're in the program business.\" 'One Picture of Bush' **********Mr. Friedman said the networks would increasingly cover stories based on the needs of specific news programs and less as a means of insuring that every event had a separate network presence. \"We all had the one picture of Bush fishing in Florida if anybody wanted to use it,\" Mr. Friedman said. **********Another senior network news executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the trip was not expected to make news. \"This was a dog trip anyway,\" he said. \"Nobody wanted to go on it.\" The executive said the decision to pull back from covering the President's trip was not setting a precedent. **********But Jack Nelson, the Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, said reporters from print publications who had intended to take the press charter could not do so because, without full network participation, the trip became prohibitively expensive. News organizations pay for the seats on the press plane for their reporter or reporters, but unlike on a commercial airliner, the price per seat depends on the number of passengers. The fewer the passengers, the higher the cost per person.  More Than First Class **********The cost of the press flights has generally averaged out to about 50 percent more than it would cost to fly a commercial flight in first class, Mr. Peyronnin said. He added that the extra cost was used by the White House to set up telephones, copy speeches and perform other general services for the press. **********Sean Walsh, an assistant White House press secretary, said that 70 to 80 journalists typically flew on the press plane that follows the President. Network news employees usually make up close to half that total. **********This past weekend, Mr. Walsh said, the networks had signed up for only eight seats on the plane. Mr. Nelson of The Los Angeles Times said the White House first said the trip cost for each reporter would increase to about $2,000. But as print organizations declined to ride because of the cost, the amount continued to go up, he said, eventally reaching $16,000. At that price all organizations dropped out.  Flew on Commercial Flights **********News organizations then arranged to fly reporters to Florida on commercial flights. The network news organizations also sent additional crews to Florida, some from New York, some from the network's local television stations in Miami. **********Mr. Peyronnin said the networks \"are reviewing the costs of everything\" in the wake of the war and what he called \"changes in the television economy.\" The networks have all suffered from a soft marketpace for advertising. **********Part of that review of costs, Mr. Peyronnin said, was the fact that the networks have been \"all but underwriting the costs of the press planes because we have always assigned so many people to cover the President.\" **********Mr. Friedman said the shrinking staffs and declining number of bureaus made it \"much harder to do the job than it used to be in the old days when we had a complete menu to choose from.\" He said the new strategy was to fly correspondents to stories."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/business/mutual-funds-management-is-asking-for-a-raise.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1991-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds; Management Is Asking for a Raise", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds; Management Is Asking for a Raise", "body_text": " **********For many mutual fund investors, 1990 was a losing year. But the fund industry over all pulled through in fine shape, reaching $1 trillion in assets. Now funds want bigger profits for themselves. **********A hot trend among funds is to seek larger management fees. Such fees are collected annually by all funds, even \"no load\" funds that impose no sales charges, and they come on top of exit fees, redemption fees and other one-time charges. In the last few months, half a dozen fund groups have asked shareholders to approve increases in management and advisory fees. And there is little doubt that other fund groups will follow suit. **********\"As more and more groups raise their fees, so will the rest of the industry,\" said W. Sam Chandoha, a senior vice president with the Shareholder Communications Corporation, a New York proxy solicitation firm. **********In February, shareholders voted down proposed fee increases in three Fidelity funds. But all other recent proposed fee increases passed. T. Rowe Price received increases on five funds in April. Scudder and Seligman also won raises. **********The high approval rate is \"unusual, because it's a direct cost to the shareholder,\" Mr. Chandoha said. Others say the fact that the stock market is near all-time highs makes it easier for funds to push through fee increases. Most funds asking for such increases have argued that their fees were lower than their competitors'. **********John C. Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, thinks the fund industry is already making enough money. He calls the recent round of proposed rises in fees astonishing. Nonetheless, he said: \"It's up to the shareholders. If they don't have the gumption to vote against them, it's their problem.\" Government regulation prevents funds from raising fees unilaterally. **********Industry observers cite a variety of factors propelling fees upward. For one, courts have shown no inclination to limit the fees funds can collect. In a closely watched case, an investor in the Franklin U.S. Government Securities Fund sued, saying the fees to manage the fund were too high. The judge found Franklin was earning an after-tax profit of 35 percent but concluded that was a fair return.  In late March, a Federal appeals court affirmed the decision. **********The push to increase recurring management fees comes as one-time charges are under siege. Last fall, the National Association of Securities Dealers proposed a rule that would cap the crazy mix of up-front sales loads, exit fees and 12b-1 plans, which pay certain marketing expenses, at 7.25 percent, or 6.25 percent for funds that also charge an annual \"shareholder servicing fee\" of a quarter of 1 percent, the maximum allowed. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must approve the proposal, asked for public comment. **********At the same time, several funds are reducing up-front sales charges. The Oppenheimer group just replaced its 8.5 percent sales load with 5.75 percent fees. In the last year or so, Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, American and Putnam all reduced many up-front charges. **********To some industry observers, it is a clear case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other. Because most investors focus on sales charges, funds are inclined to raise fees \"in an area where no one is paying attention,\" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consulting firm. **********Others suggest that increases in management fees are aimed at compensating the funds for the loss of revenue that will result when the N.A.S.D. fee caps are imposed. In some cases, the 12b-1 fees pay the salespeople who pitch the funds while management fees are used to pay the fund's adviser. But in many cases, one company owns both the fund's distributor and its adviser, so money from both sources ends up in one pocket. **********Oddly, as the N.A.S.D. and the S.E.C. review proposals to force funds to lower fees, the handful of states that had set caps on total expenses that can be charged on funds have dropped them amid industry lobbying. **********That clears the way for higher management fees, \"a strategy that fund advisors can take to boost shrinking margins,\" said Carl Frischling, a New York lawyer who specializes in mutual funds. **********There is no doubt that margins are being squeezed. Before the 1987 market crash, pretax margins on publicly traded fund companies ranged from 40 to 45 percent, said Dean P. Eberling, an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. That has dropped to roughly 30 percent. **********Others insist that fee increases are just a question of catching up for older funds. Many of the 3,000-plus funds are relatively new, and were set up with high management fees. **********Meanwhile, competitive pressures in the industry are intensifying. Investors are demanding better service. The technology and support needed are increasingly costly. **********So despite the push to increase margins, some of the new money is likely to flow back into the funds. A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said, \"I think that -- whether the funds know it or not -- they won't be able to take cash out of the business at the same rate as before, if they want to maintain their market share.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/06/business/company-earnings-mcdonnell-has-loss-and-cuts-payout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonnell Has Loss and Cuts Payout", "print_headline": "COMPANY EARNINGS; McDonnell Has Loss and Cuts Payout", "body_text": " **********The McDonnell Douglas Corporation lost $1 million in the fourth quarter and slashed its stock dividend for the first time in recent memory, company officials said today. **********The loss was expected, but the halving of the dividend to be paid to stockholders in April, to 35 cents from 70.5 cents, surprised some Wall Street analysts. **********The cut will save the struggling aerospace giant $13.6 million over the first three months of the year. **********\"It's a painful action for the company and shareholders, but hopefully it will convince everyone that there's a commitment to change,\" said Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.

New Rules Aim to Find Out", "print_headline": "Are Insurers Overly Risky? New Rules Aim to Find Out", "body_text": " **********Amid deepening public concern over the health of insurers, a new regulation now taking effect may help separate the financially strong from the shaky. **********The rule will require nearly all insurance companies for the first time to have their financial condition reviewed annually by an actuary -- a highly trained industry statistician -- to determine whether the insurer has enough money to pay claims and meet other financial obligations. If a company seemed weak, policyholders could get refunds of their unused premiums, and regulators could take remedial action before the insurer became insolvent. **********Life insurers already face this requirement, and state regulators are extending the rule to property and casualty insurers, which had been free to set thier financial reserves at whatever level they felt appropriate. **********The new rule is the latest attempt by insurance regulators to shore up an industry that has been buffeted by slumping commercial real estate values, plummeting prices for \"junk bonds\" and rapidly rising jury awards. Hard-hit insurers have been failing at an increasing rate, leaving many policyholders without coverage when they made a claim. **********Still, critics note that the new rule does not require an insurer to have an independent actuary certify whether its reserves are adequate. In fact, the actuary could be an employee. **********While the certification requirement should give consumers extra protection, it may well come at an extra cost. Right now, only midsized and giant insurers like Aetna, State Farm and Metropolitan Life, employ actuaries full time. Thousands of small companies, many of them family operated, will have to hire outside actuaries. That means their policyholders will probably end up paying that extra cost through higher premiums. **********The regulation, which was adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and cleared by state legislatures where necessary. covers property and casualty companies, which insure against a wide range of loss, including theft, fire and vandalism. Millions of the cars, homes and other property of millions of Americans are insured by these companies. Such companies also provide payments to injured employees through workers' compensation policies and cover industrial plants and equipment against loss. 'Early Warning System' **********\"You are not going to eliminate fraud or mismanagement,\" said James J. Murphy, executive vice president of the American Academy of Actuaries, the actuarial profession's trade group. \"But better monitoring by a responsible professional, such as an actuary, should give us a better early warning system.\" **********For property and casualty companies, the rule takes effect with their 1990 annual statements, which they are currently filing with state insurance commissioners. **********Advocates of the rules hope that policyholders will read an actuary's opinion in the insurer's annual report to see if an insurer has the financial wherewithal to pay probable claims. Based on this picture, policyholders could decide if they wanted to stay with that company or take their business elsewhere. Industry experts hope that at a minimum, the provision will limit policyholder losses if a company does become bankrupt. **********It is also hoped that the rule will slow the growth of many insurers because the amount of coverage an insurer may write in a year is tied to its reserves and capital base. The aim is to guard against runaway growth, which some experts fear could lead to a breakdown in financial controls. **********Finally, the new rule could lead many insurers to set premiums at a higher, healthier level as a means of bolstering their capital. **********Because individual states are responsible for regulating insurance, though they often coordinate their rules, the new rule actually takes the form of 50 individual state laws. The fact that property and casualty insurers were not subject to the same tougher financial oversight that applies to life insurers had left the public vulnerable and regulators with a big gap in their supervision. **********\"You could buy a property policy, you could pay the premium at the beginning of the year, and six months later that insurer could be gone,\" said Stephen P. Lowe, a specialist in insurance company reserves at Tillinghast, an actuarial consulting firm. **********Given the freedom to set their own level of reserves, many insurers greatly underestimated their obligations. Tillinghast studied 53 large insurers recently. It found that the $13.2 billion in reserves the companies had set aside by Dec. 31, 1984, were 20 percent too low by the end of 1987, based on the payouts the insurers had made. Over the 10 years ended 1986, Tillinghast said, the reserves of the same 53 insurers were too low each year by between 10 and 25 percent. **********\"If you don't stop an imprudent insurer fast enough, it can dig itself into a deeper hole,\" said Michael Walter, former president of the Casualty Actuarial Society, an organization for property and casualty actuaries. **********The new rule is already causing changes. Mr. Lowe said Tillinghast had told several clients to bolster their reserves after the actuaries conducted reviews. In the case of one midsized insurer, which he declined to identify, the company's net worth was cut in half before the actuary agreed to issue a favorable opinion. That insurer, which thought it would report a large profit for 1990, will report break-even results. Other actuarial consultants report similar experiences. **********While supporters of the new law view it as a boon to consumers, some experts point out problems. **********For example, unlike the certified public accountants who render opinions on the financial statements of public companies, the actuaries giving opinions on insurance company reserves will not have to be independent. The actuaries can even be on the payrolls of the insurance companies they are studying. That means an actuary working inside an insurance company could be pressured to render a favorable opinion. **********Actuarial profession officials argue that any actuary found to have compromised an opinion would be expelled from the field, but others acknowledge that the risk remains. Laws now being considered in several states would require that an independent actuary be appointed by the insurer's board of directors and that any insurer that changed actuaries report the change to its state insurance commissioner. **********The cost to some insurance companies could be substantial. **********\"If you are only making $500,000 a year in profit, I am not sure you can afford another $5,000 in consulting fees,\" said Armand DePalo, chief actuary of the Guardian Mutual Life Insurance Company.  Reserve Weakness **********As the number of insurance company insolvencies rose in recent years, industry experts have increasingly blamed inadequate reserves. A report last year by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations titled \"Failed Promises\" chronicled how five large property and casualty insurers became insolvent in the 1980's, leaving policyholders with substantial losses. The subcommittee identified insufficient reserves as a reason for the failures. **********\"I have seen company managements that are extemely capable in running their businesses fall down in this area,\" said Mr. Lowe of Tillinghast. \"Reserve-setting has been an Achilles' heel of insurers, particularly smaller ones.\" **********The old approach to setting reserves was inconsistent and made it hard for consumers to compare the financial strength of insurance companies. Management could make a company seem healthier by understating reserves. Understating reserves also helped bolster profits, since every dollar increase in an insurer's reserve cuts net income by an equal amount. **********But even actuaries warn against expecting too much from the new rules, given other pressures faced by insurers, like court orders to pay for pollution or asbestos cleanups. **********\"There are simply too many unknowns and there is too much risk involved for even a skilled actuary to say with great certainty what an insurer's final payments will be,\" said Mavis Walters, president of the American Academy of Actuaries. \"This is all a step in the right direction. But whether it will reduce insolvencies is anybody's guess.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/business/revlon-unit-to-sell-shares.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Revlon Unit to Sell Shares", "print_headline": "Revlon Unit to Sell Shares", "body_text": " **********National Health Laboratories Inc., a unit of Revlon Inc., said yesterday that it planned to sell 40 million shares to the public, which would raise $700 million at yesterday's market price. **********The sale will give Revlon even more money to reduce its debt.

So French Communists went ahead with their annual festival here this weekend as if they still had something to celebrate. **********There were bumper cars and other rides for the young, and scores of stands serving sausages, pates, wine and beer for others. Music blared from four stages and there were even a few tents given over to intense debates about everything from unemployment to immigration. **********There was also a speech from the perennial French Communist leader, Georges Marchais, who expressed sadness that the Soviet Union was borrowing the recipes of \"the most savage capitalism,\" but insisted, \"We carry the name 'Communist' with pride and see no reason to renounce it.\" **********And as in previous years, the crowds -- perhaps as many as a half-million people in two days -- flocked to La Courneuve Park outside Paris for what is known as the Fete de L'Humanite, so named because it is organized by the party's official newspaper, L'Humanite.  On the Slide for 15 Years **********Yet even the turnout could not shake the gloom of many Communists. \"People said this could be the last Fete de L'Humanite, that the end of Communism has come,\" Guy Poussy, a member of the party's Central Committee, said, \"so a lot of people may have come to look at an endangered species.\" **********The collapse of the Soviet Communist Party, however, is only the latest setback. Once one of the strongest in Western Europe, the French Communist Party has been on the slide for the last 15 years, as much a victim of France's prosperity as of its own failure to shake off its Stalinist past. **********From 1945 until the mid-1970's, the party routinely won 20 to 25 percent of the vote. By 1981 it was down to 16 percent, in 1988 it won only 11 percent and today polls give it 7 percent. No less dismaying, many former Communist supporters have switched their sympathy to the far-right National Front. **********\"We have to rebuild people's faith in themselves,\" Mr. Poussy went on. \"We have to involve the country's youth because there's a lot of despair. We have four million youths with terrible education and no hope of finding a job. There must be an alternative.\" **********Yet at the weekend fair, most young people barely glanced at stands decorated with the hammer and sickle as they headed for the fairground attractions or the daylong rock concerts. \"I'm not interested in politics,\" said a 20-year-old called Paul. \"I've just come to see my friends.\"  'Our Ideas Remain Valid' **********As the crowds swirled by, party loyalists with clipboards and membership forms tried to get passers-by to sign up, but only a handful even stopped to chat. \"One young man said he could never join the Soviet party but would give it a try here,\" one recruiter, Dominique Rethore, said. **********Many older people, in contrast, showed up because, they said, it was more important than ever to show their colors. \"The fascists have taken over in Moscow, but they won't last,\" Vicent Nickrass, a 61-year-old retiree from Somme, proclaimed confidently. \"The Communists remain Communists and they know what to do.\" **********Jean-Louis Fernandez, a gray-haired worker from a Paris suburb, said he would continue to vote Communist but admitted he was \"a bit disappointed\" by what had happened in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. \"But our ideas remain valid,\" his wife, Laure, chipped in. **********It was an argument that Mr. Marchais also used today. Yes, he conceded with a touch of mea culpa, \"crimes and errors\" had been committed in the name of Communism, but in a highly developed capitalist nation like France, \"the humanist values of Communism are still alive and relevant.\" **********Certainly, no one expects the French Communist Party to dissolve itself or change its name. In theory, growing unemployment and dissatisfaction with the Socialist Government of President Francois Mitterrand could even help the Communists. Yet, under Mr. Marchais, the party still seems trapped in the past. **********As change reached the Soviet Union in the late 1980's, for example, the 71-year-old leader could not hide his distaste for the changes introduced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, perestroika and glasnost. He even sounded relieved when Mr. Gorbachev was ousted on Aug. 19, although he hurriedly welcomed the coup's failure three days later. **********Not surprisingly, dissidence is growing. One group of reformers urged the Politburo to resign after its ambivalent response to the Soviet putsch. Charles Fiterman, a prominent liberal, has long campaigned against \"democratic centralism.\" Yet because he has not democratized the party, Mr. Marchais seems unlikely to be toppled. **********At the Fete de L'Humanite, party stalwarts could at least take refuge from the triumphant cries of French conservatives in recent weeks. And while many sat around trying to explain why Communism had imploded in the Soviet Union and why the French party continues to shrink, others seemed determined to have fun. **********In search of a theme for the fair, the editor of L'Humanite, Roland Leroy, chose solidarity with Cuba as perhaps the least likely to be controversial. Throughout the park, stands sold pins, posters and rum drinks to help finance a plan to send a boatload of food to Cuba. **********Indeed, the mood was cheerful enough for Mr. Marchais to announce confidently that another -- the 57th -- Fete de L'Humanite would be held next year.

Delta has a print ad that offers to cut fares by 70 percent for people who served in the gulf and their families for travel in the United States until Sept. 30. A recent print ad for Moet & Chandon champagne urged people to tear the ad up and throw the pieces in the air to celebrate the end of the war. **********Perhaps the most ambitious effort so far is a 30-second commercial jointly sponsored by General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union. The spot shows auto workers on the job and soldiers in the gulf region while one G.M. worker sings \"America the Beautiful.\" **********Howard Erickson, a spokesman for the U.A.W.-G.M. Human Resources Center, said the company and the union decided to run the ad to honor the hundreds of G.M. and union workers who served in the Middle East in the reserves. \"We considered that some people might perceive this as commercialism,\" Mr. Erickson said. \"But we don't think so, because the tone is just right and it focuses on people.\" **********Clint Rodenberg, senior vice president of marketing at Schieffelin & Somerset, which markets Moet champagne, said the Moet ad was celebrating peace, not victory. Mr. Rodenberg also said the ad had brought a positive public response. **********Executives at Delta did not return telephone calls seeking comment. **********Many executives said even ads that celebrated the end of the war would ultimately do more harm than good. For one thing, they said, there were millions of Americans who opposed the war. In addition, although it was a victory, more than 100 Americans died in the conflict and many were wounded. **********\"This was a war, and no matter what the outcome, any war is tragic,\" said Allan Beaver, the vice chairman and director of creative services at Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver. \"It is bound to turn off enough consumers to make it bad for business.\" **********Mr. Beaver said that one of his agency's clients, whom he would not identify, considered running an ad tied to the war, but that the agency convinced the company that it would be bad strategy. **********Some agency executives said that the only foolproof way for an advertiser to address the war in an ad would be to leave its name off as the sponsor. But if the company gets no credit, it serves no marketing point and most would reject the idea, agency executives said. **********While overtly patriotic themes may not work, some executives said advertisers could probably benefit from ads that talked about a renewed spirit in the country without referring to the war. \"There would be nothing wrong with running ads showing Americans feeling good about themselves and their country,\" said Patrick Cunningham, the chief creative officer at the Ayer agency. **********Some executives predicted that advertising might return somewhat to the kind of \"naive attitude\" that was prevalent in the 1950's. Mr. Deutsch said he expected to see a lot of ads with a \"Gee whiz, everything is going great\" theme. **********\"This is the first time in several decades we've had a reason to feel good about ourselves,\" he said. \"Now, 'Made in America' will mean something again.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/08/world/soviet-turmoil-tatars-seek-split-with-the-russians.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1991-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TATARS SEEK SPLIT WITH THE RUSSIANS", "print_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL; TATARS SEEK SPLIT WITH THE RUSSIANS", "body_text": " **********From an office decked with the green banners of Islamic solidarity, Rafael F. Mukhametdinov today surveyed the ruins of the Soviet Union with satisfaction: One empire down, he mused. One to go. **********With Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union in shards, Mr. Mukhametdinov, a Tatar separatist leader, has set his sights on the dismantling of Boris N. Yeltsin's Russian republic, itself a mosaic of ethnic homelands where the calls for independence have grown bolder with the weakening of Moscow's grip. **********Here in the Tatar Autonomous Republic, the most restive of the ethnic subdivisions that cover most of Russia's land mass, the cries for independence -- independence, that is, from Mr. Yeltsin -- have sent a shudder of anxiety through the large Russian population and marred the Russian President's moment of triumph.  Opposition to a Split **********\"The big empire has collapsed,\" said Mr. Mukhametdinov. \"The Russian federation will be more difficult, but I think it is inescapable that this empire will also collapse.\" **********So far, the clamor for secession here has been confined to nonviolent street rallies and the speeches of a few separatist political leaders. **********An outright split is strongly opposed by a pro-Yeltsin parliamentary faction grouped around the tiny Democratic Party of Russia and by the best-selling local newspaper, Vecherny Kazan. **********The Communist majority in the local Parliament has demanded greater self-rule, including the right to ignore laws and tax levies of the Russian republic, but stopped short of declaring full independence. **********\"The idea is not the collapse of the Russian federation, but a reformation,\" said Vasily N. Likhachev, Vice President of the Tatar Autonomous Republic. Annexed by Ivan the Terrible **********Mr. Yeltsin has promised to give the autonomous regions greater self-rule, including a bigger share of what they produce, but has insisted that the Russian federated republic remain \"one and indivisible.\" **********Like the Soviet Union, the Russian federation is a domain acquired by conquest and merger, and gerrymandered into ethnic autonomous entities -- 16 \"autonomous republics\" like this one and about a score of enclaves with lower status. **********Tatarstan, known in ancient times as the Khanate of Kazan, was annexed by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century as he pushed Russia's frontiers eastward. **********The autonomous entities contain much of the republic's natural wealth and industrial strength. Yakutia, in the far east, is rich in diamonds and gold. Komi, to the north, has coal. Bashkiria is a major source of natural gas. The Tatar Autonomous Republic has oil reserves and major industries like the Kamaz truck factory and the Ilyushin aircraft plant.  'A Big-Power Chauvinist' **********In most of those territories, the call for sovereignty has been muted by demographics. The local populations are often outnumbered by transplanted Russians. Tatarstan's population of 3.5 million includes about 48 percent ethnic Tatars, 43 percent Russians and a mix of other groups. **********But the crash of the Soviet center has shaken the equilibrium in Mr. Yeltsin's domain. **********For one thing, the ascendancy of Mr. Yeltsin has stirred longstanding resentments among non-Russians, not only in neighboring Soviet republics like the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, but in the minority enclaves within Russia. **********\"Yeltsin, to put it bluntly, is a demagogue and a big-power chauvinist,\" said Marat A. Mulukov, a history professor who is chairman of the Tatar Civic Center, the largest establishment of the nationalist groups.  Communists Court Nationalists **********Mr. Mulukov contends that Mr. Yeltsin and his followers have seized on the disarray in Moscow to suppress the yearnings of minorities and reimpose \"the Russian boot.\" **********Their indignation flared anew this week at the interim power-sharing arrangement negotiated by Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and other republics' leaders, a deal that gives only token representation to the autonomous entities. **********\"Tatarstan has more heavy industry than any of the three Baltic republics, more than Moldavia and Tadzhikistan,\" Mr. Mulukov said. \"The only reason we are not given equal status is Russian chauvinism.\" **********A second result of the failed coup is that the crumbling of the old Communist Party network has left local Communist leaders searching for new partners among the nationalists.  Awkward Spot During Coup **********Mintimer S. Shaimiyev, the Communist President of Tatarstan, found himself in an especially awkward spot. During the three days of the Moscow coup, he professed neutrality. The police in Kazan broke up a student demonstration supporting Mr. Yeltsin, and the director of the Communist-run printing plant censored newspapers that tried to publish Mr. Yeltsin's views. **********Before the failed coup, Tatar nationalists regarded Mr. Shaimiyev as a dubious ally, too cautious in his courtship of Moscow. But now that pro-Yeltsin forces are demanding his removal as a traitor, the nationalists have mobilized to defend him as a symbol of their sovereignty. **********\"Overnight they went from crying 'Down with Shaimayev!' to 'Hands off our President!' \" said Yelena N. Chernobrovkina, a reporter for Evening Kazan, who views the alliance as a maneuver by the Communist old guard to hold on to power. **********But Tatar leaders said they feared that the pro-Yeltsin forces would use Mr. Shaimiyev's wavering as a pretext to suppress their drive for self-rule.  Bolder Nationalist Movement **********\"They accuse us of uniting behind the conservative forces,\" Mr. Mukhametdinov said. \"It is true that Shaimiyev has not conducted himself like the ideal leader of a sovereign state. But at the moment that is where the power resides in the republic. We are uniting against a greater threat.\" **********Even before the upheavals in Moscow, the Tatar nationalist movement had been growing bolder and more influential. **********A year ago the Tatar Civic Center won a first victory when the Tatar Parliament declared its \"sovereignty,\" establishing the Tatar language along with Russian as equal \"official languages\" of the republic and asserting the supremacy of local laws over others. But the practical effects were minimal, as Tatarstan continued to abide by Soviet and Russian laws. **********More radical nationalist movements have sprung up to challenge the cautious Tatar Civic Center. **********Mr. Mukhametdinov, 44, is deputy chairman of Ittifaq, the National Independence Party, whose program calls for creation of a territorial army, the automatic right of resettlement here for the five million Tatars estimated to live elsewhere in the Soviet Union, and a vigorous educational campaign to discourage Tatar youngsters from marrying outside their race. Nearly a third of the marriages here are said to be mixed.  Ties to Turkic Republics **********\"What is the sense of struggling for equal rights if every third Tatar marries a Russian?\" said Mr. Mukhametdinov. \"In three generations we will die out as a nation, victims of biological assimilation.\" **********Mr. Mukhametdinov also is chairman of the Assembly of Turkic Peoples, an umbrella group of organizations across the Soviet Union sharing Turkic linguistic and cultural roots. **********While Mr. Yeltsin looks to the West for economic and political models, many Tatars argue that their natural allegiance is with Turkey and the Turkic-speaking Soviet republics like Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. **********\"If Russia is ruled as a federation of states without regard to nationality, like America, there can only be one result: the little nations will die out,\" said Mr. Mukhametdinov.  Cordial Ties to Russia **********As in other Eastern-oriented republics of the Soviet Union, nationalists here stress that this is a resurgence of Turkic nationalism, not Islamic fundamentalism. They advocate secular government, with no political role for Islam. **********The coup appears to have narrowed the distance between the radicals and more cautious Tatar groups. **********\"When we started out in 1988, our goal was to raise ourselves to the status of a full Soviet republic,\" said Mr. Mulukov of the Tatar Civic Center. \"Now we see that the union is finished, and the policies of Yeltsin give us no hope of receiving full independence within Russia. As part of Russia, we are doomed to be a second-class nation.\" **********The republic's government, while vowing to maintain cordial relations with Russia, has also become more insistent about escaping Russian control. One recent decree declared that all property on the territory of the republic, including the oilfields and factories run by Soviet and Russian ministries, now belong to the Tatars.  'A Boxcar Free of Goods' **********An economist who chairs the Tatar Parliament, Farit R. Gazizullin, said that in short order the republic plans to stop paying taxes to Mr. Yeltsin's Government. **********\"We pay Russia half a billion rubles a year in taxes,\" he said. \"We cannot accept that any longer.\" **********Regardless of its political status, he said, Tatarstan remains dependent on Russia for metal and other raw materials -- a point driven home the other day when an empty freight train pulled into Kazan Station painted with a sarcastic message from Russian steelworkers in the Ural Mountains: \"To free Tatarstan, a boxcar free of goods.\" **********The pro-Yeltsin forces argue that remaining within the Russian federation is essential to protect the rights of non-Tatars and to insure that the Communist old guard does not smother reforms aimed at greater democracy and free markets.  Anti-Russian Hostility **********\"If Tatarstan stays on the road of confrontation with Yeltsin, it can't be excluded that we will simply become a little island of national Communism in the sea of Russia,\" said Khasbulat K. Shamsutdinov, deputy editor of Vecherny Kazan. **********Rashid Akhmetov, a Tatar who heads the local branch of the Democratic Party of Russia, said: \"The revival of national identity is beautiful. But the idea of a national state is frightening.\" **********Most people of Russian heritage interviewed here said that they had seen no sign of Russian hostility against Russians and that they consider the potential for civic strife remote. But Russians said they live with growing uncertainty about their future. **********A few Russians have reportedly moved away to predominantly Russian regions, and others say they would consider leaving if the country's acute housing shortage did not make relocation so difficult. **********\"A lot of people would leave if they had relatives to put them up,\" said Rashit Sakhibdayev, 34, a city judge. \"But in this country it's not that easy to pick up and go.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/11/world/arriving-in-tokyo-baker-starts-3-nation-asia-tour.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 955, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arriving in Tokyo, Baker Starts 3-Nation Asia Tour", "print_headline": "Arriving in Tokyo, Baker Starts 3-Nation Asia Tour", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Tokyo today at the start of a politically risky Asian tour likely to determine whether relations between China and the United States remain strained or can begin to recover in the aftermath of Beijing's violent crackdown on democracy advocates in 1989. **********After stops in Japan and South Korea, Mr. Baker is to travel on Friday to Beijing in the highest-level visit by a Bush Administration official since the Tiananmen Square killings of June 1989. Although Mr. Baker's trip is going ahead as planned, President Bush last week responded to domestic political concerns by canceling a planned Asian tour beginning late this month. **********Administration officials say that secret contacts between Washington and Beijing have assured Mr. Baker that he will not leave China empty-handed or embarrassed. But it is far from certain that members of Congress will be satisfied with what he extracts from the Chinese in the key areas of arms control, human rights and trade.  Solarz 'Uneasy' **********\"I am uneasy with this trip,\" said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, and a leader of efforts to punish China for the crackdown. \"If Baker comes back and demonstrates that the trip was justified in the areas of our concern, fine. If he comes back as empty-handed as some others in the Administration before him, the trip will be rightly judged as not only a failure, but a mistake.\" **********Mr. Solarz argued that if Mr. Baker \"gives the present Chinese leadership gratuitous legitimacy\" without getting anything substantial in return, the debate over the Administration's China policy will likely be rekindled. An unimpressive result might also give new impetus to efforts to strip China of \"most-favored-nation\" trading benefits, which the Administration renewed in June.  Movement Is Seen **********An Administration expert involved in planning the trip said, \"The Chinese have been doing some things -- not in the human rights area -- in a direction which we see as more positive than negative and we would like to encourage them to continue that movement. **********\"Look, everyone has mixed feelings about this trip,\" the official added. \"I supported it because you cannot talk credibly about Asia, about Japan becoming a regional power, about the future security architecture in Asia and leave China unattended. It is too important. You avoid China at your peril.\" **********Chinese leaders, the official said, \"will want the maximum to give themselves face out of this visit. They will limit their cooperation in the absence of such meetings in order to get that. You go into it aware of that, and it is just a question of how you deal with it.\" **********Bush Administration officials cite several areas where they contend the Chinese are moving in the right direction. The first is their agreement in principle to sign the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. Others include Beijing's limited cooperation on Middle East arms control -- which primarily involves not yet delivering missiles contracted for by Syria -- and its commitment in principle to join the Missile Technology Control Regime. Finally, on Sept. 23, the Chinese agreed to begin talks on assuring Washington that it will not export to the United States goods produced by prison labor.  Cooperation With Iran **********And then there are the areas where Washington will try to prevent further deterioration, like China's increasing nuclear cooperation of with Iran. **********What Mr. Baker will apparently try to win from the Chinese is some sort of ironclad commitments not to sell nuclear technology to countries like Iran, Syria or Pakistan, nor any ballistic missiles. Even if the Chinese sign the treaty controlling missile technology, the question is how closely they will abide by it. The treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons is before the Chinese legislature and the Chinese authorities are saying it must be passed there first, although the regime could push it through any time. **********\"The Chinese are very good at appearing to make concessions and then not doing it,\" said a Congressional staff expert on China. \"That is why the assurances have to be ironclad.\" **********Because so many other issues have captured the headlines in recent years, American trade problems with China have been largely lost from view, but they are extremely serious. To control inflation in recent years the Chinese have clamped down tightly on imports, devalued their currency and erected import-license trade barriers to support their state-owned enterprises -- including those that depend on prison labor. This has led to diminished American exports to China and a trade defict in 1990 of about $10.5 billion.  Talks on Market Access **********The United States is already engaged in negotiations with the Chinese over market access. Another yardstick for the success or failure of Mr. Baker's trip will be the extent to which it can speed up these negotiations. **********The area where Congress will be most closely watching Mr. Baker's trip, however, will be in the field of human rights. Legislation that would strip China of its preferential trading status is now on hold in Congressional committees; whether the legislation is revived will depend in part on how many political prisoners the Chinese release amonng those arrested since the 1989 crackdown. **********Amnesty International estimates that there are roughly 800 such political prisoners, and Congressional experts hope that half will be freed, including some prominent dissidents. **********Before Mr. Baker visits Beijing, he will be making his inaugural stopover in Seoul, the South Korean capital. **********The most pressing issue now on the Korean-American agenda, say American officials, is what can be done about quickening pace of North Korea's nuclear arms program. Some experts believe North Korea is only 6 to 12 months away from producing a bomb."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/business/business-people-pogo-producing-picks-a-successor-to-liedtke.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1991-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pogo Producing Picks A Successor to Liedtke", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Pogo Producing Picks A Successor to Liedtke", "body_text": " **********The Pogo Producing Company, an oil and gas exploration and production concern founded by the oilman William C.

Pogo showed a profit of $18.2 million last year, compared with a $5.6 million loss in 1989. \"At the same time we've halved our debt of $515 million and kept our overhead low,\" he said. \"During the boom days in the oil patch, we, like many others, had a much larger staff.\" **********The staff has been reduced to 101 from 240, Mr. Van Wagenen said, and will probably stay at that level. \"We seem to function best as a lean, mean group of oil finders,\" he said. **********Mr. Van Wagenen made his reputation as a Pogo lawyer, fighting the company's battles in court to make gas purchasers pay up.

Gorbachev said he badly needs credits from the West for his latest reform plan to work. But that request comes at a time when the West is hard pressed for the cash. No matter. To get the money, Mr. Gorbachev wants to take his flip charts to the July economic summit meeting of industrialized countries in London. But the bets are that if he goes, he won't come back with much. Western economists looking at the latest plan are not impressed. \"It's anarchic,\" said Marshall Goldman of Harvard University. \"There is no provision for a convertible ruble. And Gorbachev, as late as November, did not support private property.\" The plan allows state-owned enterprises to sell 10 percent of their goods on the open market. Not good enough. \"Since November 1989, I counted eight reform plans,\" said Mr. Goldman. Most were abandoned. \"Too bad the Soviet Union can't produce products the way it produces plans,\" he said. A Tower of Power for Sony?  Few buildings convey corporate power as convincingly as A.T.& T.'s granite-clad headquarters in Manhattan. It was completed in 1983, weeks before the telephone monopoly was broken up by the government. Trouble is, while the breakup made the American Telegraph and Telephone Company smaller -- it shed the eight \"baby bells\" -- the size of the building remained the same. Now, A.T.& T. is planning to lease its tower to the Sony Corporation. And Sony will get an option to buy it. While the building may be too expensive for A.T.& T., Sony is flush with cash. Sales were up 25 percent for the year, and profits climbed 13.7 percent, it reported last week.  A Trade Pact on the Fast Track  It was a big victory for the Administration. The House and Senate approved a renewal of the fast-track legislation Mr. Bush so anxiously sought. The legislation gives the Administration the power to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and present it to Congress for approval with a simple yea or nay vote. Congress cannot haggle over the fine points. The deal could be completed within a year. \"I couldn't be more pleased,\" Mr. Bush said.  Buying Jet Parts from Japan . . .  In times past, Boeing's main suppliers were American. That is changing. The Boeing Commercial Airplane Company signed an agreement last week with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries to help it build major parts of the 777, its newest twinjet. Boeing's new partners will make 20 percent of the plane and shoulder some of the investment risk. But eyebrows are being raised. With commercial aviation targeted for growth by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Investment, is Boeing about to create its newest rivals? No, says Boeing. It will only show its partners plans for the parts they actually build. But what will the partners show each other? . . . and Selling G.M. There  Toyota and the General Motors Corporation teamed up once before.  Now, if the rumors are true, they will do it again. Toyota is thinking about selling G.M.'s cars in Japan through its dealer outlets. G.M. needs the help, too. Last year, it sold just 8,513 cars in Japan -- not many more than its sells on a good day at home. Trading Criticisms on Trade  Japan and the United States have been arguing about trade for decades. Last week, they gave each other report cards, and both received failing grades. Japan's negotiators complained that American companies pay their chief executives too much and that the Federal budget deficit is still too high. Japan begrudgingly gave credit to the United States for getting serious about education. America's negotiators were also upset. Japan is still a closed market, they said, with companies bound to each other through ties of ownership and seats on each other's boards of directors. But the Americans admitted that Japan has changed some of its distribution system. Both opinions have merit. But it is hard to figure out what some of these issues have to do with trade. A Joint Venture by Rivals  Last week, when Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Company bought a German drug company, Woelm Pharma G.m.b.H., a subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, for $90 million, it showed that rivals at home can be strategic partners abroad. They bought Woelm in a 50-50 joint venture they call the Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company. (How will they fit that on the bottle?) The new acquisition will give the two companies access to Europe's $5 billion over-the-counter market. And they will get European manufacturing capacity, too. Woelm also has a distribution network that could help the companies push their way into Europe. But perhaps most important, by acquiring Woelm they now have expertise in getting new drugs past Europe's regulators, a definite advantage. Both companies are planning to sell over-the-counter versions of their prescription drugs there. More European acquisitions by the joint venture may be on the horizon. A spokesman said they are \"studying additional opportunities.\" COMPANIES **********A Fallen Insurer Is on the Block How much is a failed insurance company worth? That is what the regulators in California want to know. Last week, they put the assets of Executive Life Insurance Company on the block. The regulators, who seized the company last month after it defaulted on its portfolio of high-yield \"junk bonds,\" are proposing to divide Executive Life into two units, each to be sold separately. One unit would include the policies along with some of the bonds. The other would get the leftover assets, which the buyer could sell. Altus Finance, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, has stepped forward to examine the books. One problem the regulators still have not solved: Executive Life owes $643 million in back taxes. Basic Research at Microsoft  William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest publisher of personal computer software, thinks his company could get by without doing any research at all. Just buy what it needs from innovative software companies and university research labs. Still, it can't take chances. Microsoft announced it will open a basic research center at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., to develop software to manipulate images, understand human speech and -- yes -- help scientists design new software. Where will Microsoft get its scientists? From rivals like I.B.M. The lab is not intended to become huge. Microsoft will spend just $10 million a year. Stocks Around the Clock  The Big Board's volume is up, but it has been losing market share to regional and even foreign stock exchanges, some of which trade 24 hours a day. So the Big Board petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it stay open later. Last week the S.E.C. agreed. In a phase-in program, the Big Board will take a slow stroll to a 24-hour trading day. Starting June 13, the 9:30 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. trading day will be extended to 5 P.M. for individual stocks and 5:15 P.M. for large baskets of stocks. Within a decade, the Big Board will be open around the clock. The impact of the new rules \"will be felt around the world,\" said Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C. More Paring at Apple For Apple Computer Inc., the future is clear. The company must increase its market share and pare its costs. Apple already cut the prices of the Macintosh. Sales jumped. Now comes the hard part: trimming its work force by 10 percent.  THE ECONOMY **********Good News and a Dash of Salt  At first glance, more good news. The sale of durable goods -- those big ticket items that are supposed to outlast their warranties -- grew by 2.9 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department. It was the first increase of the year. But sales were down in one crucial category -- nondefense capital goods. Sales of trucks, trains and machine tools fell by 10.3 percent, a signal that the nation's factories are not investing. \"That's a bad sign,\" said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to DRI Inc., an economic consulting firm. \"You can't take these numbers as evidence that we've turned the corner.\" Prepaid Tickets for Speeders? The Texas State Legislature began a debate last week on a novel way to raise revenue. Sell speeding tickets in advance, the proposed bill says. The plan calls for books of five speeding tickets to be sold by the state motor vehicle department for $25. If you get stopped by the police for doing between 55 miles per hour and 70 m.p.h., just give the officer a pre-paid ticket. Nothing goes on your record. But if you get stopped for doing more than 70 m.p.h., the officer gives you the ticket -- the old-fashioned kind. That one goes on your record. The Legislature figures it will raise $100 million a year selling penalties in advance. It could even broaden which penalties are for sale. The Deficit Swells as Taxes Rise  Back in 1986, when the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law took effect, the deficit was $221 billion. Much too high. What followed were five years of wrangling and political debate. Then, last fall, Congress and the Administration raised taxes and vowed to cut the deficit. Last week the fruits of their labors were unveiled: a $1.45 trillion budget for 1992 with a 1 percent drop for the military.But the estimated deficit increased to $278.8 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/27/world/soviet-turmoil-debate-parliament-gorbachev-takes-enormous-share-blame.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 7776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debate in Parliament: Gorbachev Takes 'an Enormous Share' of the Blame; Legislators Speak Out: 'We Have the Spirit of Reaction in this Assembly'", "print_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL; Debate in Parliament: Gorbachev Takes 'an Enormous Share' of the Blame; Legislators Speak Out: 'We Have the Spirit of Reaction in this Assembly'", "body_text": " **********Following are key sections of the session of the Supreme Soviet yesterday, including a speech by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and speeches by other Supreme Soviet members. The speech by Nursultan A. Nazarbayev was transcribed and translated by The New York Times and the BBC monitoring service; all others were translated by CNN and transcribed by Reuters.  GORBACHEV'S SPEECH **********Distinguished members of the Supreme Soviet: first of all, I would like to support the decision adopted by the Supreme Soviet to convene an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies, because the problem itself and everything we have gone through over the last days and the decisions that are necessary are all the prerogatives of the Congress. And this is the first thing I wanted to say. **********And then I would like to suggest the following thing: that is to invite members of the Russian Parliament and members of other parliaments to attend the session of the Congress. **********In the period remaining, I would request that the people's deputies working in commissions and committees in different chambers and groups of deputies to discuss and analyze everything that has happened and the reason for that and to draw appropriate conclusions. What is needed is not just philosophizing but specific and concrete decisions and actions, which must be based on accurate and uncompromising analysis of everything we have gone through. **********Naturally enough, in the buildup to the Congress, we will not remain idle. In fact, we have begun our work and we have raised the matter of nonconfidence in respect of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet of Ministers did not live up to the challenge and actually participated in the coup. The decree on the departicization of troops and the K.G.B. has been adopted. **********People have been removed from the key positions in the army -- I mean those who sided with the plotters. New people have been put in key positions. The office of the Procurator General of the U.S.S.R. and the Russian Federation is currently conducting a criminal investigation into the coup. **********You are familiar with the declaration I made earlier. I resigned from the post of the General Secretary of the Communist Party and I suggested that the Central Committee of the Communist Party should disband itself. Similar measures and these specific measures are necessary to defuse tensions in the country and we will unswervingly pursue this policy in the future. Signs of Impending Coup **********In this statement that I am making -- this is not a report, this is just a statement because a report would need much more preparation and we need to consult with each other before I make a report. But for the time being, I would like to dwell on the most important issues. **********Distinguished deputies, the coup was not entirely unexpected. It was not a bolt from the blue. It was prepared by the provocative statements of certain generals and people in key positions and certain statements made in the Supreme Soviet, and there were attempts to undermine the decisions. And the coup was impending and appropriate steps were necessary to protect the constitutional order in the country. However, that had not been done, although we did draw appropriate conclusions and we rebuffed those attempts in the Supreme Soviet, in the press and elsewhere. **********However, instead of decisive actions, there was lack of determination, and I am also responsible for that lack of determination. But this is one conclusion that must be drawn from that situation. There is another cause for the attempt to push the country toward totalitarianism and that is lack of decision in the implementation of democratic reforms, particularly in those structures that spearheaded the coup. And this is not only my responsibility but the responsibility of the Supreme Soviet, the party and the Government. **********Our good intentions and plans were not implemented because the old mechanism and the old structure of power had not been changed. And I mean primarily the state apparatus, which was totally in agreement with the policy of the party and there were people in key positions who remained loyal to the Stalinist doctrine. We vacillated for a long time and even at this moment, we have not embarked on the road of decisive transformation. **********This has affected the sociopolitical situation in the country. In fact, the plotters wanted to take advantage of the difficulties in the country and it is true that the people of the country are facing a very difficult situation. There's a slump in living standards. The criminality is on the rise. And the overall situation is deteriorating. **********There's another reason for the coup and that is there was lack of coordination between the forces of perestroika, between different groups of democratic forces. We were divided. And both in the session of the Congress and at plenary meetings, I used to say again and again that if we are committed to democracy and democratic movement, it would be a major mistake if we get involved in a political struggle. **********However, there was a lack of political vision and a lack of responsibility for our common cause. I mean the democrats first and foremost. Without appropriate constitutional supervision, the army was in a very difficult situation. However, the plotters failed to plunge the army into the struggle against its own people, and those were the major miscalculations on the part of the plotters. Troops Refuse to Attack **********They believed, and I apologize for the languages I'm using, but they believed that they could manipulate the people. However, the country had changed, and that was a major mistake on their part. The country had changed. The people had changed and the army had changed, because the army is a part of the people. And even those forces in the army that had been trained for emergency situations and contingency situations, for anti-terrorist activities, refused to take actions against the people. **********Although they were threatened with court-martial, they refused to participate in the coup. Airborne troops refused to participate. And you know the actual capability of airborne troops. Just three planeloads would have been enough to remove the Government from power. **********And those people who took the troops into the streets of Moscow refused to participate in the coup, and this is another major cause for the failure of the coup. However, troops were out in large numbers in the streets of Moscow. There were tanks in the streets. And those actions were taken without an appropriate approval on the part of the legislature. That means that the mechanism of power is not functioning properly. **********The K.G.B. had not been reorganized. It is true that the K.G.B. protects the interests of the state, using its intelligence agencies, but the K.G.B. remained an instrument of political struggle, despite the changes that have been made. **********The Supreme Soviet failed to move and members of the Cabinet of Ministers panicked and failed to take action  [ change of interpreter ]  face of the committee. All of this helped. But I, as President, bear an enormous share of the responsibility for this. I say this because during these days, a lot has become clear to me. I have drawn a lot of different conclusions from what has happened to us. **********They seem to say that I've come to a different country. I could even add another country in the sense -- the way that I look at various problems, such as human rights, and I look at the future also with other eyes. **********In any case, no oscillations and no delays will be accepted in carrying out these reforms as long as I am President. No more compromises with those who -- your applause I accept to mean that you are not willing to accept any compromises. Although my main desire was that everything we do should lead to democracy, and this supported my position -- and this is perhaps what helped me avoid doing anything that would have led our country to a catastrophe. **********One other reason that made the process of reform so painful and -- the party bureaucratic structures have -- I recall how in the Central Committee meeting there was some struggle against those who were trying to block the democratic transformations. The old system was already undermined, disorganized, but it continued to hang on and it tried to prevent the transformations from being carried out. Soviet Society's Changes **********Its -- we -- indeed, initially I thought it was possible to separate the millions of party members from the leadership. Indeed, the belief of many members of the party inspired me with hope that we would be able to have a genuine transformation and reorganize the party along contemporary lines. But this coup d'etat made it no longer possible for me to think this way. And I thought it was my duty as Secretary General and urged the Central Committee to dissolve itself for that reason. **********Even so, despite all of these reasons that made the plot possible, it was nonetheless condemned from the very beginning to failure. The last six years have shown that we did not live them in vain. We can no longer recognize how the country has changed. New democratic forces have emerged. These coup leaders didn't understand this, and maybe we also don't understand each other all the time, but nonetheless we have become able to deal them a crushing blow. **********This conclusion is directly linked to why the plotters hastened so rapidly to carry out their plans. I can state with full conviction that they understood that any delay was fatally dangerous to them because such processes were emerging, such as the nine-plus-one process we're engaged in. And not only in the party Central Committee, but even in the Supreme Soviet, we will understand that -- we have fully understood that process. And these days, we have to say everything sincerely and openly, because we are all here together and the country is behind us. **********That's -- in signing the union treaty and undertaking the transition to a market, the meeting of the E.E.C. is going to make it possible to be integrated into the world economy unless this coup failed and it was crushed. I would like once again to express my unlimited gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of Muscovites who came out into the streets, fearlessly confronting machine guns and tanks to defend legality. **********An enormous role here was played by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, the inhabitants of Leningrad and their leaders, and also the peoples of the other republics. **********The country did not accept -- however they tried to package their appeal to the people, the country would not accept what they had to say. And in these very difficult circumstances, people took -- were willing to accept decisive measures but not any kind of measure. At the same time, the very fact that the coup was possible is evidence that we are still only halfway there, and we have to take other urgent measures to create guarantees of constitutional legality. **********What shall we do next now? First of all, I feel it very important to immediately renew the process of signing the union treaty. The plotters were able to undermine this process. This was one of the main aims, unfortunately.  The Union Treaty **********A number of the decrees of this so-called Emergency Committee included decrees by the President of the Supreme Soviet Lukyanov, as we found out later immediately handed over to the information media, in which he tried to show that the union treaty should not be signed. **********The draft treaty is a balance of the interests of all participants. Of course, it could be improved here and there, but the main thing is, and here I agree with those proposals that have been made these recent days and the statement by the leadership of the Russian Federation and certain meetings, certain proposals made in Leningrad and other republics that we have to sign the treaty and not delay its signing any longer. **********The fact that it can be improved, this can be done by addenda and by protocols and thereby we will be acting on the basis of the people's will as expressed in a referendum. **********In meetings with the leaders of the nine republics on Aug. 23, after my return, I understood that the union treaty has got to be signed as quickly as possible. In the meantime, certain steps have been taken, but we are not talking only about the final step in the transformation of our society but only the first step. **********Second point: we have to take the attitude with respect to those republics who don't want to sign the treaty. They have to be given the right to make their own choice. After signing the treaty we have to start business discussions with those who want to leave the union. **********The preparatory work can be done here and now. The agreement with them has got to contain all guarantees of the observation of human rights, regardless of their ethnicity. We have to solve the question of compensating those citizens who don't want to remain outside the union but want to join it, the question of the military infrastructure, where it has to be retained for a certain period of time on the territory of those republics which have separated from the union. **********At the same time, considering the vital interests of all 15 republics in maintaining economic ties, we have to start to work on concluding economic agreements, and this has to be done here and now, immediately. **********In the third place, we have immediately to solve certain questions of how the country is going to be governed until the new constitution is accepted. This has to be done right now. We have to have elections to solve some major questions such as the election of the new U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, a new vice president. We must consult with each other very assiduously on this. **********At the meeting with the leaders of the republics on the 23d of August, a proposal was made to have an authoritative body that can adopt coordinated decisions on all major questions relating to the whole Soviet Union. I'm talking about administration or government now.  New Soviet Laws **********It was proposed that we use the constitutional body known as the Security Council, which doesn't yet exist. And we have to enhance the significance of this body in its makeup and its competence. This can be done if the leaders of the republics enter it, those republics that have decided to sign the union treaty -- Comrades Bakatin, Primakov, Popov, Revenko,  [ GRIGORY I., a member of the presidential council ]  and others. **********We have to form on the basis of agreement with the other republics a cabinet of minsters of the U.S.S.R., although a decision has already been taken to form such a group with Comrade Silayev. **********In the fourth place, the plotters would not have been able to carry out their plans if on their path there had been a firm Supreme Soviet with its president. Therefore, we have to convoke the Supreme Soviet immediately. This was done immediately in Russia. This played an enormous role in blocking the coup d'etat. But at this moment the republics in the Supreme Soviet were not able to carry out their rights and responsibilities. **********Now why this did not happen, why they did not come to the capital immediately, this is something we have to think about. We can draw all sorts of lessons from this, not only moral and political ones but we have got to be able to insure that this will not occur again. **********What kind of formulation do we need in the Constitution or in the law? We'll have to think this one over also. I propose that those delegates here give some thought -- who is going to be the president of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. **********I'm ready for consultations on this, am always, but in particular today. None of us should leave anything unresolved. We've got to act together and with the leaders of the republics so that there'll be total confidence and total understanding and total awareness that the job will be done as it must be done. In the fifth place, necessary to evaluate the situation and establish social control over the activity of the armed forces. **********Here major transformations are necessary. First of all, we have to do everything to make sure that today, during the work on the constitution there'll be military reform as well. And then this will become a major part of the new law on military reform. **********We've got to increase the professional makeup of the army. We have to reorganize the Committee of State Security. My decree of naming Comrade Bakatin as president of the committee has a second paragraph urging him to reorganize the whole system of state security. **********We have to erect a barrier against any possibility of abuse of the security organs against the constitution. **********I will sign a decree on the troops out of the Ministry of Defense. It's also necessary to suspend the activity of the law on the K.G.B., to work out a new conception of state security, and reform it accordingly. And  [ inaudible ]  economic measures. In view of the cardinal changes in the country, we have to revise existing laws. At the forthcoming session of the Supreme Soviet, let us discuss this and work out measures on our future economic policy, considering everything that we -- considering the fact that we are now in new circumstances after these events. Economics and Republics **********We have to do everything possible, and on my part, I will -- we should not be too hasty, but we have to proceed deliberately. At the same time I take on myself the responsibility of saying something about this. First of all, measures must include elimination of all blocks created by the old structures and the old people on the path to a market economy. We have to eliminate all obstacles to this. And we have to accelerate the creation of the necessary market institutions. **********We have to move the center of gravity of the economic decisions to the republican level, maintaining the, on the union government insuring a unified economic area.  [ Inaudible ]  cardinal change in our financial and creditary policy is necessary. Measures have to be taken to combat the budgetary deficit and to assure the money supply. All obstacles have got to be eliminated that prevent land from being granted to those who want to cultivate it. **********We have plenty of land. We have several million such farmers, but that is not the end of it. We have to insure that there be a genuine land reform, so that this land reform shall get the necessary oxygen, and for this it needs our support. **********Of course we have to collect the harvest, but there's -- there will be plenty to think about afterward, in the autumn. We have to organize a whole foreign trade, our trade with hard-currency countries. We're going to need to increase the economic assistance we get from Western countries. I've had negotiations with the main Western countries, and they have confirmed that due to the fact that the last events of recent days have convinced them that the Soviet Union has now set about reforms which are irreversible, and they understand the necessity of cooperating, and increasing this cooperation. **********Social policy should go, be conducted with less demagogy in carrying out our program. We've got to get away from economic fatalism. We've got to concentrate attention on the major questions of social defense of the workers, supporting their living standard, and in particular of the, those who are less well-provided for. And an acute issue, in particular, is the food and fuel question. **********Proposals to remedy this have been prepared in the republics, and we have to think about that, too. We cannot permit a breakdown in the supply of food and fuel to the population. **********Even from this rostrum, I want to take this opportunity to appeal to our peasants and to all inhabitants of our countryside, all of our miners, all of those working in the power industry, to stick to their jobs until we have succeeded in solving all of these main issues. **********The Committee on the Economy has been set up by me, and it has to concentrate its efforts primarily on these problems, because all these problems are interlinked. **********In the seventh place, after signing the union treaty we have to start an electoral campaign for elections to the Supreme Soviet, including the President. These are measures that in my view we have -- this is what we have learned from the events of the last days, and this campaign has to be worked up very closely. Committees of the Supreme Soviet have to deal with this in a business-like way and furthermore, they have to give thought to control mechanisms to insure that the election is carried out legally, and they have got to have all of our support. **********This is all I felt it necessary to tell you in this statement of mine, which I have prepared in the wake of these recent events. **********Everybody is expecting decisions and business from us, and I think that the Supreme Soviet, and all of us have to do everything possible to insure that legality and order should continue. That means that all of those who are participating in -- participated in the coup d'etat have got to be dealt with as the law provides. But on the other hand, at this moment, we and the democratic forces of the country, and the whole people are opposed to any arbitrary actions that would simply compromise and endanger everything we are doing now.  LEVON TER-PETROSYAN Armenian President **********Distinguished deputies, dear guests, I came up to this rostrum to make a short statement. It seems to me that I regret that we are being led away from the most crucial problem of this moment. And the most crucial problem of the current moment is not the assessment of what has happened and not the consequences, but the most crucial problem at the moment is what will happen to the center, what will happen to the union parties in power. **********It seems to me that the central authorities after this coup have been outdated. The center is dead. The center has committed suicide. And to reanimate this cadaver now would mean to get back to the danger of the catastrophe that we had. **********As I have been listening to the debate at the Supreme Soviet, it seems to me that the Supreme Soviet is not yet ready to seriously discuss this problem. That is why I think it's too early for me to speak. I'll speak before you at the Congress. . . .  YURI N. SHCHERBAK  Ukrainian Journalist **********Dear Comrades: please, I'd like to draw your attention to the draft resolution. We don't have the editorial group yet, but we'll elect it. There are several questions here and we put those in the work now. **********Five years after the atomic catastrophe, we have to live through a political Chernobyl. The resolutions and decrees of the Emergency Committee smelled of threats. And these decrees showed like an X-ray machine who is who, and we now know what could have happened if the plotters could have gotten access to the nuclear trigger. **********So in the Chernobyl catastrophe it was Block No. 4 that fell down, was ruined, and in 1991, it was not Chernobyl, but the Stalinist empire that collapsed. . . . **********The Ukrainian Parliament has ruled that the Ukraine will be an independent because on Aug. 19, 1991, it was threatened by the state coup of losing its independence. As the state now has the right to self-determination and this has been written down in U.N. and other international documents. **********So the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet or Parliament has declared the emergence of an independent state, the Ukraine. The Ukraine will have only its own laws and its own constitution and on December the 1st there will be a general referendum in the Ukraine, and we'll see what the people will decide. **********I'd like to tell you that 15 deputies, a group from the Ukrainian Parliament, and I hope that others will join in, as the citizens of the Ukraine have spoken in favor of an independent Ukraine. Then we are planning to set up our own National Guard and we envisage some other measures for political and economic sovereignty. **********We have been assessing the coup and the consequences it may have for Russia and the Ukraine. The people's deputies from the Ukraine have stated that the events of Aug. 19-21 have shown that the central Government is inconsistent, and Gorbachev included, and the present government bodies have no power to protect the security of peoples, and there are such uncontrollable structures as the C.P.S.U., the Communist Party, and the Ukrainian branch. **********By the way today they told me that in one of the headquarters of the Ukrainian head party they had found a note, an official document in favor, in support of this coup. I'm talking about the Ministry of Defense. . . . And there were a number of Soviet officials who backed the coup. For example, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union heard more than one threat to carry out a coup. **********In May 1991, I wrote an article, a requiem for the Parliament, and I said that Gorbachev and Lukyanov are like Mozart and Salieri. But today I would compare them to Christ and Judas. . . . And I think we should remember that there were deputies here threatening the President all the time and let's get back to the protocols and read them. . . . Remember, Colonel  [ inaudible ] , Petroshenka and many others. . . . **********And now it is becoming clear that we should take another stand in respect to the union treaty. There can be three kinds of ties between the sovereign republics. First, they can be bound in one state. Second, the sovereign republics sign a union treaty with the state. And third, they just sign economic, military, ecological and other agreements between each other, being sovereign. **********From this point of view there can be no one state but the point is now to avoid bloodshed and to avoid the changing of borders and take into consideration the  [ unintelligible ]  and his experience instead of using the centrist structures here. I think that we should create a Eurasian community or something like the NATO and so on. Only these kinds of unions will give us peace, stability and security  [ unintelligible ]  the world. Thank you.  KONSTANTIN M. OBOROK  Moldavia Council Chairman **********People have been arguing that the tricolor of Russia should be retained as the national flag of the country. We have a particular problem in that we are committing an immoral act. The K.G.B. was instrumental in implementing the coup. However, I'm not going to speak about Lukyanov, but I called one of the deputies on Monday and I asked what was going on, and I was told that everything was under control, that the constitutional bodies were in place, everything was quiet. . . . **********In conclusion, let me say that we have the spirit of reaction in this assembly, and many members of this Parliament are reluctant to implement the reforms. **********I would like to say a prayer for Boris Yeltsin and Russian Parliament. VLADIMIR P. SHCHERBAKOV  Chairman, Moscow Trade Union Council **********We indulged in wishful thinking when we thought that our Constitution could protect the constitutional order and democracy. The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is called on to give answers to the following questions. **********What were the deep-rooted causes of the coup and what needs to be done now? **********One of the causes was the political, social, and economic crisis. **********Our people are suffering, there's a lack of power at every level, both executive, legislative, and judicial. **********Mikhail Sergeyevich, let me tell you that the replacement of Ryzhkov, and your special powers, did not help to change the situation in the country. **********Another root cause of the crisis is lack of democracy and lack of political culture in the country. As a result of that, a small group of apparatchiks believed that they could stage a coup, they thought that they were saving this country. This is easy to condemn, the plotters, and say to the people that the old system would be dismantled. **********On the 23d of August, the presidium analyzed the situation and therefore, today, we speak from the position formulated by the presidium. **********First of all, it is necessary to deal with the question of power in this country. This session should deal with the following issues: The formation of a new union government that would take this country through the period of transition. We believe Boris Yeltsin has suggested a very good idea of setting out a government of national reconciliation. **********Next, it is necessary to identify the deadlines for the election of the parliament and the president of the country. . . . **********In order to defend our democracy and to hold a genuinely democratic general election, we need to set up a united democratic front. **********As a first step, we need to organize a round table, and the Supreme Soviet must initiate the formation of such a round-table discussion. **********Mikhail Gorbachev promised to discuss the urgent measures such as food, energy, et cetera, and this is our top priority. **********People have got to know how he's going to be fed and how he's going to be heated. **********Finally, during the last three days there has been a greater change in people's consciousness than over the previous six years. The people have changed. We should not -- should we not make a use of this change in order to implement our economic reforms? The new consciousness needs a new economy. The people should become the bosses of their own factories and of their own country. **********Thank you.  ANATOLY A. SOBCHAK  Mayor of Leningrad **********Dear colleagues, I would like when I ask for the floor to speak from this rostrum about all the mistakes that we made and the reasons that with our connivance led to a coup d'etat, but today I have decided to talk about something else. **********I want to tell our distinguished colleague that all of the discussion here today leaves a very burdensome impression on me. We're talking about who is trying to distort his real position and make himself look better than he was. But let me talk about something else. **********Today we have before us perhaps the most favorable situation, the most favorable conditions for rapidly progressing forward in our political and economic reforms. **********For six years we have, our whole reform has been hindered by the Communist structures. For six years, every attempt that we had to move away from that center was blocked by the fact that the whole system of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. as a part of the state structure delayed and put the brakes on any reforms we tried to attempt. **********Today finally we have an opportunity to remove those shackles and we have the opportunity now to move forward, and what do we hear? I'm most concerned, more than anything else, at the tendency I hear to try to deprive the country of its governing bodies. People are saying we don't need any kind of unified all-union authority. We're hearing that everything has to be liquidated, that all independents exist at the republican level, et cetera, et cetera. **********There are two sources of danger here. First of all, Nursultan Nazarbayev, a man whom I greatly love and respect, a man who I worked with in Tbilisi in the old days -- and even then I had great respect for him and for his position of principle and honor -- but today when I heard his statement I thought that somehow it had been dictated by some kind of emotional factors connected with a lot of other equally emotional statements by some Russian deputies and some members of the Russian leadership. **********Now, I'm not talking about Yeltsin. But there were some statements to the effect that we have to convey all union functions to the Russian Parliament or the Russian leadership, all union prerogatives to the President of Russia. I understand that this evokes a kind of a negative reaction. I understand it perfectly well. But I cannot understand something else. **********Today there's a serious danger, a much greater danger they will take hasty decisions. Today we are deciding the future of the country and to some degree the future of humanity. Therefore it's very important that we not do things hastily, superficially, carried along by this wave of emotion in talking about national independence and the rest. **********Let me just give you one example. I was very concerned by the fact that the statements of the representatives of our republics, who talked about the necessity of full state independence, never said a word about how they were liquidating the Communist structures and what they're going to do with the party property. There's a very severe danger. All this talk of independence is designed to cover the desire to retain these party structures but in a new form, retain these party bureaucrats but simply call them national bureaucrats or national leaders. **********Until we have liberated our country from all the remnants of the Communist structures, we have to be quite straightforward to everybody. First of all, let us liquidate those elements or that system that has been suffocating us all these years. **********Let us first of all create the necessary legal basis, and then everybody has the right or every people, every state formation has the right to independence, to solving its own national problems. But in the beginning, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of every citizen so that we not condemn our citizens in various of these republics to a new totalitarian existence. And I think this is one of the most important problems before us. Mistake: Party Reforms **********Furthermore, I would like us to take a look at our ability to criticize ourselves. I think that the statement of our President was the most self-critical, although it could have even been more self-critical. We're talking about the mistakes of the union leadership and personally about Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. **********His main mistake was that all the economic and political changes in the country were presented as the desire to reform a Communist society. So all reforms were acceptable or not acceptable to the degree they were acceptable to the Communist Party. **********And so these six years of attempts to reform the unreformable was our main mistake, and this is something we should have recognized a long time ago. We should have recognized that this system could not be reformed, was not capable of being reformed, and it should have been dissolved from the beginning. This is something we just waited to do today. It took a coup d'etat to do it. And let us look at ourselves critically, more critically than we have done in the past and all of this. **********Let us recall how we sat by and witnessed the continuing manipulations in this very hall, in particular, the last six months, when we agreed that we wouldn't come, didn't have to come here every single day. I was never here one time to deal with an item on the agenda decided upon ahead of time, that that particular item was in fact examined on that day. **********Every day Anatoly Lukyanov, was manipulating the agenda, manipulating the apparat, manipulating our votes in order to get the decisions he wanted. We should ask ourselves why we went along with this. Why did we deputies and members of the Supreme Soviet responsible for the work of this body, did we accept the dicta of this one individual who always got what he wanted? **********When he saw that the hall was against him, he postponed the decision and two or three days later, when there was a different atmosphere in the hall, when some of the deputies were not here, then he submitted an item for a vote. That is something which we should take note of. **********O.K., the judiciary will deal with Lukyanov and we'll find out what he really did and what role he played in this plot. But let us take a look at the position of our own legislative bodies. It's said that Lukyanov did not  [ unintelligible ] , but how about the committees, how about the factions? We have dozens of groups of deputies. Why did not one of those factions convoke on Aug. 19 and announce its own attitude? You are people's deputies after all. The decisions depend on you. This is called the Supreme Soviet. Nobody is higher than us. **********Why did not one single committee come and save the honor of the Supreme Soviet and condemn the activities of the emergency committee? Why did we permit ourselves to be led by the nose and did not speak with our own voice? We showed the decisions of the President to the generals. Where were our committees, where was our committee on security, which today, on the 24th, is publishing its conclusions? Where were the other committees? Return of Conspiracy **********Any committee could have met. How many people there were here, and could have taken its own decisions. Why did not any of them do this? Everyone of us here should look at his own conscience and ask why this was not done -- but they didn't do it. So let us think of the kind of system we want to have in the future so that this does not happen again. **********I am very concerned that today's discussions will be a very favorable soil for conspirators to come back in the future. Imagine if we had spoken this way on the eve of the coup. Think what kind of encouragement this would have given to the emergency committee. This is something, comrades, that you have all got without trying to conceal or gloss over your own role -- have got to take into consideration. **********But we cannot dissolve any governing bodies -- this is something we absolutely cannot do. We cannot remove the President, we cannot dissolve the Supreme Soviet. Who is going to run the country if we do that? **********We do not have a government. Therefore we need right now to insure that there is some authority, there is somebody to hand the authority over to. This session has got to solve a number of major issues. **********And on the last day of our previous session, when we decide some issues, I think that is the time to talk about dissolving ourselves in order to make way for a new election. We can have different types of elections. It will be a function of the new union of sovereign republics. **********But what shall we do today or tomorrow? We have time. This is in our control. We've got to abolish our own law giving the President supplementary laws, this very emergency rule of which was at the basis for many of the decrees of the emergency committee, but which the President did not use. **********What is the danger of such legislation, that if one person does not make use of this sort of law, then somebody else will? In this case Gorbachev never used any of those supplementary powers that were given to him, but the conspirators did make use of them in order to carry out a coup d'etat. **********Therefore I hereby propose at this session that that particular law be abolished. **********There is appeal from some delegates from the northwest and from the three Baltic republics, and I think it will be given to you -- and here we give our positions on a number of questions, in particular the question of the necessity of abolishing a number of laws relating to decrees of the Supreme Soviet with respect to the information media in particular. **********We at the Supreme Soviet have to examine the legality of some other decisions taken, such as the one to close up some of the newspapers and informational media. And bear in mind that we have a law on how these measures can be carried out, and the Supreme Soviet should examine that decree as well so as not to, on a wave of euphoria, make the kind of mistakes that will be a source of shame to us in the future. We've got to manifest self-restraint and create so that in the future we will not say that we missed the opportunity to bring our country out on the path of freedom and democracy. NURSULTAN A. NAZARBAYEV  President of Kazakhstan **********Esteemed peoples' deputies: Last week was not just a period of time. It was an epoch that divided us from all our past. It was a time of victory for the reactionary forces. But the people of Moscow stood face to face with tanks that were trying to restore authoritarianism. . . . **********Concern for the future of our country demands that we cope with the problems facing us. As we can see, these problems are far from being resolved. **********All of us today have a different awareness, and this obliges us to take a new view of the country's future and of the union treaty. **********It is clear to me that a renewed union cannot be a federation. We have spent too long chasing after the past. The Ukraine's declaration of independence, and a similar decision by Byelorussia, witness a new historical reality that we cannot escape or ignore. **********The situation has changed radically. You know that I was in favor of signing the union treaty, but recent events have shown how explosive the old plan was. We heard Andrei Sakharov call for the union's transformation into a community, a federation, a commonwealth, but his call fell on deaf ears. **********In a future union what we have in mind is more economic relations with the center. . . . Each republic should have its own army. This decision has already been made in many republics. Each republican army will send detachments under orders of the Defense Ministry, and if there is a common threat the Defense Ministry will mobilize all of the forces. . . . **********This is true also for inter-republican ties. The problem of disarmament should also be dealt with in a coordinated way. Each republic should set up its own Foreign Ministry for conducting external, economic activities and for concluding treaties with other countries. Each republic should have its own consulates to protect or defend its citizens wherever they may be located in the world. **********We are used to the term U.S.S.R. We propose leaving it, and expanding it into the Free Union of Sovereign republics. By this I mean all republics including the autonomous republics that have declared or intend to declare their independence.  Human and Language Rights **********We should give representatives of every nationality the right to speak in their own language at republic and union meetings, and each republic should have the right to hear their deputy in their mother tongue. Thus, we are in favor of a confederative treaty, and we are convinced that only in that way will we achieve equal rights among republics. Only in this way will we achieve a genuine federation. **********I would also like to mention that the existing union treaty is practically a confederative one. Let us recognize this and dot our 'i's. Only if we conclude an economic agreement also can we have a stable situation in which every republic will have full respect for its rights. **********We must grant human rights to every individual regardless of culture, race, religion or background. For this, Kazakhstan is ready to invite an international commission to work and be in a multinational republic. We urge that all violations of human rights cease immediately. We are also ready to invite a commission of experts to inspect hospitals in our republic. We also propose that all we also feel this to be a guarantee of the rule of law in our republic. I urge that all question of granting sovereignty to the Baltics, Georgia, and Moldavia to be given at once. **********It's true that this may cost some money but human lives are more valuable. **********In the new union there should be no union cabinet of ministers or union parliament, except groups or delegations from different republics. **********This is a moment of truth. I cannot see any other basis on which Kazakhstan will be willing to join the union. This is our strategy, and in the near future we have to form not a cabinet of ministers but a transitional goverment in which all of the republics will participate as part of an economic commonwealth. This interim economic council can include all of those including those who have decided to leave the union but are determined to continue their economic cooperation later. **********I don't want anybody to have the illusion that Kazakhstan will be anybody's younger brother. We will join a union only with equal rights and opportunities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/03/business/new-measure-for-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Measure For Economy", "print_headline": "New Measure For Economy", "body_text": " **********The Government this week will no longer emphasize figures for the gross national product, favoring instead numbers on gross domestic product. **********What's the difference? **********The gross national product measures all the goods and services produced by workers and capital supplied by United States residents or corporations, regardless of location.

Disease,' Then Listen", "print_headline": "Managing; Call It 'C.E.O. Disease,' Then Listen", "body_text": " **********FIVE years ago, when W. Thomas Stephens became the Manville Corporation's chief executive, he toured several company plants. He expected to see somber workers. Manville, after all, was in bankruptcy -- asbestos, its original raison d'etre, had been found to cause a deadly form of lung cancer and the company was fighting a withering array of lawsuits; and, its attempts to remake itself into a fiberglass and paper packaging concern were causing chaos in the evolving corporate culture. **********Still, he did not expect the outright hostility he got. \"Wherever I went, I'd get this, 'Why should I trust you?' attitude,\" Mr. Stephens recalls. \"I realized then that management's reaction to the horrors of the last decade had been to shut the windows, close the doors, hide behind a cloak of secrecy, not only externally but internally as well.\" **********In fact, Mr. Stephens was suffering from what he calls \"C.E.O. disease,\" a communications disorder in which the chief executive has a distorted view of what the troops think because he or she gets all information from top management. His cure of choice: A President's Council, comprised of 15 or so Manville employees, representing different levels and business units. The council members, who serve indefinite terms, are charged with alerting him to communications glitches at any level of the hierarchy. **********\"Our job is to make sure that no information gets filtered out, on the way up or on the way down,\" said Georgianna Peterson, an employee relations manager on the council. **********Mr. Stephens offers a more colorful description: \"Their job is to get me hot and bothered enough about communications problems so that I'm motivated to fix them.\" **********Apparently they do that job well. Since the council's inception three years ago, Manville has developed a set of governing principles, as well as a mechanism to encourage supervisors to hash out those principles with their staffs. Mr. Stephens has ended his habit of formal plant tours that are orchestrated by plant managers in favor of informal drop-ins during which he visits with workers. **********He now periodically sends letters describing the company's strategic goals to employees at their homes, where middle managers cannot inadvertently forget to distribute them and where families can review them. The letters, which include stamped envelopes addressed to Mr. Stephens, invite employees' suggestions or criticisms on any aspect of Manville's operations. More than 500 letters have come in, all of which Mr. Stephens says he answered personally. **********Council members use voice mail, corridor conversation or any other data gathering method they like to query their colleagues on what issues they want taken up with Mr. Stephens. They then convene to set priorities on issues. Finally, they confront Mr. Stephens with those issues. **********The issues can be as concrete as the cost factors involved in Manville's new flexible benefits plan, or as abstract as expressions of vague uneasiness about the way assets are allocated among divisions. **********\"Tom never sidesteps questions or sugarcoats answers, and we make sure we convey everything he says when we go back home,\" said Arthur E. Flach, a technical support specialist on the council. **********Actually, the ground rules for reporting back are that only Mr. Stephens is quoted by name; anything that any council member says is repeated anonymously. **********One reason is that \"We don't want a cult of personalities,\" said Sharon Stensaas, until recently a manager of employee communications, who helped set up the council. Another is so that lower-level council members need not worry about repercussions from their comments when they return home. \"No one's afraid to speak out,\" said Janis Dolan, a maintenance worker on the council. **********Mr. Stephens continues to look for new ways to convey information directly. In the works: A system for sending monthly voice mail messages to employees, and for them to respond. He is also looking into whether to teleconference council meetings, so that they wreak less havoc with everyone's schedules. **********He stresses that none of these methods will replace face-to-face rap sessions, though. He tells a recent story to illustrate why: **********Last month, Mr. Stephens says, he wandered from floor to floor at the Denver headquarters, buttonholing people and asking them what was on their minds. **********\"I figured they were all worried that we had lost money in the last quarter,\" Mr. Stephens said. \"Turns out, they had full confidence in the company. They were a lot more worried about our plan to move offices. It just shows that you can't guess what's bothering folks; you have to ask.\" GETTING THE BOARD INVOLVED **********Manville's board, intrigued with the President's Council concept, has dined with the group twice. Directors say it was eye-opening for both sides. **********\"Council members seemed surprised that we saw them as people, not numbers,\" said Robert E. Fowler, a Manville director who heads the Silvestri Corporation, a Chicago distributor of decorative accessories. **********Board members, meanwhile, were surprised at the nonadversarial stance taken by the council's union workers. Archie R. Dykes, chief executive of the Nashville-based Education Corporation of America and a Manville director, said he felt better about giving a green light to a multimillion-dollar expansion at Manville's West Monroe, La., plant after talking to an hourly worker on the council. **********\"He clearly understood that he had as much at stake in Manville's success as did shareholders,\" Mr. Dykes said. **********The directors are expanding their dialogue with workers beyond the council.

They enjoyed the best of food and drink. **********They are members of the 26 families of the Communist elite that for more than four decades ruled Albania, the poorest country of Europe. **********Now an item-by-item accounting of the indulgences of the former Communist leaders has been made public by a special investigating commission. **********While considerable information has emerged over the last 20 months about the lavish living of senior party officials in Romania, Bulgaria and the former East Germany, the Albanian report appears to be the most detailed and comprehensive portrayal of the practices of a Communist elite. **********Its completeness derives from the fact that the Albanian Communist leaders concentrated the bulk of their avarice in a single operation called the Directorate of Receptions, which recorded every transaction in detail. **********The directorate was created in 1956 by Enver Hoxha, the Stalinist dictator who ruled for 41 years until his death in 1985. Its authorization was secretly decreed by the party Politburo. **********Until early this year, when the Communist Party lost its monopoly on power, the directorate maintained a staff of 646 employees. **********The 26 families, including those of Mr. Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, were virtually all headed by members of the Politburo that ran the ruling Communist Party, including some who had retired. **********As described by Genc Ruli, the Finance Minister of the coalition Government elected in June, the inquiry into the last three years of the directorate's work led to the conclusion \"that the former party leadership created for itself every opportunity to acquire privileges and enrich itself while the people were deceived by bogus and cynical propaganda about a struggle against privileges, luxury and inequality.\" **********For public purposes, Mr. Ruli noted, the Communist leaders said their salaries were the equivalent of $1,600 a year -- little more than twice the average factory wages in Albania. **********In fact, the inquiry showed that in addition to many other benefits, the leaders and their relatives were given subsidies that kept their rent, fuel and electricity bills to a total of $25 a month per family. **********Last year, when food was rationed for almost all of the 3.5 million Albanians, the priviliged party families received huge quantities of food free. The investigators estimated that the meat -- 136 pounds a day for the 26 families -- would have filled the quotas of 450 ordinary Albanian families. **********The Hoxha family alone -- including his widow and three children -- was supplied last year with 2 tons of meat, 310 pounds of butter, 62 gallons of beer and over 80 gallons of brandy and wine. **********The party families received other benefits ranging from the minor to the munificent. These included an annual vacation allowance of $19.20, entertainment subsidies of as much as $22,300 and up to $18,900 worth of private telephone calls abroad. **********The elite lived in spacious houses set in a protected compound in Tirana. When its occupants were moved out to apartments last spring, they looted furnishings and appliances valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Mr. Ruli's report to Parliament. **********Among the biggest spenders -- accounting for hundreds of thousands of dollars -- was Nexhmije Hoxha, the 70-year-old widow of the former dictator. **********In addition to free medical treatment at a special clinic, the ruling families often traveled abroad for medical attention. Former Deputy Prime Minister Manush Myftiu's daughter-in-law was sent to Vienna at a cost $3,800 for treatment of migraine headaches, as was the daughter of Besnik Bekteshi, a Politburo member, at a cost of $3,400. **********Mr. Ruli said legal proceedings had been instituted against members of the 26 families and that Albanian courts would determine their \"legal accountability\" and the \"level of compensation these persons will have to pay.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/business/stocks-rise-in-tokyo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Rise in Tokyo", "print_headline": "Stocks Rise in Tokyo", "body_text": " **********Japanese stocks regained some ground today after dropping sharply on Wednesday.

A similar consensus has emerged among private economists in the last two weeks. **********In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan made these other comments about the economy: ***********Banks continue to be reluctant to lend, and credit is still tight. ***********The commercial real estate market remains in a slump and is not likely to recover as quickly as the rest of the economy does. ***********Foreign trade barriers do not significantly depress American exports, while United States trade barriers cost American consumers tens of billions of dollars a year. Optimism About Inflation **********In response to a question from Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, Mr. Greenspan said he was \"confident that we can come out of this with a recovery without concurrently reigniting inflationary forces, which inevitably, within a reasonably short period, create the next recession.\" **********But he added that \"we don't yet see any measurable upward thrust\" in the nation's output of goods and services. And in response to further questions, Mr. Greenspan refused to say how long a recovery might last or how strong it might be. **********In testimony two weeks ago, however, Mr. Greenspan said the recovery might be stronger than expected. **********At a separate hearing by the Senate Finance Committee on the nomination of David W. Mullins Jr. to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Mullins said the economy had touched bottom in the last month or so, or was about to do so. Edward Kelley, a Federal Reserve governor, told the Senate Banking Committee last week that the economy appeared to have bottomed out. **********Congressional pressure for lower rates notwithstanding, Mr. Mullins said, \"it's not apparent that there is room\" for the central bank to ease monetary policy soon without raising fears of inflation that could drive up rates on longer-term bonds. An increase in interest rates on long-term bonds might defeat the purpose of stimulating the economy by easing monetary policy, Mr. Mullins said. **********By pumping more money into the nation's banking system, the Federal Reserve can drive down short-term rates, making it cheaper for stores to hold large inventories and for consumers to take out home equity loans. **********But such a move tends to drive up long-term rates, as lenders become concerned that inflation will seriously devalue the money they are to be repaid. Long-term rates tend to affect purchases of homes and other large investments. **********Mr. Mullins said any gain to the economy from driving down short-term rates now would probably be offset by the loss from higher long-term rates. **********Mr. Greenspan said banks continue to be cautious in their lending practices, as they try to build up capital in case many of their nonperforming loans must be written off entirely. As a result, he said, \"We are still in the grips of a credit crunch.\" **********Many of the banking industry's problem loans have financed commercial real estate. Mr. Greenspan said this sector of the economy would \"lag quite considerably\" in its recovery from the recession. **********\"It shows very few signs that I can see that it is in the process of stabilizing; there's some, but not a great deal,\" he said. \"But surely there is no evidence at this point which suggests that it is improving or about to.\" **********But an upturn in the number of Americans employed is likely a few months after a rebound in the nation's total output of goods and services, Mr. Greenspan said. **********Few questions to Mr. Greenspan from members of the House Ways and Means Committee dealt with the original subject of the hearing, the competitiveness of the United States in international markets. **********In his opening remarks, Mr. Greenspan strongly endorsed the Administration's position of eliminating trade barriers and holding down Government intervention in the market. There have been plausible estimates that \"the unilateral removal of quantitative restrictions on imports of textiles, apparel and various agricultural products would result in net gains to U.S. consumers amounting to tens of billions of dollars,\" he said. **********\"Moreover,\" he added, \"the complete removal of existing foreign restrictions on U.S. exports probably would reduce our trade deficit by only modest amounts.\" **********Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Government should not provide subsidies to specific industries even if they appear especially likely to succeed. If the industries have genuinely good prospects, then the private sector will finance them, he said. **********But the chairman of the Federal Reserve has no legal authority over these issues, and many in Congress already have firm views about them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/business/chase-has-profit-as-turnaround-continues.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1991-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 610, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chase Has Profit as Turnaround Continues", "print_headline": "Chase Has Profit as Turnaround Continues", "body_text": " **********Chase Manhattan, although still working its way out of staggering loan losses, reported a $136 million net profit yesterday for the third quarter.

He said in early October that third-quarter income would be about 80 cents a share. **********Chase's shares rose 50 cents yesterday, closing at $19 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Net interest revenue -- mostly the spread between what Chase earns from interest on the loans it makes and what it pays to borrow the money that is lent out -- rose to $863 million from $795 million in last year's third quarter. Interest rates paid by Chase's borrowers fell more slowly than the rates the bank paid on deposits and to borrow funds in the market place. **********Chase also reported a $45 million contribution to income, representing interest payments from Brazil, which had not made such payments on its Chase loans in last year's third quarter. **********\"If you look at the profitability ratio, Chase now has a return on average shareholder equity of 10.5 percent, which I would consider about average for Chase going back over time,\" Mr. Hanley said. In last year's third quarter, the return on shareholder equity was a negative 58.9 percent. **********Chase also reported an increase in the bank's capital, which serves as a cushion against loan losses. The most important capital measure, tier-one equity capital as a percent of risk-based assets, rose to 5.2 percent, well above the 4 percent minimum that will be required by the end of next year under newly adopted international banking standards. In addition, Chase's nonperforming loans, on which payments are not being made, fell to a total of $4.4 billion from $4.6 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in last year's third quarter.  Loan Losses Decline **********Net loan losses fell in the third quarter, to $656 million from $682 million in the second quarter. But the charge-offs were far above the $380 million lost in last year's third quarter. The figures included $236 million in domestic loan charge-offs in the third quarter, down $22 million from the second quarter but $21 million above the comparable period last year. **********Consumer loans accounted for the biggest loss, $123 million, the same as in the second quarter. Commercial real estate losses were $86 million, compared with $117 million in the second quarter and $61 million in last year's third quarter. **********Chase put aside $265 million in the third quarter for possible loan losses in the future, the same amount as in the second quarter and down sharply from the $650 million in last year's third quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-text-of-the-radio-address-by-the-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 865, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Text of the Radio Address by the President", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Text of the Radio Address by the President", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of the radio address by President Bush today, as issued by the White House: **********As the new year begins, new challenges unfold -- challenges to America and the future of our world. Simply put: 1990 saw Iraq invade and occupy Kuwait. 1991 will see Iraq withdraw, preferably by choice; by force, if need be. It is my most sincere hope 1991 is a year of peace. I've seen the hideous face of war and counted the costs of conflict in friends lost. I remember this all too well, and have no greater concern than the well-being of our men and women stationed in the Persian Gulf. True, their morale is sky-high. True, if they are called upon to fight the aggressors, they will do their job courageously, professionally and, in the end, decisively. There will be no more Vietnams. **********But we should go the extra mile before asking our servicemen and women to stand in harm's way. We should, and we have. The United Nations, with the full support of the United States, has already tried to peacefully pressure Iraq out of Kuwait, implementing economic sanctions, and securing the condemnation of the world in the form of no less than 12 resolutions of the U.N. Security Council. **********This week, we've taken one more step. I have offered to have Secretary of State James Baker meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Switzerland. yesterday, we received word that Iraq has accepted our offer to meet in Geneva.  Baker's Message **********This will not be secret diplomacy at work. Secretary Baker will restate, in person, a message for Saddam Hussein: Withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally and immediately, or face the terrible consequences. **********Eleven days from today, Saddam Hussein will either have met the United Nations deadline for a full and unconditional withdrawal, or he will have once again defied the civilized world. This is a deadline for Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations resolution, not a deadline for our own Armed Forces. Still, time is running out. It's running out because each day that passes brings real costs. **********Saddam already poses a strategic threat to the capital cities of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and Syria, as well as our own men and women in the gulf region. In fact, Saddam has used chemical weapons of mass destruction against innocent villagers, his own people. Each day that passes brings Saddam Hussein further on the path to developing biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. If Saddam corners the world energy market, he can then finance further aggression, terror and blackmail. Each day that passes increases Saddam's worldwide threat to democracy.  Economic Effects **********The struggling newborn democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America already face a staggering challenge in making the transition to a free market. But the added weight of higher oil prices is a crushing burden they cannot afford. And our own economy is suffering, suffering the effects of higher oil prices and lower growth stemming from Saddam's aggression. **********Each day that passes, Saddam's forces also fortify and dig in deeper into Kuwait. We risk paying a higher price in the most precious currency of all -- human life -- if we give Saddam more time to prepare for war. And each day that passes is another day of fear, suffering and terror for the people of Kuwait, many who risked their lives to shelter and hide Americans from Iraqi soldiers. As the Emir of Kuwait said to our Vice President just last week, those who advocate waiting longer for sanctions to work do not have to live under such brutal occupation. **********As I have discussed with members of Congress, just two days ago and in our many other consultations, economic sanctions are taking a toll, but they are still not forcing Saddam out of Kuwait. Nor do we know when or even if they will be successful. As a result, America and her partners in this unprecedented coalition are sharing the burden of this important mission; and we are ready to use force to defend a new order emerging among the nations of the world, a world of sovereign nations living in peace.  Forces at the Front **********We have seen too often in this century how quickly any threat to one becomes a threat to all. At this critical moment in history, at a time the cold war is fading into the past, we cannot fail. At stake is not simply some distant country called Kuwait. At stake is the kind of world we will inhabit. **********Last Thanksgiving, I broke bread with some of our men and women on the front lines. They understand why we are in Saudi Arabia, and what we may have to do. I witnessed courage unfazed by the closeness of danger and determination undiminished by the harsh desert sun. These men and women are America's finest. We owe each of them our gratitude and full support. That is why we must all stand together, not as Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, but as Americans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/23/business/company-news-delay-in-shipping-of-compaq-laptop.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Delay in Shipping Of Compaq Laptop", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Delay in Shipping Of Compaq Laptop", "body_text": " **********The Compaq Computer Corporation told some retailers its newest laptop computer might not be available until March.

The company's annual operating profits totaled $:200.2 million, or roughly $347 million. **********In that fiscal year, however, Maxwell Communication's interest payments on its debt totaled $:196 million, or roughly $340 million, almost completely offsetting these profits. **********\"The business have performed more strongly than Maxwell really had any right to expect,\" said William Reilly, chairman of the magazine publisher K-III Holdings Inc. and former president of Maxwell Communication. \"In fact, the financial results have been excellent. **********\"But he overpaid in a major way at a time when prices for media properties were sky high, and the debt is taking a toll,\" Mr. Reilly added, referring to Robert Maxwell, the company's founder, who died Tuesday. **********The obligations on Maxwell Communication's debt, now estimated at $2.5 billion, are pressuring the company to sell American properties whose strong performance might otherwise incline it to keep them. A loan repayment of $750 million is due next October. **********Since September, the company has sold four American businesses -- Maxwell Macmillan Professional and Business Reference Publishing, the medical book division, the Macmillan directory division (which publishes \"Who's Who\") and, most recently, its stake in Berlitz International Inc. -- for a total of $479 million. **********These were all solid businesses for Maxwell Communication. Berlitz, for example, increased its sales by 35.5 percent in the last fiscal year to $:152.9 million, or roughly $265 million. An executive formerly involved in the business said Berlitz's profit margin was probably at least 17 percent.  'We Are Not Rushing Around' **********\"The disposal program is directed toward the repayment of debt, and that program continues,\" said David Shaffer, the company's new chief operating officer. \"But we are not rushing around engaging in any new conversations. We are continuing the discussions with various interested parties that we have been having for the past four to six months.\" **********He declined to say what other pieces of the corporation's American operations might be for sale. But some analysts suggested one possibility was the Standard Rate and Data Service, which provides information on media rates to advertisers and is believed to have a profit margin in excess of 20 percent. **********\"The Maxwell businesses here are all very good businesses and they are doing well,\" said Robert S. Pirie, the president and chief executive of Rothschild Inc. and one of the Maxwell family's investment bankers. **********The corporation's Macmillan Publishing Company has done particularly well in a generally difficult climate. Its adult-trade, or general-interest, publishing unit has earned a reputation for tight management at a time when many other publishers have consistently overpaid for books. Results in Other Sectors **********Meanwhile, the less volatile college, reference and juvenile sectors have also produced excellent results, said a former officer of Macmillan, who added that profit margins at Macmillan Publishing exceeded 20 percent on sales of about $350 million. **********Moreover, the 50-50 joint venture with McGraw-Hill Inc. in school publishing, set up in 1989, has also been highly successful. Last year, for example, it reached a record 36 percent share of the school market in Texas. **********The least successful part of Maxwell Communication's 1988 buying spree -- during which Macmillan was acquired for $2.6 billion, or about 20 times its earnings -- has been Official Airline Guides, a largely stagnant business bought for $750 million. **********If Maxwell Communication chooses to sell Official Airline Guides, analysts believe it will have to settle for a much lower price than it paid. 'So Many Sudden Changes' **********The problems for Maxwell Communication have been compounded by the fact that Robert Maxwell's death followed the departure of Harry A. McQuillen, the president of Macmillan Publishing. His successor has not yet been named. **********\"It obviously unnerves some people to have so many sudden changes at the top,\" said Barry Lippman, who heads the adult-trade division at Macmillan. But he added that Mr. Shaffer had quickly put people in the publishing company at ease. **********This week, for example, Mr. Lippman was making a large bid for a book and sought Mr. Shaffer's approval while he was in London to talk with the Maxwell family. A faxed response came back immediately. \"He must carry his fax machine on his hip,\" Mr. Lippman said. **********In general, two former officials of Maxwell Communication said, Robert Maxwell tended to be less involved with the American book and information-service businesses than he was with his newspapers. The adjustment to his death, they sugested, should therefore be less traumatic. Abandoning a Spinoff Plan **********Still, financial pressures remain severe. Some analysts suggested this was the reason the company said this week that it was moving away from an earlier plan to spin off some American businesses into a separate public company. **********Mr. Shaffer declined to explain the switch. He would say only that one aim of the \"de-merger plan\" had been to bring all the businesses of Maxwell Communication under American management, and that this had already been achieved by his appointment as the company's chief operating officer.

Blithe college students shovel corn chips straight from the bag into their mouths, but paunchy young professionals count their Ritz crackers as they reach for the bean dip. **********The snack-food industry, which built its fortune on the voracious, must now come up with products that appeal to a variety of appetites, as well as answer consumers' growing worries about health and nutrition. To increase sales, it must win the nibblers and keep the gobblers. **********So, for the first time in more than 20 years, the industry is developing truly new products. It is making healthier, or at least healthier seeming, snacks made from grains and prepared with little or no oil with saturated fats. Sales of Frito-Lay's Sunchips and Mesa Food's Chi-Chi's white corn tortilla chips are thriving. Old standbys, like pretzels and popcorn, both of which can be made without oil, are enjoying a revival. **********The modern American snack-food business has become a nearly $12 billion industry, a point reached in 1989, dominated by a small shelf full of companies led by Pepsico Inc.'s Frito-Lay division, and other giants like Borden and Anheuser-Busch Inc. **********The typical snack-food consumer is someone from 15 to 20 years old and inured to the criticism that snack food is empty calories, high in sodium and saturated fats -- which have been linked to heart disease. **********As the baby boom generation ages, more of the population is hitting the far side of 45 years old. Having experienced intimations of mortality, this growing group is increasingly concerned about its health. About 80 percent of all snack foods are eaten by just 20 percent of snack-food consumers, typically those under 20 years old. **********\"When people ask me what I do,\" said George J. Waydo, president of the snack- foods division of Borden Inc., \"I tell them I'm in one of mankind's oldest and most important pursuits -- oral gratification.\" **********Who Sells the Most? Frito-Lay Is Leading a $12 Billion Market **********In 1989, the latest year for which data are available, Americans spent nearly $130 per household per year on snack foods, according to the Snack Food Association, a trade group. **********That amount is up nearly 10 percent from the year before and is growing substantially faster than other food categories, like soup or cereal. Since a person can only eat so much, increased snacking displaces other foods, but which ones is unclear. It is likely that salty snacks are taking a little bit away from cookies, crackers, ice cream and candy bars. **********Salty snacks is a catch-all category, as shown by what the average household eats: about 49 pounds per year of potato chips, tortilla chips, corn chips, pretzels, popcorn; \"extruded\" snacks like cheese puffs, which are forced and shaped through a dye; assorted nuts and onion rings, as well as foods that may call for an acquired taste, like pork rinds, the fried coating found on bacon. And what's the biggest item? Sixteen pounds of potato chips. **********The industry is not at all fragmented: Frito-Lay is the General Motors, Ford and Toyota of the snack-food business. Depending on which foods are included, Frito-Lay has nearly 50 percent of the market. **********Frito-Lay is strong in most of the major categories of the snack-food business, except nuts, with its dominant brands like Lay's potato chips, Doritos tortilla chips, Frito corn chips and Cheetos cheese-flavored snacks. **********Analysts say it is among the best-performing of the big food companies. In 1990, Frito-Lay had $5 billion in snack-food sales (some of it from foreign sales) and nearly $1 billion in profit in 1990. It is the smallest of Pepsico's three divisions in sales, but largest in profits. **********William Leach, a food industry analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities, said Frito-Lay's 19 percent profit margin approaches that of Kellogg's. \"And Kellogg buys corn for 4 cents a pound and sells it for $2 a box,\" said Mr. Leach. **********With this background in mind, it was small wonder that last month when Pepsico announced its first-quarter results, its stock price fell temporarily, by $1.75. While first-quarter worldwide sales rose 16 percent to $1.2 billion, operating profit dropped 4 percent to $175 million, mostly because of weak margins in the domestic market, the result of furious price cutting in the industry. **********The retail price of snacks, typically $1.49 a bag, is discounted on any given day from a third to a half -- roughly from 79 cents to 99 cents. **********Borden, with a snack-food portfolio similar to Frito-Lay's, is up and coming, though still a distant No. 2. Built aggressively during the 1980's by the acquisition of small regional companies, Borden has, for example, 12 brands of potato chips. **********Anheuser-Busch, the beer company, has its Eagle snacks subsidiary; RJR Nabisco Inc., the tobacco and food company, has its Planters nuts unit. They are also major presences in the market, but their snack-food divisions are minor parts of their total revenues. **********How Laggers Catch Up Efficient Production and Distribution **********The food industry's consolidation continues as big companies swallow up smaller ones. In the all-important supermarket portion of the industry, five companies made up 59 percent of sales last year, up from 58 percent the year before. **********Smaller companies, including Borden, find it difficult to compete with Frito-Lay because a high sales volume allows a company to spend more money on advertising, enhance its manufacturing efficiency and cut prices. **********\"It's rough making money in this business,\" said Mr. Waydo, Borden's snack-foods executive. \"Frito-Lay has the critical mass, so it would be murder trying to duplicate their distribution.\" Borden's solution: buy small regional companies, consolidate their distribution and pour national brands like Krunchers potato chips and new products like Wise Choice popcorn into the expanded distribution network. **********Borden is also using new machinery to eliminate expensive human labor. For example, optical scanners spot defective potato chips. As a result, Borden cut its manufacturing cost from up to 60 cents on the sales dollar during 1983 to 1985, to about 40 cents today. **********More profit can come from squeezing more savings from efficient distribution. Like Frito-Lay, Borden's distribution is direct to the store. That means a truck delivers to supermarkets daily -- about 4,000 trucks making half a million visits a week. **********\"Having little trucks go door to door is the most inefficient thing you can do, unless you've got the volume,\" said Mr. Waydo. **********To pull more selling time out of its sales staff, Borden reorganized its distribution system. It went from using large warehouses to a system with 10 times as many small warehouses called \"bin locations.\" These bin locations have smaller inventories of snack foods. Instead of having salespeople drive long distances to large warehouses, they now go to smaller centers. **********What's Healthy?  A Durum Wheat Snack: Suprimos **********But squeezing savings out of manufacturing and distribution goes only so far, as even efficient Frito-Lay knows. The market leader has long worried that snack-food consumption drops off sharply after consumers reach their 20's. **********To remedy this, in 1989, Frito-Lay bought Smartfoods, a small Boston entrepreneurial company that makes popcorn, to appeal to a wider and older audience. Young women, in particular, regard popcorn as lower in calories than other snack foods, even though it's coated, as Smartfoods' is, with Cheddar cheese, adding calories. **********\"We needed to build a category in which people could snack throughout their 20's, and we felt that a product made from multigrains would be appealing,\" said David J. Guston, senior vice president marketing for Frito-Lay. **********That was the strategy behind Sunchips, introduced in a test market in February 1991. Ten years in development, Sunchips is made from wheat, corn, rice and oats and fried in canola oil, which is low in saturated fats. Achieving the right taste was the main hurdle: 10,000 consumer taste tests went into the development. **********What is Frito-Lay testing? Suprimos, durum wheat (as in pasta) snacks, coated in a cheese flavoring. \"People do not need snack foods,\" Mr. Guston said. \"Our job as marketers is to entertain and bring happiness to people.\" CHI-CHI'S CHIPS ARE EXTRA HOT **********The hottest product in snack foods illustrates how a slightly different product can appeal to a vastly wider audience. **********Sales of Chi-Chi's tortilla chips in grocery stores are growing at an annual rate of 50 percent, competitors say, and are now approaching 7 percent of a $2 billion tortilla-chip market. That is an impressive performance for chips that are available only in about a fifth of the country. **********Chi-Chi's chips are simply the ones that are handed out by the bowl at Chi-Chi's restaurants, a chain of 225 Anglo-Mexican restaurants in sections of the country where Mexican food is rare, like the Middle West. **********As with many snack foods, the great dividing line is between products in a bag, which appeal mainly to voracious young people under 20, and those in a box, which appeal mainly to nibblers over 40. **********Tortilla chips usually appeal to the very hungry, but Chi-Chi's chips, which are sold in a bag, are made from white corn, instead of yellow corn. **********\"People think they are tasting a lighter product, less like corn,\" said Glenn D. Drasher, senior vice president of marketing at Chi-Chi's Inc., Louisville, Ky., a unit of Foodmaker Inc. in San Diego, which operates fast-food restaurants. **********Daniel R. Miller, executive vice president of Mesa Food Products Inc., which produces the chips under license from Chi-Chi's, said, white corn has \"a more delicate, sweeter taste and it has a different mouth-feel altogether.\" **********Because Chi-Chi's product was first introduced in the company's restaurants, the chips are also popular for making nachos. \"The beauty of this chip is that it gets the college crowd and the aging yuppies,\" said Mr. Miller."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/19/business/the-media-business-microsoft-stake-in-publisher.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Stake In Publisher", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Microsoft Stake In Publisher", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had purchased a 26 percent stake in Dorling Kindersley Ltd., a London-based book publisher. **********Dorling Kindersley specializes in highly illustrated, practical reference books for adults and children, including \"The Way Things Work,\" by David Macaulay. **********Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Widens Inquiry In Treasuries Scandal", "body_text": " **********The Treasuries market scandal that has rocked Salomon Brothers Inc. widened yesterday as the Securities and Exchange Commission began requesting documents from dozens of other firms, people who have been briefed on the growing inquiry said. The commission is seeking evidence of possible widespread collusion, fraud and other illegal practices in the $2.2 trillion Treasuries market. **********The far-reaching requests began to go out over the weekend, providing the first indication that Government investigators suspect that illegal bidding practices of the sort disclosed at Salomon Brothers may have been more widespread than previously thought. All primary dealers, which are the institutions authorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve, are being asked to provide documents in the inquiry, said the people who were briefed on the investigation. They spoke yesterday on condition that they not be identified. **********The requests were issued after a formal order of investigation was approved by the S.E.C.'s commissioners. People involved in the case said that the Government's official name of the investigation did not even mention Salomon Brothers; it is called \"In the Matter of Certain Treasury Notes.\" **********Naming the securities and not Salomon would seem to indicate that the commission believes the illegal activities might not be limited to those disclosed by the firm earlier this month. **********The S.E.C. has not yet subpoenaed other firms. Rather, it is asking for voluntary cooperation. \"They expect voluntary compliance,\" one person involved in the case said. \"If they don't get it, they will send subpoenas right away.\" **********The broadening of the investigation came as Salomon Brothers continued to move to restore order after the upheaval created by its admissions of illegal bidding in the Treasury market. Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor who was named chairman and chief executive of the firm on Sunday, flew to Washington yesterday to meet with a series of regulators who are currently investigating the firm. **********Mr. Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., put $700 million into Salomon in 1987 as the firm was fighting off a hostile takeover, replaced John H. Gutfreund, whose resignation as chairman and chief executive was accepted at a board meeting on Sunday. **********Salomon is currently under investigation by the S.E.C., the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department for its illegal bidding during several Treasury auctions. **********Salomon has admitted illegally purchasing more Treasury securities than the 35 percent maximum allowed any one firm, as well as other violations. Wall Street executives said such actions could create the perception that a leading force in the Treasuries market was dishonest and could damage market credibility worldwide. Dismissed Executives Replaced **********The firm also moved rapidly yesterday to replace two senior Salomon executives who were dismissed on Sunday for their role in the unfolding scandal. **********Salomon told its employees that Eric R. Rosenfeld, a 38-year-old managing director and co-head of fixed-income arbitrage, would be interim head of the Government trading desk. Hans Ulrich Hufschmid, 35, a vice president and manager of the foreign exchange desk in London, was named head of foreign exchange in New York. **********The two men replace Paul Mozer and Thomas Murphy, the two former top traders on the government desk who were dismissed for their roles in submitting illegal bids during several Treasury auctions since last December. **********As Mr. Buffett worked in Washington yesterday to contain the damage at Salomon, Deryck C. Maughan, the former co-head of investment banking, who was named chief operating officer on Sunday, took the firm's reins, seeking to calm executives at the New York office. **********In a series of morning meetings, Mr. Maughan repeatedly told the firm's executives and employees that he believed that Salomon should now turn back to its business. **********The statements were given at 8 A.M. at a meeting of the sales and trading departments and were repeated at a meeting of the investment banking division at about 8:35 A.M. **********\"He said that we have hit bottom and we are going to go up from here,\" one executive who heard Mr. Maughan's statements said. \"He said that there were going to be some of them who worried about these extraordinary events, and that the rest of us should get back to business.\" **********Mr. Maughan's statements were greeted with applause by Salomon employees, people who attended the meetings said.  Effect of Soviet Coup **********Salomon was also helped yesterday by outside factors. With traders re-energized by the tumult created in the financial world by the coup that deposed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, morale at the firm picked up. **********\"I don't mean this the wrong way, but the coup couldn't have happened at a better time,\" one executive with the firm said. \"In this, the marketplace needs Salomon Brothers, and people here can't help but focus on the marketplace.\" **********But many changes at the firm were evident. During yesterday's Treasury auction, Salomon participated, but employees were under the watchful eyes of lawyers and compliance officers to insure that all bids were properly done. As mandated by the Government on Sunday, the firm was prevented from placing bids for clients at the auctions. **********The government trading desk was also operating under a series of new rules that the lawyers and officers made sure were met. **********The changes at Salomon have not yet solved the firm's problems with its customers. Indeed, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest state pension fund, met yesterday to decide what actions it should take because of the scandal. **********\"The question of whether or not to impose any sanctions on Salomon is currently under discussion,\" said Gray Davis, the California State Comptroller. \"Clearly we have a fiduciary obligation to our benficiaries in this.\" **********The efforts to control the damage at Salomon Brothers came as primary dealers throughout Wall Street began to receive notification that the S.E.C. wanted voluminous documentation from them as part of its investigation of the scandal. **********A six-page letter dated Aug. 16 from William McLucas, the head of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, began to be sent over the weekend to the 40 primary dealers, which are the largest buyers at government auctions. **********Mr. McLucas declined yesterday to comment on the S.E.C. investigation.  The S.E.C. Request **********In the letter, he said that the \"staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting that primary dealers provide\" documents that might detail a number of illegal schemes being examined by the commission. The requests apply to documents held by both the firms and their employees. **********The S.E.C. inquiry is examining possible illegal activities that have taken place at Treasury auctions since July 12, 1990 -- far earlier than the first violation that was admitted this month by Salomon. That violation took place at the December auction last year. **********Many of the requests for information deal with any collaborative arrangements that would indicate an effort to purchase secretly more than the legal maximum for a firm -- 35 percent of any single auction.  A Line of Inquiry: 'Parking' **********The request for documents indicates that the S.E.C. suspects the Salomon scandal could involve \"parking,\" the same violation that was at the heart of the scandal that brought down Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in the 1980's. Parking is a practice in which the true owner of a security is hidden through an arrangement with another party, allowing the owner to avoid reporting and other legal requirements. **********In its letter, the S.E.C. asked for documents that relate to \"the submission of false bids at any auction for U.S. Treasury securities or any parking or similar arrangements.\" **********That line of inquiry is focusing on whether firms may have submitted bids in customers' names with an agreement that the firm, not the customer, would be the true owner of any securities purchased. Such an arrangement could allow a firm to buy more than 35 percent of the securities. Deadline of Aug. 29 **********Salomon has admitted submitting bids in the names of customers who had not authorized or approved the orders. **********The S.E.C. is also seeking any information that would indicate that any customers of the primary dealers had submitted bids for any single Treasury auction at a single yield level that would exceed the 35 percent maximum. **********In addition, the inquiry is examining whether any firms have maintained \"overstated, excessive or inaccurate information\" in their records. **********The S.E.C. appears to be trying to gather the information quickly in its inquiry. Despite the breadth of its request, the commission has set an Aug. 29 deadline for voluntary compliance with the requests for information."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/03/world/us-officials-believe-iraq-will-take-years-to-rebuild.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1991-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2077, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Officials Believe Iraq Will Take Years to Rebuild", "print_headline": "U.S. Officials Believe Iraq Will Take Years to Rebuild", "body_text": " **********Three months after the Persian Gulf war devastated Iraq's military and many of its civilian industries, the country remains seriously incapacitated, facing a potentially catastrophic health crisis this summer and many years of rebuilding its civilian economy, Bush Administration analysts say. **********A comprehensive assessment of the damage from the intense 43-day allied bombardment remains classified within the Administration, which has been reluctant to divulge details. But an overview of the damage to key sectors of Iraq's economy emerged in recent days from a series of interviews with Administration analysts, who agreed to discuss it if they were not identified. **********The assessment indicates that Iraq's electrical power industry may have been damaged well beyond the intentions of allied war planners, who developed a still-secret weapon that dropped thousands of metallic filaments onto the electrical network at key points to create huge short-circuits and blackouts on the night of January 17th, when the war began. This was followed by precision strikes on power plants. Most Power Still Out **********Even now, 80 percent of the the nation's power grid is out of service, and electrical shortages are aggravating the crisis in health care. **********In addition, allied warplanes wrecked Iraq's civilian telecommunications system, described as a total loss by one estimate; and the bombing campaign seriously damaged the national network of roads and bridges, crippling commerce in a nation that straddles two major river valleys, those of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Generally, the war damage seems less visible in Baghdad than in many areas of the countryside. **********The critical sector of oil production, the dynamo that drives Iraq's economy, requires a major infusion of cash, about $1.5 billion, to get its export pipelines going at prewar levels; and Iraq may not be able to maintain its gasoline production without Western technology, spare parts and expertise in the near term. Because of the international trade sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait, however, Iraq has been unable to import urgently needed equipment and has not sold a cargo of oil, its principal source of income, since last August. **********One of the major mysteries remains how many Iraqi soldiers and civilians died. United States intelligence agencies assert that they have not addressed this question and the Bush Administration has not indicated any official interest. **********Intelligence officers connected with the United States Central Command conducted what they described as a purely mathematical exercise at the end of the war to estimate Iraqi war dead by subtracting prisoners of war and an assumed percentage of deserters and then assigning a mortality rate to those Iraqis who remained on the battlefield. **********By this method, the command derived an unofficial death toll of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, was said to have provided this unofficial tally in private briefings to members of Congress. **********Some analysts have questioned this unofficial number, arguing that the United States estimate of 540,000 Iraqi troops in the war zone overstated the size of Iraqi forces and that desertion rates were underestimated. They also argued that such a large number of battle deaths would have been accompanied by at least as many wounded, and that no evidence of this has been detected by foreign relief agencies working with Iraq's medical system. **********The Iraqi Government has not come forward with any authoritative estimate of war dead. Other unofficial estimates of Iraqi war dead have put the figure at 25,000 to 50,000.  Civilian Death Toll **********Allied war planners sought to minimize civilian deaths in Iraq, though there were notable mistakes, including the attack on an air raid shelter in Baghdad that apparently killed more than 300 civilians. **********A report issued this month by the environmental group Greenpeace estimated the number of Iraqi civilians killed during the war at 5,000 to 15,000, based on a review of statements by allied officials and other unofficial sources. **********Overall, the American analysts say, the Iraqis are struggling precariously under a patchwork of short-term fixes and remedies that will probably deteriorate in the months ahead if the Bush Administration maintains trade sanctions in an effort to force President Saddam Hussein from power.  Similarity to U.N. Report **********The Bush Administration's internal findings parallel those reported by a special United Nations mission to Iraq in March, which concluded that because of the damage inflicted on it, \"Iraq has, for some time to come, been relegated to a pre-industrial age, but with all the disabilities of post-industrial dependency on an intensive use of energy and technology.\" **********Some Administration officials had criticized the United Nations report, prepared under the supervision of Under Secretary General Martti Ahtissari, for describing the damage to Iraq with terms like \"near apocalyptic.\" But in their detailed review of each sector of Iraq's economy, the United Nations and United States assessments are not dissimiliar. **********The Central Intelligence Agency estimates a national repair bill in Iraq of up to $30 billion, about half of which would have to come from hard currency earnings on resumed shipments of oil to world markets. Add to this the $8 billion Iraq owes this year on its $80 billion in national debt, none of which has been paid, and a yet-to-be-determined bill for war reparations to Kuwait, and the outline of Iraq's post-war economic crisis takes an ominous shape, with or without Mr. Hussein.  Risks of U.S. Policy **********Some analysts within the Administration suggested that its policy of maintaining sanctions was a risky course, both because of its impact on the Iraqi people and because it may backfire or fail. **********One senior analyst said that as the Bush Administration discovered last fall when sanctions did not dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, there is no direct linkage between economic pain and political change in a police state like Iraq. This makes a sanctions-based strategy \"inherently unpredictable,\" he said. **********\"To the extent Iraqis are convinced that life will be abnormal and harsh as long as Saddam is around, that is clearly an incentive for change,\" the senior analyst said. \"But in a regime based on fear, the primordial interests of survival suggest that people would rather go hungry than take the risk of being dead.\" **********United States analysts say they do not know how much Mr. Hussein has in the way of hard currency to buy food and medicine in the short term, which he has been permitted to do since the United Nations began allowing humanitarian shipments on March 22. While $4 billion of Iraqi cash is frozen in foreign banks, they say Iraq is close to exhausting its cash reserves. **********At the outset of the war, the Bush Administration said its objectives included the elimination of Iraq's offensive war making ability and weapons of mass destruction. But in carrying out a strategy to achieve these goals, the Pentagon appears to have miscalculated the multiplying effects on public health of its large-scale destruction of Iraq's electricial power system, which fed civilian as well as military industries. **********The system powered water purification and sewage treatment plants, the loss of which led to a sharp increase in disease during and after the war. **********A report issued by a Harvard University study team this month said that \"the collapse of electrical generating capacity has been a crucial factor in this public health catastrophe.\" The team predicted tens of thousands of additional war-related deaths by the end of the year, a finding the Administration has not disputed. **********\"Without electricity, hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed,\" the study team's report said. Short-Circuiting Power System **********Many of Iraq's electrical power plants were struck on the first night of the allied air war. Iraqi engineers and technicians later told Western visitors that allied warplanes dropped thousands of metallic filaments onto electrical transformers and power lines, causing a spectacular short-circuiting process. **********\"It was really metallic threads, like a person's hair, very fine,\" said Julia Devin, a member of the Harvard team that toured Iraq in late April and early May and who returned with samples of the filaments collected from Iraqi plant technicians. **********An Air Force official this week confirmed the description of the attack. **********Tomahawk cruise missiles and guided bombs dropped from warplanes thereafter destroyed individual generating units, and these repeated attacks knocked out half of the country's generating capacity and damaged a large part of the other half, according to one Administration analysis. **********An Iraqi official last week said engineers had restored 1,580 megawatts of generating capacity out of what Western officials say was a prewar level of about 9,000 megawatts. **********The Iraqi Government announced this week that eight-hour daily blackouts will be a continuing feature even where electricity has been restored in major cities. Many smaller towns and villages still are without electricity. **********The longer term prospects for repairing the system may deteriorate due to the country's lack of access to Western technology, spare parts and expertise. Communications Badly Hit **********Of equally high priority on the allied target list was Iraq's telecommunications sector. Bombers struck telephone exchanges, microwave relay stations and cable networks, along with dedicated military links. **********The multibillion-dollar telecommunications system that Iraq had built with state-of-the-art Western technology is the most severely damaged segment of Iraq's civilian economy, United States analysts say. **********\"The Iraqis are going to have to completely rebuild the system and they cannot do it without foreign equipment and expertise,\" said one analyst. **********While some telephone and telex circuits to the outside world and among major Iraqi ministries and military complexes have been restored, most Iraqis are likely to be without telephone service for the foreseeable future.  Oil Production Resumed **********Iraq resumed oil production in April and, according to a Central Intelligence Agency estimate, could be exporting one million barrels per day -- about a third of its prewar production level -- by summer's end if sanctions are lifted. With a $1.5 billion investment in new pumps for its export pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia, Iraq could be exporting 2.7 million barrels per day by the end of 1992, according to the C.I.A. estimate. **********Refining oil for domestic gasoline consumption has been more problematical. Most major refineries suffered serious damage and Iraqi engineers will need foreign assistance and parts to repair them. **********Repairs at two large refineries enabled Iraq to lift gasoline rationing this month, but United States analysts say they are not sure the country can maintain gasoline output without access to spare parts and chemical additives produced outside the country. Damage to Transportation **********Iraq's highway and rail system is pocked by bomb craters and downed bridges. About 40 major bridges across the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers will have to be replaced, which can probably be done without foreign assistance, analysts say. Another 10 bridges are seriously damaged. **********Perhaps as important as this damage, Iraq's only tire factory, whose output served the whole country until it shutdown last fall, remains idled by lack of access to imported raw materials. **********Though Iraqi military engineers have worked around much of the damage with temporary bridges, transportation disruptions and bottlenecks, especially in southern Iraq around Basra, will have a significant impact on traffic and distribution for many months if not years.  Public Health Endangered **********The threat to public health in Iraq is of great concern to international relief agencies and health experts. Daily power blackouts are causing re-contamination of some drinking water supplies and threaten the country's ability to operate sanitary hospital wards and operating rooms, where refrigeration of drugs, vaccines and blood is of critical importance. **********Some back-up generators have failed for lack of fuel and parts. **********United States analysts said the compounding effect of continued poor sanitation in many parts of the country, the onset of summer heat and shortages of doctors and nurses could speed the growth of cholera, typhoid and gastroenteritis that may already have claimed tens of thousands of lives. Many foreign health workers left Iraq before and during the war and have not returned. **********Inflation has priced baby formula above the income level of many poor families, and transportation problems along with the closing of many regional health clinics have seriously retarded the level of health care services.Increasing child mortality is the most serious concern, public health experts and relief officials say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/business/company-news-boise-cascade-may-cut-dividend.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1991-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boise Cascade May Cut Dividend", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Boise Cascade May Cut Dividend", "body_text": " **********Boise Cascade, the world's eighth-largest paper producer, plans to sell more assets, and could lower its dividend to reduce debt.

New Group Wins 9 Seats **********According to preliminary results from the voting on Saturday, the New Front for Democracy, an alliance of traditional, ethnic-based parties that have long dominated civilian politics in Suriname, won 29 of 51 legislative seats in an orderly election. **********The New Democratic Party won 13 seats, a dramatic improvement from its performance in 1987, shortly after its formation, when it won only 3 seats. The party was created by the political wing of the military after international and domestic pressure forced Comdr. Desi Bouterse to relinquish power he seized in a 1980 coup. **********The New Democractic Party was installed in government after another coup by Commander Bouterse's soldiers last December.

Several said they were strongly warned against trying to involve the Netherlands in efforts to restructure the army or oust Commander Bouterse. **********Amid speculation that the Netherlands, the United States and some neighboring countries might collaborate in a plan to remove Commander Bouterse, the politicians said they were warned that they could easily be found and killed before any such intevention could take place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/22/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-013791.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Jardine Wines and Spirits and Societe Jas Hennessy & Co. to Leo Burnett Kyodo-Tokyo, for advertising in Japan for its Hennessy and Jardine brand alcoholic beverages.

Many coalition and United Nations officials, as well as human rights groups, feared that President Saddam Hussein's forces would kill Iraqis who rebelled or fled once American and Saudi forces abandoned the areas, as they are required to do eventually under the cease-fire agreement. U.S. Is Reported Relieved **********\"We will not withdraw our forces until those refugees who do not wish to return home are safely transferred to the camp in Saudi territory,\" the Prince declared. **********He indicated that the Iraqis would be welcome in the camp as long as they feared to go home. He did not say whether they would be permitted to work in the kingdom, and given Saudi Arabia's traditional reluctance to grant foreigners citizenship, it is unlikely that these refugees will become Saudi nationals. **********Prince Khalid said that he informed the United Nations and the United States military today of Saudi Arabia's decision to accept all Iraqi refugees unwilling to return to their homes. He said they seemed to greet the decision \"with great relief.\" **********He said the Saudi Government was discussing the fate of refugees of other nationalities, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the United Nations refugee agency. The kingdom is willing to help pay for the return of those refugees to their countries if that is necessary, he said. **********Prince Khalid also disclosed that a week ago he had stopped the return of about 1,000 Iraqi prisoners of war who wanted to return to Iraq pending the resolution of a longstanding dispute with Iraq over seven Saudi citizens for whom Iraq has not accounted.  'We Don't Believe Them' **********He said Saudi Arabia had previously permitted 1,096 of the 4,000 Iraqi officers and some 50,000 Iraqi soldiers to return to Iraq even though Baghdad said it could not locate the seven Saudis -- a pilot, two officers and four civilians. **********\"But we don't believe them,\" he said. \"We have reported our concern over the seven to the Red Cross. And Iraq must now search until they find our nationals, or discover what happened to them before more Iraqi officers return.\" **********He said that only three of the six prisoner of war camps were still operating. **********Prince Khalid, who is the son of Prince Sultan ibn Abdel-Aziz, Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister, stressed that in building the new refugee camp Saudi Arabia was not seeking to encourage Iraqis to leave their country. **********He said the kingdom was prepared to supply Iraqi villages currently controlled by Saudi or American forces with water and food and \"whatever they need\" to discourage Iraqis from abandoning their homes. **********\"But most of the people now in camps do not want to go back,\" he said. \"They fear that as long as Saddam Hussein is in power they will be killed.

But behind the promise to strike back hard when the time is right lay the clear suggestion that Israel would do nothing for now in deference to the United States' concern that an Israeli response could shatter the anti-Iraq military coalition in the Persian Gulf war. **********The Israelis said they would withhold retaliation for now in part because the United States had rushed several batteries of Patriot antimissile missiles to Israel today, and that one of them was already in operation.  Operated by American Crews **********The Pentagon said a Patriot shot down an Iraqi missile in flight as it headed for an airfield in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on Friday morning, the same morning that eight Iraqi missiles hit in the Tel Aviv-Haifa area. **********Four more Iraqi missiles slammed into heavily populated areas along Israel's coastal heartland early this morning. But once again, the 500-pound conventional warheads were reported to have killed no one, and they slightly injured about 15 civilians. Israeli officials put that down to remarkable luck, which they do not expect to hold should Iraq strike again. **********The Patriot batteries in Israel are manned by American crews, the first time that Americans have been deployed in Israel in its defense. Israeli crews have been in the United States for weeks, training in the operation of the Patriots in a program that began late last year. But they are not ready to use them. **********President Bush called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir twice to express concern about the second Iraqi attack and to reiterate his hope that Israel would rely on the United States to retaliate.  [ Page 16 ] **********The Americans \"understand the distress we are in,\" David Ivri, director general of the Defense Ministry, said this evening, \"and they try to make it possible for us not to respond.\" **********Israel retains the right to respond, he and others stressed today. \"But together with that,\" Mr. Ivri said, \"everyone knows that our response can change the whole procedure of the war in the Middle East.\" **********Speaking of the deployment of the Patriot missiles, a spokesman for the Israeli Army said: \"The aim of this swift supply is for immediate operation of these batteries in Israel. They are already put into place.\" **********In Washington, the Pentagon held a news conference to draw attention to the new aid program, and to the fact that Israel is now sharing information with the United States on Iraqi missile activity. **********Israelis were roused three times during the early-morning hours and ordered into their safe rooms, where they strapped on gas masks. The three early alerts proved to be false alarms. But a fourth alert, at dawn, foretold an actual strike. Two minutes after the sirens' warbling wail, three Iraqi Scud-B missiles fell in Tel Aviv while a fourth fell farther south along the coast, the army said. **********There were reports that another fell near Jerusalem at the same time, but they were never confirmed. One of those that hit Tel Aviv crashed through a three-story building in a city business district but did not explode.  Fired From Western Iraq **********The army said the Iraqi missiles that fell here this morning had been fired from western Iraq, where American and allied warplanes have been conducting extensive search-and-destroy operations to remove the mobile launchers from operation. **********\"It's clear,\" a senior military official said this afternoon, \"that the Americans will not be able to get them all, even within a matter of days.\" Military officials reported that at least 30 fixed and 20 mobile missile launchers remained intact and hidden in Iraq, despite the extensive allied effort to destroy them. **********As a result, military officials warned Israelis -- a people already dragging from three days under siege -- that they should expect more missiles over the next several nights and possibly Iraqi fighter-bomber raids as well. As of 10 P.M. tonight, there had been two more false alarms. **********Schools will be closed for the fourth day Sunday, and Israelis will once again be advised to stay at home, essentially shutting down the nation. **********Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the chief army spokesman and the military's voice to the Israeli people throughout this crisis, warned: \"I would say that, even though all the missiles launched so far have used conventional warheads, we should expect them to use chemical weapons as well. The fact that they haven't used them doesn't mean they don't have them.\" **********The few Israelis who have dared leave their homes against the army's advice these last three days carry their gas masks as routinely as they might hold purses or briefcases in normal times. **********Senior members of the Government today reiterated their threat that Israel would respond, and harshly.   Problems With Retaliation **********But it became clear today that Israel's air force would not simply send fighter planes off in a quick retaliatory strike. With so many warplanes already in operation over Iraq, Israel's fighters might be lost among all the others in the sky, officials suggested, or worse, get into unintended combat with allied warplanes. **********So Israeli officials said they would wait, watch, study and choose their target carefully, then act only when they see they can make a spectacular impact. **********\"We're not saying what we will do, when we will do it, where or how we will do it,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a news briefing this afternoon. **********And Eliahu Ben-Elissar, chairman of the Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, added: \"We won't appear for a meeting with Saddam Hussein where Saddam Hussein wants to meet us. But one thing should be clear: When we choose our target, it will be very, very painful.\" **********Today's strike, as Friday's, proved once again that Iraq's modified Scud-B missiles are more instruments of terror than weapons that can seriously threaten the security of the state. **********Officials have released no details about the missile that fell south of Tel Aviv, except to say that it injured no one. And one of the three missiles hitting Tel Aviv landed in a city park and did little more than scatter dirt across an adjacent road. **********Another missile blew open an underground concrete bomb shelter in a poor, working-class neighborhood of Tel Aviv, close to where one of the missiles fell during the first strike on Friday morning. But the shelter was empty. **********The last missile fell three stories through an empty apartment building before crashing to the floor in a ground-level jewelry store. It did not explode, and through the morning residents of the surrounding area were confined to their homes while army sappers defused the device. **********With the task completed just after noon, soldiers in a loudspeaker truck cruised the neighborhood broadcasting the message: \"To all residents -- it is all right to go back to normal life. Good afternoon.\" Their voices had a sarcastic tone. **********At the site, soldiers then began dragging the six-foot warhead out of the store as boisterous crowds laughed and jeered, pushing to get close enough so they could actually touch the dull gray cone, battered but largely intact despite its long journey. **********\"Look, look at Saddam's missile,\" several people chanted as the shell swung on its tether while a crane hoisted it onto an flatbed army truck. **********The crowd laughed as the truck hauled the missile away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/business/financial-executive-is-suspended.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1991-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Financial Executive Is Suspended", "print_headline": "Financial Executive Is Suspended", "body_text": " **********Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said yesterday that it had suspended its chief financial officer, saying he had been involved in a kickback scheme. **********The organization said the officer, David Granston, was suspended after an investigation into an arrangement Mr. Granston had with a broker to share commissions for the purchase by Consumers Union of Government mortgage-backed securities, known as Ginnie Maes. **********\"We have reason to believe that a crime or crimes may have been committed,\" Consumers Union said in a statement. **********Mr. Granston could not be reached for comment. **********Consumers Union said it made inflated commission payments between 1986 and 1991 and that the amount involved was several hundred thousand dollars. **********\"Our organization is so based on ethics and integrity,\" said David C.

Baker 3d's contingent said they would probably have to come up with ideas of their own to break the impasse. **********Unlike the talks between Israel and the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, which agreed to discuss Palestinian self-rule, there was no such accord between the representatives of Syria and Israel. The Optimistic Reading **********The only mildly encouraging development was a departure statement by the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who said he believed that the Israeli people wanted peace but that their Government was blocking the way. **********\"I think the Israelis as a people desire peace,\" he said. \"They are looking for peace. Israel is a special case, where the Government is more hawkish than the people. In the Arab world, it is just the opposite. We are more flexible than the Arab people.\" **********The Syrian official spoke to reporters after five hours of direct talks with Israeli representatives. Both sides said that these first contacts had made no progress but also said they were committed to continuing direct talks when and if they could agree on a site.  Taking Time to Consider **********American aides said they would take time out from the discussions to let the Mideast adversaries digest the implications of what has happened so far, and try to hammer out a compromise on where the next round of direct talks should take place. **********The Israelis want discussions to alternate between towns in their country and in Arab lands. The Syrians, Palestinians, Jordanians and Lebanese want them held in Madrid, under the umbrella of this conference, or in some other neutral site outside the Mideast. It is expected that Mr. Baker will invite the negotiating parties to Washington sometime in the next month. **********Although Mr. Sharaa's departure remarks today were considered highly polemical, Arab journalists present said they could not recall such an overture to the Israeli people from the hard-line Syrians. **********Mr. Sharaa, however, does not seem to have been suddenly transformed by the contact with Israel here. His comments appear to have been prompted, at least in part, by the negative publicity he received in the Western press for his behavior and remarks in Madrid. **********The Syrian had held up an old \"wanted\" photograph of the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, during Mr. Shamir's underground days, and also engaged in vitriolic exchanges with the Israelis. Today, throughout his news conference, Mr. Sharaa took pains to say that his comments had been misunderstood by the Western news media. **********Of all the delegations in Madrid, the Syrians were the least experienced in dealing with the public and the press.  They tried to avoid calling on Israeli reporters during news conferences and often issued handwritten statements, while the Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians and Lebanese were running off copies in several languages. **********Some Syrian journalists said privately that they were embarrassed, and predicted that their closed society would have to open a bit if Syria intended to compete in the game of public diplomacy with Israel and the Palestinians. **********On the substance of Sunday night's face-to-face contacts, Syrians and Israelis were in full agreement: Each heard nothing from the other that suggested a compromise was possible. **********The Syrian team was headed by an experienced former diplomat, Muwaffaq al-Allaf, while the Israelis were led by the Egyptian-born Yossi Ben Aharon, director general of Prime Minister Shamir's office, a man known for hard-line views. **********The Syrians said their negotiating strategy had been to keep repeating that they were not ready to discuss the substance of peace unless Israel first committed itself to withdrawing from the territories captured in the 1967 war, and particularly the Golan Heights. **********The Israelis said they were trying to persuade the Syrians to open direct communication outside the talks, and to discuss small, confidence-building gestures each side might take, before trying to deal with the territorial issue.  Dialogue at Cross-Purposes **********\"It was in every respect futile,\" Mr. Ben Aharon said afterward, \"because what they kept telling us constantly was 'When will you withdraw from the territories?' **********\"We invited them them to Israel,\" he recounted. \"They said no. **********\"We asked them to establish a link between us. They said no. **********\"We asked them to sign a peace treaty. They said no. **********Mr. Ben Aharon continued: \"We asked if they accepted the legitimacy of Israel, even in Tel Aviv, and they said it is not a relevant issue now. They refused any other venue for the talks other than Madrid and would not go anywhere in the Middle East. **********\"We said, 'Why don't we host you? Wouldn't you want us in Syria so your people will change their minds about us?' He kept saying that 'Once you withdraw, everything will be resolved.' \" **********Members of the Israeli delegation described the Syrian negotiators as professional, armed with briefing papers, well versed in all the relevant United Nations documents, but extremely standoffish. There were no handshakes, and the two sides took their coffee breaks in separate rooms. **********Mr. Sharaa, who did not personally take part in the talks, said after briefings by his negotiators that \"the Israeli delegates rejected all the requirements for peace; the Israeli head of delegation talked about everything other than the land that has been occupied for 24 years.\" **********He added: \"The equation in our region is very clear. The Syrian delegate spoke about both land and peace. The Israeli delegate dropped the land, kept it under the feet of their soldiers, and spoke only empty rhetoric about peace.\" **********Nevertheless, said Mr. Sharaa, \"our delegates will continue to resume the bilateral talks, and, of course, we are waiting for the co-sponsors to come up with a proposal for the next venue. We don't think our presence in the peace conference or ensuing negotiations is a waste of time.\" **********American officials say the Syrian-Israeli discussion, if it is to make progress, will require the greatest amount of mediation and other intervention, since neither side has any pressing need to compromise. **********Secretary Baker, who left Madrid on Sunday night and flew with President Bush today to California, said: \"We're encouraged that the talks took place at all. They were businesslike and carried off in a constructive atmosphere. No one walked out in the conference or the bilateral.

The new rules allow companies to make retirement plan contributions based on an employee's age, permitting a much larger share of contributions for those closest to retirement. Some experts say the rules are the most important change since 401(k) plans were introduced 10 years ago. **********Most of the attention is focused on small businesses, where the new rules allow an eye-popping disparity in retirement plan contributions for younger, lower-paid workers and older, highly compensated workers. For example, a 25-year-old might get a $200 contribution while the owner gets $30,000. **********The changes apply to defined-contribution plans, so named because the amount being contributed to the plan is defined while the ultimate benefit is not. **********The dollar limit on contributions to these plans is $30,000 a year, under both the new and the old rules. Small-business owners typically want to contribute the $30,000 maximum for themselves. **********Under the old rules, if that represented 15 percent of the owner's salary, the owner typically had to contribute 15 percent of each employee's salary as well. But the new rules might allow the owner to contribute as little as 1 percent for younger employees while making the full contribution for the owner's own account -- provided there is enough age difference to make the formula work. This allows the business owner to substantially reduce the total amount of money being contributed to the retirement plan. **********For example, Andrew M. Wray 3d, a financial planner in Memphis, has a client with a six-person company who was contributing $72,000 to the retirement plan in order to get his own $30,000 contribution. Under the new rules, he can contribute a total of just $37,000 while still getting his own $30,000 contribution. **********\"It can decrease the total contribution the employer is making by 40 to 60 percent without decreasing his own contribution,\" Mr. Wray said. **********What's more, age-weighted plans that are also profit-sharing plans do not require a contribution every year, as do other major retirement plans. Employers who have this type of age-weighted plan can skip a year or two of contributions -- an option that is particularly appealing to employers in the current sour economy. **********This type of plan \"is so exciting because it fills the need on the part of the business owner to reward more senior, longer-service employees and it offers the flexibility of making a lower contribution or none at all in bad times,\" said David I. Gensler, an actuary at Madison Pension Services Inc. in White Plains. \"Part of the beauty is that the employer is not committed to putting the money in.\" **********The age-weighted plans cost less to administer, too, and require no employer contribution to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. That is the Government agency that insures the defined-benefit plans, which, in contrast to defined-contribution plans, promise to deliver a set payout on retirement. **********Nor does the age-weighted plan require the employer to make quarterly contributions as defined-benefit plans do. Instead, contributions are made just once a year. **********Not everyone is happy with the new rules, of course. Some experts have pointed out that younger, lower-paid employees are getting the short end of the stick. **********\"You can put away $30,000 for yourself and peanuts for everybody else,\" said Richard R. Joss, actuary at the Wyatt Company, benefits consultants in Washington. **********Supporters of the plans argue that in many cases younger employees would prefer to receive their dollars as salary, rather than having the money tucked away out of their control for 40 years. Whether the dollars saved from the pension contributions actually get turned into higher pay remains a question, of course. **********But, the supporters say, if a retirement plan turns out to be too expensive for small-business owners, many will just abandon it and tuck money away just for themselves, \"leaving employees out altogether,\" Mr. Wray said. **********Planners say that small-business owners should consider the age-weighted plans if there is a significant difference between the age of the owner and those of other key employees and staff members. \"The higher the compensation, the older the employee, the more benefit\" to the owner for using the plans, Mr. Wray said. **********Larger employers are interested in age-weighted plans, too, said Allen T. Steinberg, a partner at Hewitt Associates, benefits consultants in Lincolnshire, Ill. **********For example, an employer who is cutting back on retiree medical benefits might use such a plan to give those employees closest to retirement some extra money to help make up for what is being taken away. **********\"There are a number of reasons you might want to target money to older employees,\" Mr. Steinberg said. \"For large companies, it will be more of a niche tool.\"JUST HOW THE RULES APPLY **********Congress bans employers from giving relatively more in benefits to higher-paid workers than to lower-paid ones and the Internal Revenue Service issues regulations that tell employers how they must test benefits plans to show compliance. **********It is the latest regulations on nondiscrimination testing, out last month, that set up the rules for age-weighted retirement plans. Key to the plan is the concept of cross testing, which allows employers to test a defined-contribution plan, like the age-weighted plan, based on the eventual benefits to be paid rather than on current contributions. **********Consider this example, provided by Andrew Wray, a Memphis planner. One employee is 50 years old and earns $150,000. Her employer contributes $30,000 to the retirement plan this year on her behalf. Here's how the test works: If the money earns 8 1/2 percent until she reaches 65, she will have $102,000 from this year's contribution. With that money, she can buy an annuity at age 65 that will pay her $12,800 a year for life. This benefit amounts to 8 1/2 percent of her compensation at age 50. **********Another employee is 35. He earns $40,000 and has 30 years to retirement. The contribution made to the retirement plan for him is $2,400. If the money earns the same 8 1/2 percent, this employee will have a balance of $27,000 at retirement from this year's contribution. He can then buy an annuity with annual payments of $3,400. This is 8 1/2 percent of his compensation at age 35. **********\"The I.R.S. is saying, as long as the benefit is the same in proportion to your salary, it's O.K.,\" Mr. Wray said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/business/open-positions-on-short-sales-increase-2.9-on-big-board.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 8641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics; List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Open Positions on Short Sales Increase 2.9% on Big Board", "print_headline": "Open Positions on Short Sales Increase 2.9% on Big Board", "body_text": " **********Short-sale figures are reported monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers and represent the \"short interest\" for that period.Figure Drops by 5% on American Exchange **********The American Stock Exchange also reported its short-interest figures yesterday, showing a decline of 3.5 million shares, or 5%, to 67.1 million for the period ended Dec. 13, from 70.6 million on Nov. 15.

Sears is expected to report sharply reduced earnings on Feb. 11 for the fourth quarter and last year. That is the same day its board gathers in Chicago for a two-day meeting.  Problems With Profits **********Founded in 1887, the Sears catalogue has the largest revenues of any mail-order business, but retail specialists say it has not been profitable for two years. Once a staple in millions of American homes the Sears catalogue presaged the opening of Sears stores. **********But it lost ground in recent years to specialty catalogues, which offer a narrower selection of merchandise, and to discount retail stores, which are able to change prices quickly. Sears catalogue prices must be set months in advance in order to meet printing and mailing schedules. **********In 1988, Montgomery Ward & Company closed its catalogue operation, which was the oldest in the country, and benefited by being able to divert the operation's expenses to supporting and expanding its stores. The J. C. Penney Company would have the largest catalogue business in the country if Sears closed down its catalogue, and some of Penney's people have been saying that its catalogue was doing better than Sears's and would soon be the largest.  Sears Declines to Comment **********Sears officials declined to comment on the industry reports that significant new changes were likely. \"We do not respond to speculation,\" said a corporate spokesman at headquarters in Chicago. **********Declining profits from the catalogue have hurt the Merchandising Group's bottom line, and retail analysts have maintained for the last several months that Sears was negotiating to sell the operation, possibly to a Japanese buyer. **********Selling the catalogue would bring Sears a cash infusion and remove a money-losing operation. But if Sears cannot sell the catalogue, analysts say, it might decide to close the operation altogether. **********\"The Sears catalogue business must be restructured because it is losing money and giving up market share to specialty catalogues, like those of Spiegel, Land's End and L. L. Bean,\" said Janet Mangano, research director for Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York. \"Previous actions on the catalogue haven't worked. It could be sold as a whole.\" Job Cuts and Refurbishing **********Early this month, the company said it would eliminate 21,000 jobs in its stores, primarily nonselling positions. It also said it was trying to cut other costs in its 800 large stores and refurbish them to make them more inviting to customers. **********One big problem, analysts say, is Sears's high cost of operations. About 30 percent of each $1 in sales goes to cover overhead, against 15 percent for Wal-Mart, which recently passed the K Mart Corporation to become the nation's second-largest retailer. **********Sears's board will consider a plan to cut costs by an additional $700 million to $800 million a year, said Walter F. Loeb, a New York financial analyst. The idea is to combine merchandising functions \"so that there are only two or three general merchandise managers instead of six, take some strong action on the catalogue and in general do a more comprehensive restructuring,\" he said.  Estimates of Sears Earnings **********Analysts predicted that Sears would report 1990 earnings well below those of 1989. They predicted net income of $2.60 a share, against $4.12 a share in 1989. They said they expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 to $1.10 a share, against $1.76 a share in the 1989 quarter. **********Those estimates embrace the entire company, which includes the Merchandising Group, Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services and Coldwell Banker Real Estate. **********The core Merchandising Group, which is the company's biggest sales-and-profit contributor as well as its biggest drag on earnings, is expected to report net income of about $30 million, or 10 cents a share, for the full year, against 1989 net income of $292 million, or 77 cents a share, Mr. Loeb, the analyst, said. Severe Reversal Expected **********Such a result would be a severe reversal from 1989, when the Merchandising Group earned $28 million in the first three quarters. By contrast it lost $119 million in 1990's first nine months. For the crucial fourth quarter, which included the Christmas shopping season, Mr. Loeb estimated that the group earned $120 million to $125 million, against $264 million last year. In 1989, the Merchandising Group accounted for 59 percent of sales and 51 percent of income. The company's 1990 annual report has not yet been issued. **********With the Merchandising Group's poor results and the company's failure so far to improve its fortunes much, heavy pressure has fallen on Edward A. Brennan, Sears's chairman and chief executive. In August, Mr. Brennan resumed his former role as chairman and chief executive of the Merchandising Group and has since been wearing two hats -- in corporate and merchandising. **********But retailing executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Brennan has enough support to be left in place for further attempts to turn Sears around. None who speculated that his tenure might be in jeopardy were willing to be quoted by name. Talk of Ouster Discounted **********Others discounted such talk. **********\"Ed Brennan is secure for now because he still has the directors behind him,\" said William N. Smith, retail analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. **********N. Richard Nelson, analyst for Duff & Phelps in Chicago, agreed that Mr. Brennan's job was safe and said it would take more time for him to prove his value to the company. \"I think he has not been in the retail job that long,\" he said, \"and the retailing environment has not been good.\" **********If Sears is unable to find a new strategy for its merchandising operation and is unable to sell its catalogue, it is possible it will resume merger talks with Montgomery Ward. **********Last August, Sears was approached by Ward to consider a possible merger of the Merchandising Group with Ward, but Sears's directors turned down the proposed consolidation. Ward, whose chairman, Bernard F. Brennan, is Edward Brennan's brother, expects soon to report record earnings for 1990. This week, Bernard Brennan said there was still a \"50-50 chance\" that talks could be renewed. **********Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank Group in New York, is convinced that \"a restructuring of Sears's retail business is a dire necessity and must be done sooner rather than later because its competitors are becoming stronger each year.\" . **********\"Wal-Mart's sales topped $32 billion in 1990 and will more than double by 1995,\" he continued. \"Category killers, like Circuit City, Home Depot and Toys 'R' Us, which have dominant merchandise assortments and low operating costs, will continue to expand.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/26/business/us-tariff-appears-to-backfire.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1991-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1047, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Tariff Appears to Backfire", "print_headline": "U.S. Tariff Appears to Backfire", "body_text": " **********A month and a half after the United States imposed a 63 percent tariff on the most advanced screens for laptop and notebook computers, the Japanese have begun to retaliate. **********Some companies have said they will stop sending the screens to the United States, and the Toshiba Corporation, one of the largest Japanese companies to make computers in the United States, has said it is moving its operations abroad to obtain the screens without paying the tariffs. **********Thus, the retaliation will hurt the many American computer makers that rely on the Japanese screens and could lead to a loss of American jobs.

Because they have no other choice than to buy their screens from Japan, the companies said, they must either raise prices for consumers or manufacture their machines outside the United States. (The tariff does not apply when the screen is imported to the United States as part of a larger computer system.) **********Paul C. Rosenthal, a Washington lawyer representing the American flat-panel display manufacturers that brought the dumping case, said it was unfair to blame the flat-panel display tariffs for moves toward manufacturing offshore. **********Mr. Rosenthal also noted that a study by the General Accounting Office released on Tuesday showed that American companies that rely on Japan for crucial components like flat-panel displays are often at a disadvantage because they cannot obtain the latest technology. **********Cydney L.

Other Japanese manufacturers, including the NEC Corporation, Japan's largest personal computer maker, will probably follow. **********Earlier this year, Toshiba reduced its work force in the United States by about 200 employees, from about 2,000. But the company said today that because only one laptop model was directly affected by the move back to Japan, no additional layoffs were expected. **********The largest maker of the screens affected by the tariff, the Hosiden Corporation of Osaka, said recently that it had stopped shipping its screens to American computer manufacturers. Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., is one of Hosiden's largest customers. **********\"Our customers do not want to pay the price of manufacturing their computers in the United States.\" said Hiroshi Yoshimura, director of Hosiden's planning division. **********Mr. Yoshimura declined to name Hosiden's customers. Apple, however, has repeatedly said it will move the manufacturing of its Macintosh portable computer from California to its plants in Singapore or Cork, Ireland. An Apple spokeswoman said today that no decision had been made. **********The Compaq Computer Corporation, based in Houston, said it was also thinking of moving production overseas, perhaps to Singapore. **********The 63 percent tariff on the flat-panel screens was approved by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission after an investigation that determined the Japanese makers were dumping screens -- selling them at unfairly low prices -- to seize most of the commercial market in the United States. **********One of the companies that may be hurt the most by the tariff is America's biggest computer maker: the International Business Machines Corporation. Earlier this year, I.B.M. began making active matrix screens in Japan in a joint venture with Toshiba. **********When the tariff decision was handed down, an I.B.M. spokesman called it \"an eviction notice from the U.S. Government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\" In fact, well before the tariff decision, I.B.M. turned over the development and production of its newest laptops to IBM Japan. **********Several Japanese manufacturers moved the final assembly of their laptop machines to the United States in recent years, primarily as a trade gesture. However, none have moved the most sophisticated part of the manufacturing process -- making the screens -- to American operations. Moving final assembly of the computers to the United States was also hastened by a 100 percent duty on Japanese-made laptops imposed by the Reagan Administration in retaliation for Japan's slowness in opening its semiconductor market. **********When a new semiconductor accord was signed several months ago, the 100 percent duty on finished computers was revoked. That made it as cheap to export laptops from Japan as it is to build them in America. Now that the United States has imposed the tariff on screens, it is now significantly cheaper to produce the machines in Japan.                    --------------------       Tandy-Matsushita Venture **********FORT WORTH, Sept. 25 (AP) -- The Tandy Corporation and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan said today that they had formed a joint venture to make laptop and notebook computers. **********Production is scheduled to start by February at an existing Tandy site in Fort Worth that will initially employ about 100 people. The joint venture, to be called PTCC Inc., will make products to be sold under Tandy's name and Grid label, as well as by Matsushita under its Panasonic and Victor brand names."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/03/business/rise-seen-in-hiring-in-3d-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rise Seen In Hiring in 3d Quarter", "print_headline": "Rise Seen In Hiring in 3d Quarter", "body_text": " **********Recent graduates and other job seekers may soon find that jobs are not so scarce. **********A survey of business hiring plans by Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary-employment agency, forecasts a notable upturn in the third quarter, which begins on July 1. Such a development is eagerly awaited by economists since a recovery cannot take hold as long as people are losing jobs and incomes. **********\"This is the first sign of a positive trend we've seen since the third quarter of 1989, when hiring projections began to slide,\" said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower, based in Milwaukee, which conducted the survey.  Expansion by 22 Percent **********The quarterly survey, published over the weekend, found that 22 percent of 15,000 businesses intended to expand their work forces during the summer while 10 percent planned to cut employment during the quarter, producing what Manpower called a net hiring strength factor of plus 12. **********This is considerably ahead of the first two quarters of 1990, when the strength factors were the lowest since 1982, and exceeded the normal jump for this time of year. **********When adjusted for seasonal variation, the latest figure of plus seven compares with plus one in the second quarter and represented what Manpower called the first trend reversal after nine straight quarters in which the strength factor either declined or remained unchanged. A Predictive Indicator **********Although employment itself is considered a coincident indicator of business conditions, shifting about the same time as the economy at large, the Manpower survey is regarded as a leading, or predictive, indicator since it deals with intentions. Mr. Fromstein said in an interview that these were usually carried out. \"What was projected usually happens,\" he emphasized. **********Another predictive labor market indicator, published each Thursday by the Labor Department, is the number of people who have filed initial claims for unemployment insurance. This series seems to have peaked in March, when claims soared above 500,000, well above the 450,000 level of recent weeks. **********The Government's monthly report on the labor market, covering May, is to be published on Friday. Analysts expect further modest payroll job losses, along with a probable uptick in the unemployment rate, which eased two-tenths of a point in April, to 6.6 percent. **********Manpower's hiring-strength figures do appear to have anticipated both the brief 1980 recession and the extended 1981-82 recession, though by far the weakest figures were in 1982. **********The survey, based on telephone interviews with public and private employers in 476 cities, has been conducted quarterly since 1976. **********The latest data showed improvement in all four geographic regions, including the sharply depressed Northeast, where responses remained at 1982 recession levels. **********Seasonally adjusted, the Northeast moved from a strength factor of minus seven to zero for the third quarter, with the Midwest improving from four to ten, the South from three to eight and the West from three to seven, according to supplementary Manpower data. Some Exceptions in Gains **********By types of business, all sectors except transportation, public utilities, education and public administration show strong recovery from the second-quarter lows, Manpower said. **********The most notable increases are expected to be in construction, the manufacture of nondurable goods and in wholesale and retail trades and services. **********Mr. Fromstein remained cautious, however, about the projected upturn in hiring. \"It is difficult at this early stage to predict a sustained recovery,\" he said. \"But the first step toward that result is clearly in evidence.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/19/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** First Security Corp. of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky., a bank holding company, named William R.

It's near. We can see it now much more than months ago.\"  Not Exactly Around the Corner **********Other Israelis are not so sure. In fact, many of them, perhaps most, would say that Ms. Sananes is naive, and that peace in this region is no more around the corner than a blizzard. **********Still, hawk and dove alike, they were delighted that Mr. Shamir had said on Thursday that Israel would attend the peace conference in October if the Government was satisfied with the makeup of the Palestinian delegation. **********An opinion poll published last week in the largest daily newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, suggested that three-fourths of the Israelis wanted their Government to accept the American peace initiative. Hard-liners opposed even to discussion of peace are few within the governing coalition, so it seems all but certain that Mr. Shamir will get the support he must have from his Cabinet when it meets on Sunday. Sharon Is Unhappy **********The only unhappy Cabinet minister from Mr. Shamir's Likud party is Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, the retired general and architect of the invasion of Lebanon, who has warned that the proposed conference would bring war with surrounding Arab countries instead of peace. **********\"When they bring us a proposal that is not to our liking and we refuse to accept it, they will accuse us of sabotaging the very conference that we have just accepted,\" he told the Israel radio. \"So what sort of negotiations are those?\" **********Historic negotiations, replied Abba Eban, the former Foreign Minister and elder statesmen. For President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to agree to sit at the same table with Israel is \"a historic turning point,\" Mr. Eban wrote in the newspaper Maariv, and \"an opportunity that will not recur.\" 'A Zionist Victory' **********\"Zionism has conquered the last of its opponents' fortresses,\" he said. \"When a regime like that of Assad reaches the conclusion, for self-centered reasons, that it must agree to Israel's demand for direct negotiations, that's a Zionist victory.\" **********Yet on the streets of Tel Aviv, where Iraqi missiles fell only a few months ago, even people who were pleased by the Shamir announcement, like Carmel Barazani, predicted that \"nothing will come of it.\" **********Mr. Barazani wears a pistol on his hip when he drives his taxi, insisting that it is a necessary precaution against possible terrorist attacks. Like many Israelis, he is convinced that the Arabs are not serious about negotiating and that they will make impossible demands. \"Nothing will happen,\" he said. \"No peace.\" **********If that turns out to be the case, at least a few people are already prepared to blame Mr. Shamir, who they say agreed to a peace conference only because he had no choice. The Americans were leaning on him hard, they argue, and it would have been difficult for him to say no when a month from now he will ask Washington for $10 billion in loan guarantees to help settle new Soviet immigrants. **********\"In the end, it's all business,\" said Omri Achai, a restaurant owner in downtown Tel Aviv. \"It's money. He needs help with so many Russians coming.\"  Confidence in Shamir **********\"But his position has been known for years,\" Mr. Achai said of Mr. Shamir, \"and he can't change overnight. He won't be the guy to give anything. It will be someone else after him.\" **********Round and round, in cafes and on Tel Aviv's beaches, the arguments swirl over how much territory, if any, Israel should give back to the Arabs. **********Miri Fabian, an actress who came to Israel from Czechoslovakia in 1949, would return it all -- East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, everything. **********\"It's a chance worth taking,\" she said. \"We've been a position of war for 40 years. Let's try it another way.\" **********But she acknowledges that she is in the minority. Far more people say that it is one thing to sit down at a negotiating table but quite another to yield territory. Not the Golan **********Even Ms. Sananes, who works for an automotive magazine, backed off after initially expressing a willingness to swap land for peace. Asked if that included the Golan Heights, from which Syrians used to fire onto Israeli settlements, she said no; national security would be compromised. **********Yitzhak Manshi, a 22-year-old soldier from Jaffa enjoying a day off at the beach, had no doubts on that point. **********\"I support Shamir -- it's good to talk,\" he said, shuffling cards on a deck chair. \"If they want peace, O.K. But peace for peace, not peace for land. We can give them Gaza and we can give them a mountain here or a mountain there somewhere else. But it is our territory.\" **********Nearby, David Birkhahn, a dentist from Jerusalem, said he did not understand why foreigners often consider Israelis intransigent when they hold such opinions. **********\"Other countries say that Israel stands in the way of peace, when it is the Arabs who do,\" said Dr. Birkhahn, who moved here from Ireland in 1959. \"Why should we give up territories for which we have spilled blood over 43 years of wars that were forced on us?\" **********Then why agree to talk at all? **********\"Because even though Arabs live in a realm of fantasy,\" he said, \"I still hope that they come back to earth and realize that peace in the Middle East is good for both sides.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/18/business/finance-briefs-484791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********DEBT * Los Angeles priced $150 million in Department of Water and Power electric-plant revenue bonds through Dillon, Read & Co. to yield from 5.60 percent for issues maturing in 1997, 6.625 percent for those due in 2014 and 6.734 percent for those due in 2031.

Annuities are contracts to pay cash over a period of time, usually in return for a single payment up front. **********Now, with Executive Life's financial condition deteriorating, largely because of losses in its huge portfolio of \"junk bonds,\" employees and retirees are worried that the insurer will not be able to meet its financial obligations and that their pensions will be slashed or even lost. **********\"I am angry about it,\" said Eli I. Schefer, a 71-year-old retired packaging engineer for Revlon Group Inc., which refinanced its pension plan with Executive Life annuities after it was acquired in 1985 by Ronald O. Perelman, the New York financier. **********\"A lot of us worked 35 or 40 years for a company, and when they did this their fiduciary responsibility went to the winds,\" said Mr. Schefer, who relies on his Revlon pension for 60 percent of his income. **********Mr. Schefer, who lives in Sands Point, L.I., said he went to Revlon's headquarters in Manhattan on Friday to speak with executives about the safety of the annuities. He added that he was assured that Revlon would stand behind all its pension obligations and that for now he had little choice but to trust Revlon. Calls to Revlon today went unanswered.  Junk Bonds From Drexel **********The issue has been particularly contentious at companies that stripped excess money from their pension funds after being acquired in hostile takeovers financed by junk bonds sold through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the defunct Wall Street firm. **********First Executive was one of the largest buyers of Drexel's junk bonds. In several cases, it bought junk bonds issued by Drexel in takeovers. When the companies' new owners refinanced the companies' pension plans to strip out excess funds, First Executive sold the companies annuities that effectively replaced their pension obligations by making monthly payments to retirees. **********One example is the Pacific Lumber Company, which was acquired by the Maxxam Corporation in a hostile takeover in 1986. First Executive bought $343 million in junk bonds issued by Drexel to finance the deal. Maxxam then bought annuities from Executive Life to refinance Pacific Lumber's pension plan, despite questions raised by Pacific Lumber executives about First Executive's financial strength. **********\"As you know, our employees are vitally interested in the quality of the company selected for the annuity contracts,\" Vincent C. Garner, a Pacific Lumber executive, wrote in a memorandum to Maxxam executives in 1986, just before the annuity business was awarded to Executive Life. \"If Executive Life is selected, I believe its investment philosophy and heavy concentration in junk bonds and its role in financing Drexel Burnham's deals, including the Pacific Lumber Company's purchase, will be major sources of concern to our employees.\" **********The memorandum, which is cited in a lawsuit filed a year and a half ago against First Executive and Maxxam by Pacific Lumber employees, stated that Executive Life submitted the lowest bid. The suit contends that Executive Life was awarded the pension annuity business in return for First Executive's role in financing the takeover by Maxxam. **********The fears of Pacific Lumber employees were crystalized last week when California regulators took over the management of Executive Life, citing a rapid drop in the value of the insurer's junk bond portfolio. \"It has everybody pretty well wound up and frightened,\" said John Maurer, a former Pacific Lumber employee who lives in Fortuna, Calif. \"This is our worst fears come home.\" **********Mr. Maurer said he and other current and former Pacific Lumber employees have been trying to reach elected officials in California seeking assurances that the interests of pension holders will be given a high priority should Executive Life not be able to meet all its obligations. **********Regulators and analysts said it was still too soon to know what losses, if any, pension holders might be exposed to, or whether their interests would be given priority over holders of life insurance policies, individual annuities or other investments sold by Executive Life."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/30/business/company-news-sears-officers-lose-bonuses.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sears Officers Lose Bonuses", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sears Officers Lose Bonuses", "body_text": " **********Sears, Roebuck & Company's top 12 officers, including the chairman, will not get bonuses for 1990 because of poor performance by the retail division, company records indicate. **********Without the bonus, the salary of the Sears chairman, Edward A.

Lots of people warned me not to appear in the film, not to take the risk.\" **********Released a few weeks ago and in most ways typical of the syrupy romance films that fill the movie houses of Pakistan and India, \"Henna\" is already being described as a landmark in the history of motion pictures on the subcontinent. **********It is as much a joint production on a major motion picture as the Indian and Pakistani film industries have ever seen, a Romeo and Juliet story with Romeo portrayed as an Indian Hindu -- and played Rishi Kapoor, who is one -- and Juliet a Pakistani Muslim by the name of Henna. It is also an enormous success on both sides of the border.  Of Land and Borders **********The movie was conceived by one of India's legendary film makers, the late Raj Kapoor, and directed by his son Randhir. Much of the dialogue was written by a respected Pakistani screenwriter, Haseena Moin. **********\"Henna\" is being promoted with the slogan: \"God made land. Man made borders.\" And the border portrayed in the film could not be more troublesome. **********The setting of \"Henna\" is Kashmir, the divided northern territory that has been the focus of two of the three wars fought between India and Pakistan since their partition by Britain in 1947. **********The Indian-Pakistani relationship is considered so incendiary a topic in the motion picture industry that only a handful of films that touch on it have ever been made in either country. **********That includes the subject of the 1947 partition, in which hundreds of thousands of people, Hindus and Muslims alike, were killed in weeks of religious rioting, and millions of others were forced to desert their homes and their livelihoods. Out of the partition was born the largely Hindu nation of India and the Muslim nation of Pakistan. **********Ms. Moin, who traveled to India from her home in Karachi to work on \"Henna,\" had her name removed from the credits before the film went into distribution, in part because of concern that \"Henna\" might be perceived as somehow pro-India. **********\"Relations between India and Pakistan are not as friendly as they should be,\" said Ms. Moin, who is Pakistan's best-known television writer. \"Kashmir is very controversial.\" **********\"In the film, a wealthy Indian businessman is struck on the subject of India and Pakistan,\" said Jameel Akhtar Khan, professor of language and literature at Karachi University. \"There are strong feelings on both sides. Film makers have not taken these risks.\"  Censors Ban a Play **********Novelists and book-writing historians have no reluctance to address the Indian-Pakistani relationship. But since more than half of the population in both India and Pakistan is illiterate -- an estimated 60 percent of the adults in India cannot read, 75 percent in Pakistan -- books often lack the audience to sway popular tastes. **********The fear among film makers, as well as theatrical and television producers, is largely a result of politics. **********Censor boards in both India and Pakistan monitor the political content of films and television programs. Earlier this year, censors in Karachi banned a well-reviewed play about the partition. **********There is the related concern over public taste and commercial appeal. Satish Anand, a Karachi film maker who is managing director of Eveready Pictures, said his competitors in Pakistan were just as concerned with the bottom line as their counterparts in Hollywood. **********\"I think people in the industry have thought in the past that the relationship between Pakistan and India was a risky subject, commercially risky,\" he said. The financial success of \"Henna,\" he said, may help change some of that thinking.  On Pirated Videotapes **********The antagonism between India and Pakistan extends to film distribution. Since the two nations went to war in 1965 over Kashmir, Indian films have not been shown in Pakistani theaters, nor Pakistan films in Indian cinemas. **********\"Henna,\" like most popular Indian films, is seen in Pakistan on pirated videotapes, which are available in every video shop in Karachi. **********\"Henna\" follows a formula typical for an Indian or Pakistani film, which, simply put, is to appeal to every possible audience. \"Henna\" is part love story, part action-adventure and part musical. The drama is interrupted frequently for bouts of singing and dancing. **********The film is unusual in that the dialogue is in two languages: Hindi, the dominant language in northern India, for the Indian characters, and Urdu, a major Pakistani language, for the scenes in Pakistan. The two languages are closely related and can be understood on either side of the border.  'Not a Political Movie' **********While some viewers are reading a political message into \"Henna,\" the director, Mr. Kapoor, insists he was only trying to make a film about the larger theme of tolerance. **********\"This is absolutely not a political movie,\" he said in a telephone interview from Bombay, the film-making capital of India. \"This film is about humanism and the need for people to overcome human barriers and borders.\" **********But Mr. Kapoor makes no money from the pirated videotapes sold in Pakistan, and he acknowledges that \"Henna\" may offer the chance to break down more than a quarter-century of film-distribution barriers between the two nations. **********He has requested a meeting with Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, to seek permission to show \"Henna\" in Pakistani theaters. **********\"The film has been immensely popular in India and Pakistan,\" he said. \"But in Pakistan, people have only seen it on video. I am proud of this film.

Mitchell of Maine, asked in the Democrats' response to President Bush's State of the Union Message, \"If we can make the best smart bomb, can't we make the best VCR?\"  A Mixed Answer **********Many people, including Senator Mitchell, say the answer should be yes. In addition to weaponry, the United States remains supreme in such technologies as supercomputers, software and biotechnology. If the nation were to devote as much effort to making cars and televisions as it does to producing missiles, this camp says, it might be possible to be more competitive in those areas where it is lagging behind. **********But many technology experts say the answer is not so simple. To begin with, they say, the weapons are not necessarily that sophisticated. Nor does the effort involved in making them translate automatically into success in commercial technology. **********Indeed, the nation's efforts to make weapons may hurt its competitiveness in other areas. Some executives say that because of the Pentagon mentality of striving for sophisticated technology at any cost, military technology has become irrelevant to economic competitiveness. In selling computers, television sets or automobiles, low cost and the ability to get to market quickly are as important as whiz-bang features. **********The Raytheon Corporation, for example, which built the Patriot anti-missile system that destroyed the Iraqi Scuds, has had a tough time in the consumer marketplace with its Caloric stoves and Speed Queen washing machines and dryers.  Future Debates **********The performance of the weapons in the Persian Gulf is likely to play a role in future debates about national priorities and how to restore competitiveness. In a number of interviews, technology executives, analysts and military systems experts agreed on these points: ***********Most weapons used in the war, including the Patriot and the Tomahawk, were developed more than 10 years ago, using technology far less sophisticated than that found in today's garden-variety personal computers. In that sense, the triumph of American weaponry in the war is not so much a sign of the nation's present prowess as it is a reminder of past ability. ***********While the Defense Department once pioneered in developing technology that later found commercial uses, the latest technology is now generally developed for nonmilitary applications; only later might it find its way into weapons. ***********Because of its loss of competitiveness in commercial technology, the United States cannot make some of its own weapons without help from other nations. A small but growing number of components and technologies in American weapons come from foreign suppliers, in some cases because there are no longer any American producers. **********Before the Persian Gulf war, a movement seemed to be building in the technology business and in Congress to redirect some Federal research and development spending away from purely military technology like the \"Star Wars\" anti-missile system and toward technologies with more civilian applications, like flat-panel monitors for use in television sets and computers. Whether the war will derail that movement is uncertain. **********For all the excitement over American weaponry, it is still too early to assess precisely how well the high technology performed. For every video clip of a smart bomb gliding into an airshaft, it is not known how many bombs went astray. And military analysts point out that Iraq was not the most technologically sophisticated opponent.  Good, but Expensive **********Still, even if the technology functioned as well as its ardent supporters say, consider the cost and time involved in building those weapons. Some $9.5 billion, for instance, has been spent on the Tomahawk cruise missile since 1972. Given such costs and time, some say, the weapons should work well. **********\"We're all proud of the Patriot's performance, but it costs a million dollars every time you push the button,\" said Jacques S. Gansler, a former Pentagon procurement official and author of \"Affording Defense.\" **********The military business, with its own goals and complex procedures, has evolved into a culture distinct from commercial business. Companies that excel in one arena often cannot excel in the other. **********Some executives and analysts go further, arguing that weapons development has actually hurt the nation's competitiveness by siphoning off research dollars and engineers that could have been developing commercial products. Where Americans developed spy satellites, Japan made video cameras and is reaping the revenues.  Research Called Unbalanced **********Just last month, for instance, executives from 11 large computer companies issued a report saying that too much Federal research and development money had been spent on the military and not enough on computers. **********The report said that nearly 70 percent of Federal research and development money goes to the military, up from 50 percent a decade ago. Although the Federal Government spends more over all on research and development than most of the other industrial powers, its nonmilitary research and development spending is less than in the other nations, as measured by percentage of gross national product. **********Military spending was once believed to contribute to the nation's overall technological ability. The fledgling American semiconductor industry got its start developing chips for the Minuteman missile in the 1960's and only later began selling to computer companies. **********That is less likely to be the case now, in part, some people say, because military technology has increasingly emphasized exotic technology with few apparent commercial spinoffs, like semiconductor chips that can resist nuclear radiation.  Shift in Electronics **********In the case of electronics, on which \"smart weapons\" rely, the growing computer and consumer electronics industries have simply spurted ahead of the military as users of chips and as technology leaders. In the 60's, about 70 percent of chips went into military equipment; now only about 8 percent do. So chip companies aim their development efforts at satisfying computer companies, not the Pentagon. **********Similarly, some composite materials used in weapons are \"not nearly as advanced as what you could buy in a sporting goods store,\" said Michael Sekora, a former director of technology planning in the Pentagon. **********Robert B. Costello, chief of Pentagon procurement in the Reagan Administration, said: \"Defense is not a leader. In many cases it's not even a user of the latest technology.\" **********Indeed, an increasing problem for the Pentagon is keeping its obsolete technology in operation. Because it takes 8 to 15 years to develop a weapon, the technology is often outdated by the time the weapon is ready. **********One company, Lansdale Semiconductor of Tempe, Ariz., does nothing but manufacture computer chips for the Pentagon that have long since been discontinued by the original manufacturer. Some of these chips are in the Tomahawk and Patriot systems and in sensors on helicopters used in the gulf war, said Lansdale's president, Dale Lillard.  Advantages of Commercialism **********Unencumbered by the burdensome military procurement regulations, and spurred by competition, makers of commercial products often rush ahead. An example of this is devices that calculate latitude and longitude by receiving signals from the Pentagon's Navstar Global Positioning System satellites. **********The Rockwell International Corporation, under a Pentagon contract, developed a portable receiver that weighs 17 pounds and can be carried in a backpack. But companies fiercely competing to sell receivers for use in pleasure boats offer units that weigh as little as three pounds and can be carried in one hand. **********These units are not quite as rugged as the military versions and lack some features, like protection against jamming. But when the Defense Department found itself needing thousands of receivers in the Saudi desert, it had to turn to a commercial supplier to provide them quickly and cheaply. **********Indeed, the Pentagon is buying more commercial products to save time and money. In a sense, therefore, the spinoffs are now going the other way: A healthy commercial industry is considered necessary for the military.  Foreign Technology Used **********One consequence of this is that the United States, lacking a consumer electronics business and behind in production of certain types of semiconductors, is becoming dependent on Japan and other nations for technology used in weapons. **********Virtually all the optical glass used in reconnaissance satellites comes from Germany. Many gallium arsenide chips, used in radars and satellite receivers, come from Japan. A report released two weeks ago by the General Accounting Office said that five parts of the Abrams tank are made by foreign companies, including the optics in the gunner's sight and an ingredient in a seal. **********The extent of foreign dependency is not known. Several reports suggest that current weapons contain a small percentage of foreign parts but that the next generation will have a larger percentage. Some people say there is no problem in relying on allies for military technology; others believe the best course is to be self-sufficient. Research and Development **********Still, some Pentagon and industry officials have been arguing that the Pentagon should direct some research and development money to help American technology companies compete in commercial markets. Only if American companies are successful in commercial markets will they be able to produce supplies for the military, these people say. **********If there is a lesson from the gulf war, some executives said, it is that the United States can accomplish what it sets its mind and money to do. If the nation determined that economic security was as important as military security, \"we could catch up in the commercial arena as well,\" said William J. Spencer, chief executive of Sematech, a technology consortium in Austin, Tex., that is backed by the Pentagon and industry. **********\"Why can't we make a VCR when we can make a Patriot missile?\" asked Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. His answer: \"We really care about making Patriot missiles.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/27/world/yugoslavia-fails-to-oust-militias.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1991-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YUGOSLAVIA FAILS TO OUST MILITIAS", "print_headline": "YUGOSLAVIA FAILS TO OUST MILITIAS", "body_text": " **********Units of the Yugoslav Army failed on Wednesday to dislodge Slovenian militias that were occupying key border posts to back up the republic's assertion that it was now independent of the Yugoslav federation. **********At the same time, tension rose in the neighboring republic of Croatia, which also declared independence on Tuesday from Yugoslavia, after ethnic Serbs stormed a Croatian police station in the town of Glina, about 50 miles south of Zagreb. A Croatian policeman and two civilians were reportedly killed Wednesday and six people wounded in the gun battle. **********But in general, the national forces and those of the northern republics challenging federal authority circled and maneuvered around each other without actually clashing. **********Reuters reported that the Yugoslav news agency Tanyug said tanks were moving toward Ljubljana, the Slovene capital. Tanyug said a soldier was slightly wounded in a clash with a Slovenian defense unit near Novo Mesto, close to the Slovenian border with Croatia, as a column of army vehicles broke through a barricade of buses and continued toward the airport. **********The Associated Press reported that defiant citizens set up roadblocks but apparently did not try to fight the advance. The significance of the army movement and the degree of resistence that it was met with were not clear, **********\"It's a battle of nerves at this moment, it's not a real war,\" the Slovene Foreign Minister, Dimitrij Rupel, said earlier. **********Shortly after he spoke in Ljubljana, the Slovene capital was buzzed by Yugoslav MIG fighter planes making low-level sweeps that at times drowned out church bells tolling as part of an official celebration of the decision announced on Tuesday to pull away from the rest of Yugoslavia. **********But the federal Government succeeded in shutting down air traffic into and out of Ljubljana at noon on Wednesday by refusing to give aircraft access to air routes. The airport remains closed. **********On Wednesday afternoon, Yugoslav Army tanks and trucks heading up major roads toward border posts seized by the Slovenians were bottled up by Slovenes who stalled heavy trucks and constrution equipment in the path of the military convoy. **********\"When they tell me to let them go, I'll let them go,\" said an officer of a Slovenian police unit blocking a main mountain pass on a road leading to the border crossing to Italy near the town of Nova Gorica. **********A few hundred yards back, a frustrated Army officer said his unit would get through the traffic jam. **********\"We'll wait here as long as we have to,\" he said before adding \"We'll fight our way through if we have to. It's all the same to me.\" Presidency to Meet **********Minutes later, the unit turned around and retreated. **********Despite a sense that the standoff was stiffening, the prospect of a negotiated settlement of the crisis became slightly greater as the Government announced that Yugoslavia's recently inert and immobilized federal executive, which includes representatives of all six republics, would meet early today to discuss the crisis. The announcement of the meeting, carried by Yugoslav radio and television, said the representatives of Croatia and Slovenia would attend, though that could not be confirmed. **********But early today Belgrade television quoted the Slovenian representative to the Presidency, Janez Drnovsek, as saying that neither he not the Croatian representative would attend the meeting, which he called illegal. **********Such meetings have been called before in the last two months only to be canceled at the last minute. **********One report circulating here held that the meeting was being convened by the Council for the Protection of Constitutional Order, a sort of national security group that includes the republican representatives along with the federal Minister of Defense, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic. Securing the Northern Borders **********Within hours of Tuesday's declarations by Slovenia and Croatia, Ante Markovic, the federal Prime Minister, announced that the Cabinet had ordered the army to take control of international borders in the two northernmost republics. **********The military's mandate is apparently to secure Yugoslavia's northern borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary, and to displace regional border guards and customs officials who were put in place as part of Slovenia's declaration of sovereignty. **********But on Wednesday night, state television here in Serbia showed images of Slovene border guards along the Austrian frontier hoisting the republic's white, red and blue banner under newly erected signs that read \"Republic of Slovenia.\" **********Much of the army's movements on Wednesday were focused on regions of Croatia where that republic's declaration of independence from the federal state set off violent clashes between members of the 600,000-member Serbian minority there and the Croatian police forces.  Casualties of Serb-Croat Strife **********Conflicting reports of the numbers of dead and wounded circulated throughout the day, but according to the Croatian Interior Ministry in the capital, Zagreb, at least four people were killed, three of them when ethnic Serbs attacked the Croatian police station in the town of Glina. **********Conflicts between the Serbs, who have vowed to resist Croatian independence, and the Croatian police were reported throughout the day on Wednesday, focusing mainly on Glina and the city of Dvor on the Una River, about 60 miles south of Zagreb. In both places, Yugoslav army units accompanied by tanks held a fragile peace. **********An off-duty federal police officer was reported killed in a shooting incident in the Croatian town of Brsadin. The clashes on Wednesday raised the death total in Serb-Croat violence this year to about 25. **********The Croatian authorities, who on Tuesday announced that they would leave the Yugoslav Union, asserted that the National Army was slow to assist their republican police units in ending Wednesday's siege in Glina. Serbian Threat of Action **********\"We did not win the cooperation of Yugoslav Army units until after a long series of discussions,\" said Milan Brezak, Croatia's Deputy Internal-Affairs Minister, in a news conference Wednesday. **********The clashes were reminiscent of earlier eruptions of violence between Serbs and Croats, the two largest ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. **********In Belgrade, which is the capital of the Serbian republic as well as that of the whole country, the Serbian Parliament debated the events of the last 24 hours in a special session, and the Serb Prime Minister, Dragutin Zelenovic, suggested that Serbia was prepared to take action that he did not fully specify. **********\"Serbia has already taken steps to assure Serbian interests,\" Mr. Zelenovic told the packed assembly. \"And they are going to be implemented when the Government of Serbia decides it is the right moment to do so.\" **********Mr. Zelenovic did not elaborate, but Yugoslavs and Western diplomats said they thought it was likley that Serbia might counter the steps taken by Croatia and Slovenia by declaring the annexation of the heavily Serbian regions in Croatia. **********Under the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974, which is still nominally in force though it has been shredded by all sides in the recent ethnic conflicts, the Defense Minister, though a member of the federal Cabinet, is responsible to the Presidency as commander in chief. But with the Presidency effectively inoperative, Yugoslavs and diplomats said command of the army appeared to have devolved, under an ad hoc arrangement, to Prime Minister Markovic, working in close concert with General Kadijevic."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-grace-rothschild-to-end-sterling-work.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grace & Rothschild To End Sterling Work", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Grace & Rothschild To End Sterling Work", "body_text": " **********For the second time in a week, a United States advertising agency is losing a large account because a foreign auto maker no longer will be selling its cars in this country. **********Grace & Rothschild Advertising, New York, said it would end work later this month on its $20 million Sterling auto account, following a surprise announcement on Friday by British Aerospace P.L.C. that Sterling sales will end here.

The sugar ration of 3.3 pounds a month for each person has been effectively cut to 1.15 pounds a month. Redemptions of tea coupons have slipped from about 4.5 ounces for each person to about 1.8 ounces. **********With Government food supplies severely reduced, more and more Iraqi families are being forced into the open food market, where prices of basic food items are seven times higher than they were at the outset of the crisis, but where shortages of rice, sugar and milk have become more apparent. 'Sanctions Are Working' **********\"Sanctions are working, no matter what anybody says,\" one Asian ambassador said in an interview, noting that basics like eggs and fresh milk have either disappeared or have been priced beyond the reach of most Iraqi families. \"The country has had no income in the last five months, so there has got to be a limit to their endurance,\" he added. **********The strongest indication of a looming food crisis was a Government announcement 10 days ago that all excess supplies of sugar and flour on the open market were to be confiscated by Iraqi authorities administering the rationing program. **********And last week, Government agents actually swept through food stores in Baghdad confiscating the scarce staple foods that were in private hands and for sale at wildly inflated free market prices, according to a number of Iraqi witnesses. **********Of basic food groups, meat has suffered the least price inflation, but still prices have almost doubled. Foreign diplomats said meat prices have been moderated somewhat by an increase in the slaughter in Iraq's sheep herds last fall, but with the end of the slaughter season, prices are expected to move up more rapidly in coming weeks as supplies tighten. Steak Supplies Dwindling **********One luxury hotel in downtown Baghdad is still serving T-bone steaks taken from Kuwait, but these supplies are dwindling rapidly. **********The price of Iraqi Sumer cigarettes, previously produced with local tobacco blended with some American tobacco, has leapt from half an Iraqi dinar to 3.5 dinars, a sevenfold increase. **********The Government mobilization of the agricultural sector to blunt the impact of the embargo has engendered mixed results and has resulted in an overall poor performance, with no improvement in grain production in sight because of the lack of rain in November, the planting month, diplomats said. Iraq imported 90 percent of its basic grain needs before the crisis. **********But a major expansion of vegetable crop planting on irrigated lands has helped supplement declining food supplies, a number of people said, though the manpower pool for the agricultural sector was reduced last month when the Government rescinded farmers' exemption from military service. **********Hundreds of thousands of Egyptian farm laborers also have fled Iraq and are no longer contributing to agricultural production here. Psychological Effect **********\"In many ways they have felt the effect of this embargo,\" one senior envoy said of the Iraqis. \"Psychologically speaking it has worked. Under the rations they are getting less food and they are critical about the rocketing price situation.\" **********The envoy pointed out that the standard of living has been seriously hurt in such important regional cities such as Karbala and Najaf, both important religious centers for the Shiite Muslim sect that is the largest population group in Iraq. **********Even during the early months of the embargo, an Indian philanthropic group set up a food distribution center in those cities and \"they had such long queues they were very surprised,\" the envoy said. **********But for now, this envoy said he could not predict that the embargo would compel Mr. Hussein to pull his forces out of Kuwait by any certain date in the near future. **********If the minimum quality of life \"can be secured by the Government, they can endure,\" the envoy said, adding that this remained an open question. Reserves Being Used **********A Middle Eastern envoy said the growing food problems had forced Iraq to tap strategic food reserves the Government might have been trying to preserve for the long run. Sweet shops and pastry shops, big users of sugar, were allowed to reopen during the Christmas holidays. **********The food crisis has also brought a notable increase in cross-border smuggling from Iraq's neighbors, particularly Iran and Jordan. One diplomat said that in October a check of the highway between Baghdad and the Jordanian border found the artery virtually free of traffic from Jordan. But a check 10 days ago of the same highway found \"tens\" of covered freight carrying trucks with Jordanian license plates streaming toward the Iraqi capital. **********\"This is a new phenomenon,\" a senior Asian envoy said. **********Western embassies said they had received fresh reports of significant truck traffic entering Iraq from Iran at a number of points along the 700-mile frontier between the two nations, which fought a bitter eight-year war. Pressure on Hussein **********Foreign embassies monitoring the embargo's effects say it is too early to tell whether the volume of Government food distribution will continue to deteriorate at the current rate, but most analysts here agree that the food crisis will only add to the political pressure on Mr. Hussein to seek some political resolution to the Kuwait adventure. **********Outside the food sector, lines have developed in the last 10 days at government distribution points for bottled natural gas, which is used widely in Iraqi homes to fuel cooking stoves, hot-water heaters and space heaters. **********The price of the 100-pound metal cannisters of gas has remained stable, but neighborhood distribution trucks have disappeared in many parts of the city, forcing most families to drive to distribution centers, where lines have formed for the first time. **********Western officials said they have heard two explanations for the shortage, which is not yet deemed serious. One explanation is that with the sudden decline of crude oil production, the production of natural gas as a by-product has declined proportionately. **********Second, government plants that process the natural gas and fill the 100-pound metal cylinders for the retail market used sophisticated French-made machinery that may be suffering for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance with the departure of French and other foreign technicians. **********A still uncertain shortage that looms this month is for chlorine compounds used the the national water purification plants. Foreign technicians who departed last month reported that supplies of the chlorine compounds were critically short and would not last beyond Jan. 5 or Jan. 6. **********But some European embassies believe that the Iraqi authorities can make up for the shortfall by smuggling adequate quantities from Jordan or Iran."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/14/business/kodak-in-joint-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak in Joint Venture", "print_headline": "Kodak in Joint Venture", "body_text": " **********The Eastman Kodak Company and Broadcast Television Systems of Darmstadt, Germany, will jointly develop and market a scanning device to transfer motion picture film images to high-definition television.

Instead, you should set up a portfolio that is broadly diversified over several different asset classes -- such as domestic and international bonds, stocks and cash -- and then resist the urge to tinker with it at every announcement of world, or domestic, events. **********Asset allocation is certainly not a new technique. But like most basics, it often gets lost amid the marketing gimmicks. Consider the asset allocation funds that appeared soon after the 1987 stock market crash, when mutual fund companies tried to shift the focus of investors away from the tattered equity market. **********One of the most pretentious of the lot drew money managers from different parts of the world; they met quarterly in a townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side with someone called \"The Allocator,\" a money manager who made the final decision. Not only did this mumbo jumbo result in high expenses, but all that asset shifting made the fund a market timer -- trying to outsmart what is essentially a nonrational phenomenon. Then called the National Strategic Allocation Fund, it is now named the National Global Allocation Fund. **********Many investors are also confused about asset allocation and market timing. The theory behind asset allocation is that individual investors do not have enough information to time the market and they are better off hedging their bets. Although most small investors would agree in principle, they simply can't resist the urge to look for an investment that will double their money. **********\"The desire to find a way to beat the system is so strong that it continually comes back cloaked in other language,\" says Roger C. Gibson, president of Gibson Capital Management Ltd., a money management firm in Pittsburgh. \"Unless you completely extinguish the idea that market timing is not possible, it will just keep creeping out.\" **********Investors who resist the idea of market timing but then make a last-minute emotional decision to pull out of the market because they are worried, say, about war in the Middle East, make an obvious mistake: \"They buy high and sell low, no question about it,\" said Harold Evensky, a financial planner at Evensky & Brown, Miami. **********So forget about hot tips. Think instead about spreading your assets across a variety of asset classes that will perform differently. This will cushion your portfolio against swings in any one sector. The more sectors you cover, the better your cushion. **********Mr. Evensky urges clients to divide assets into two basic categories: income investments, such as bonds, money market funds and Treasury bills, and growth investments, including stocks and even your home, which provide the opportunity for your principal to grow over time. Mr. Evensky breaks down growth investments into sectors that perform well in different environments: *********** Commercial. This includes investments that move with the business cycle like stocks, an investment in your own business, or equipment leasing. *********** Real estate. This moves in a slightly different cycle and does well in inflationary times. Mr. Evensky acknowledges that this is a particularly difficult category, given the current problems in the real estate market. But, he said, \"In theory, it still makes sense.\" *********** Natural resources. This includes oil, gas and timber, which are used by business even if the economy is in the dumps. *********** Precious metals and collectibles. These are a hedge against inflation. **********Assuming you believe that you should diversify and sit tight rather than attempting to time the market, how should you deploy your assets over the various sectors? Mr. Evensky tailors a program for clients based on their risk tolerance, whether their financial needs are longer or shorter term, and a certain \"feel\" he has about what is appropriate for them. Even if you can't afford a financial planner, you can still proceed with the same basic approach. **********Finally, you should readjust your portfolio at regular intervals, say once a year. This is not to be confused with market timing. You stick to your initial allocation, trading only to keep the original balance. \"Whatever has most recently done the best must be sold to get back to target and whatever has done poorly is now underrepresented,\" Mr. Gibson said.FIRST OF ALL, KNOW THYSELF **********William G.

Five Tornados have been lost to Iraqi anti-aircraft fire and one went down in an accident. **********Sir David said today that contrary to news reports, only one Tornado had been lost while dropping JP-233 runway-cratering devices to keep Iraqi fighters from attacking Americans during raids on nuclear power plants, chemical weapons centers and other strategic sites inside Iraq. **********He said that the Tornados were now flying fewer low-level missions but that was because the allies had established air superiority over the Iraqis.

They returned home from Ottawa on Tuesday night. **********Against a backdrop of Quebec separatism, the heir to the British throne endorsed the status of the French-speaking province as a \"distinct\" society within the Canadian Constitution and made a strong plea for national unity. \"The world, in brief, needs Canada,\" he declared. **********Speaking at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, on Monday, the Prince, who will turn 43 on Nov. 14, acknowledged that it was a \"risky business\" for a future king to be venturing into Canada's constitutional business, but observed wryly he had a \"hereditary defect -- living dangerously.\" An Ancestor's Adventure **********He cited his great-great-grandfather, an earlier Prince of Wales, who in 1860 volunteered to ride a tightrope walker's wheelbarrow across Niagara Falls, but was finally talked out of the adventure by Canadian authorities. He became Edward VII in 1901. **********No Canadian authorities sought to talk Prince Charles out of his latest adventure, which could not have been better designed to bolster the position of the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Its latest constitutional proposals also recognize Quebec's distinctiveness as part of arrangements to keep the federation together. Few thought the words, however unusual, would stir any controversy. **********The royal couple were accompanied by their two children, William, 9, and Henry, 7 -- the first time the boys have traveled with their parents on an official tour overseas. Projecting a Homey Picture **********In the face of recurrent rumors of fractures in the marital alliance, the visit was intended to project a homey picture of family values. **********It also provided some on-the-job training in royal do's and dont's for the two boys.

Newspapers reported numbers of onlookers far smaller than those drawn by the Duke and Duchess of York in 1987.

One result,, they say, could be a rapid advance in accuracy and technological sophistication of the developing world's military arsenals. **********Having watched as \"smart\" bombs and cruise missiles dispatched an armed force that Iraq spent $50 billion to amass, third-world nations are already scouting for similar weapons, Bush Administration officials and private experts said in interviews. **********The trend is worrisome, they said, because it suggests some erosion in the military edge that enabled Western nations to win so decisively, without heavy casualties to their own forces, in the Persian Gulf war. Wars Could Be More Destructive **********More important, it raises the prospect that future armed conflicts in the third world could be vastly more destructive as precision weapons that cannot easily be repelled wreak the sort of damage that Iraq's inaccurate Scuds never managed to inflict. **********Major powers like the Soviet Union and China are seeking the same weapons technologies, and some worry that they may supply them to other nations. But the arming of lesser regional powers is most troubling because, as Iraq showed, developing regions are easily destabilized by weapons buildups and are far more likely to erupt into war. **********Though the Bush Administration has stated its opposition to an arms race and is discussing with France and other Western powers an agreement to curb some weapons sales to prevent one, the United States has emerged from the war as the gulf region's premier arms seller. The White House told Congress in a classified report this month that it wanted to allow five Middle East allies to buy an $18 billion package of top-drawer weapons like F-16 jet fighters, Patriot antimissile defenses, multiple-rocket launchers and M-1 tanks. **********Some Persian Gulf nations are already rearming, though several factors work against an immediate and greatly intensified arms race, the analysts said. In the Middle East, war expenses and stagnant oil revenues will force the postponement of some major arms purchases until the mid-1990's, they said. Many experts also believe that Iraq's military devastation will itself dampen any future weapons buildup by eliminating the region's major aggressive power.  Arms Sales to Mideast Nations **********Germany has agreed to sell Israel two top-of-the-line diesel submarines capable of launching both torpedoes and cruise missiles. Strapped for hard currency, the Soviet Union is selling many of its best weapons, like MiG-29 jet fighters, to such nations as Iran and Syria. **********Other buyers outside the gulf, goaded by national pride and suspicion of their neighbors, are equally eager to buy. **********Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, drove home the point in a speech on March 16 in which he said that Iraq's crushing defeat only underscored the need to make his own nation \"an impregnable fortress\" to aggressors. **********\"The military aspect of the gulf war has made the fact clear that to undermine the science, technology, research and modern advances in defense is disastrous,\" he said. \"The challenge of the technology is a permanent phenomenon.\" **********China is believed to be considering the sale of its new M-9 and M-11 medium-range ballistic missiles, which are said to be more accurate and reliable than the Soviet-made Scuds used by Iraq, and already has sold M-series missile technology to other nations, the Pentagon said this month. China is just one of several developing nations with active ballistic missile programs. Soviet Arms' Reputation Is Hurt **********Just as ominous to some is a growing demand for adaptations of the state-of-the-art technologies used in such military hardware as cruise missiles, reconnaissance satellites and radar-invisible Stealth fighters. **********In a report this month, the director of naval intelligence, Adm. Thomas A. Brooks, said that at least 40 countries were seeking \"low observable\" weapons technologies like materials that absorb radar waves, and that France, Sweden and other Western nations were incorporating them in their own arms. By 2000, the report forecast, nine nations will join the six that now deploy reconnaissance satellites, a technology that gave the West a decisive advantage in the Iraq conflict. **********The report predicted a trend among developing nations toward \"increasingly sophisticated military hardware, especially in naval and air forces,\" regardless of the cost. **********While most of these additions were contemplated well before the gulf war, experts say the war has lent a new gleam to Western weapons and wounded the reputation of hardware made by Iraq's supplier, the Soviet Union. More than that, the lopsided allied victory demonstrated that even an overwhelming force of the relatively capable tanks, jets and air-defense weapons common to the third world are ineffective against advanced weapons and computerized communications and intelligence systems. **********\"Look at what our Apache helicopters did to their tanks with Hellfire missiles,\" said Richard Grimmett, an expert on third-world arms with the Congressional Research Service. \"It's the old argument that the Israelis have always used: a qualitative advantage compensates for a quantitative disadvantage.\" Beyond Their Pocketbooks **********Government officials and private experts say that many advanced Western technologies, like the electronics and exotic materials used in the F-117 Stealth fighter, probably will not be offered on the world weapons market for decades and are beyond the pocketbooks of most developing powers anyway. On the other hand, they say, less advanced versions of those weapons, as well as simpler technologies that developing nations are beginning to master, still can play havoc not only with an enemy's military but also with a superpower's forces as well. **********In the ocean, nautical mines and submarines are a growing concern to Pentagon officials, who said that Persian Gulf naval forces were preoccupied this winter by the military potential of Iran's single, difficult-to-locate mini-submarine. Mini-subs are sold worldwide by an Italian company recently acquired by a Chilean arms merchant, Carlos Cardoen. **********Some experts believe that third-world arms makers will be able to produce rudimentary cruise missiles, somewhat bigger than those that rocked Baghdad, but far cheaper and nearly as accurate. The ground-hugging missiles themselves are reasonably simple to build, but an accurate guidance system that directs them to their targets is only now within their expertise, said W. Seth Carus, an arms expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. **********\"A whole range of cruise missiles clearly are within the competence of large numbers of countries,\" Mr. Carus said in an interview. \"Places like India, Israel, China and even the Iraqis were starting to get into that business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/27/business/latvia-moves-to-open-an-air-route-window-on-the-west.html": {"writer_name": "David Rohde", "pub_date": "1991-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Latvia Moves to Open an Air-Route Window on the West", "print_headline": "Latvia Moves to Open an Air-Route Window on the West", "body_text": " **********In the two months since Latvia gained independence from the Soviet Union, Western airlines and investors have become keenly interested in the rights to fly to this Baltic capital at the center of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. **********The Latvians also have ambitious plans to form their own national airline as a joint venture with a foreign investor. But Latvia's concerns about how much control foreign investors might have and problems with a small, crumbling main passenger terminal threaten to stall plans to turn Riga into an air hub for the Baltics and the Soviet Union. **********So far, Lufthansa, Swiss Air, El Al, Austrian Airlines, Hamburg Airlines, and even Malev Air, the Hungarian national airline, have all expressed interest in joining Scandinavian Airline System and the new United States-based Baltia Airlines in obtaining landing rights in Riga, according to the Transport Ministry. **********\"We are looking forward to the opening of these airlines and are very interested in cooperation with the West,\" said Janis Janovskis, Latvia's Minister of Transport. **********The nucleus of the Latvia's new national airline would be the planes, staff and routes that make up the Latvian division of Aeroflot, soon to be turned over to Latvia by the Soviet Government. But the venture would also need Western investors' money, about $25 million of it. **********A group of Houston-based investors say they have nearly completed negotions begun with the Latvian Government last spring to form the new national airline, to be known as Baltic International Airlines, though interviews here make it seem less than certain that the Texans will succeed. **********According to Homi Davier, the head of the Houston group, and Girts Lejins, his lawyer in Riga, Baltic International would use Riga as its hub, to serve mainly European passengers bound for various parts of the Soviet Union. For a $25 million investment over five years, the Americans would receive a 45 percent interest in the new airline and Mr. Davier would become its president. **********The new airline would receive from the Latvian division of Aeroflot up to 30 medium-size Soviet passenger jets, 400 pilots and the rights to fly to 76 cities in the Soviet Union. Thirty percent of ticket sales would be made in rubles or in the new Latvian currency, once it is introduced, so tickets would remain affordable for Latvians. **********There are also plans for a joint venture between Riga's airport and the Americans to refurbish and expand the airport. **********But several Latvian officials expressed reservations about signing the final agreement with the Houston investors. Ojars Blumbergs, chairman of the Latvian Parliament's Committee on Energy, Transport and Communications, said a foreign partner for the new airline should be chosen by bid. **********Austris Zobens, the newly appointed Latvian director of the national airline, emphasized in an interview that a final agreement had not been signed with the American investors. He said that Latvia has a pressing need for financial and technical assistance, but expressed a hope that it would come in part from Western governments. **********\"The decision is up to the Latvian Government. I believe we have many opportunities and we must choose the best partner,\" Mr. Zobens said. \"Only one thing can be said firmly. It will be difficult for us to have a good company without Western help.\" **********Mr. Zobens also said, and other Latvian officials confirmed, that other investors have expressed an interest in forming a joint venture with the national airline. **********Several Latvian Aeroflot employees wondered whether Latvians were being slighted in the proposed joint venture. One employee, who declined to give her name, said of the Americans, \"They're just trying to get the best deal. Why should the president of the Latvian national airline be American? Is it fair?\" **********Even with an investor in place, the airline will have to overcome significant obstacles. Mr. Blumbergs acknowledged that most of the airport facilities the airline would use and the Aeroflot jets themselves are largely outmoded. **********And Mr. Zobens, who would be a vice president in the airline and its senior Latvian executive, said that he lacks experience running an airline. He spent 15 years as an Aeroflot pilot and two years as the head of a small civilian airport on the outskirts of Riga before assuming his current post. **********Still, the Latvians sense they are sitting atop a potentially lucrative capitalistic enterprise. Mr. Blumbergs said that the airline's routes to 76 cities in the Soviet Union would increase in value as more Westerners travel and do business in the Soviet Union. **********\"There will be a lot of confusion in the Russian economy in the next few years,\" he predicted. \"It's important that Latvian Aeroflot take advantage of these routes and exploit the opportunity that the poor quality of Aeroflot's other divisions presents us with.\" **********But exploiting such opportunities will also require a modern, competitive airport in Riga. While the city is ideally situated, a tour of what will soon become Riga International Airport revealed the enormous task the Latvians and a Western partner face. **********The airport now handles a million passengers a year and has 20 daily domestic flights and 5 international flights each week. SAS, the only foreign airline, has two flights a week to Copenhagen. **********\"The airport was built in 1974 as a domestic airport and little maintenance has been done on it since then, except for the addition of the control tower,\" said Vilnas Azas, the airport's new director. **********His most immediate problem is the terminal's leaky roof. \"In most international airports you have leaks, but not in all parts of the roof all day. It must be completely replaced,\" he said. **********The main terminal has few gates, which seem destined to invite long, Soviet-style lines. Serving possibly eight foreign airlines with a single international gate would require tricky scheduling. With only two baggage claim areas, two working fuel trucks, no hangars for passenger jets, and one customs area for passengers entering and leaving Latvia, drastic changes would have to be made to accommodate more Western airlines, Mr. Azas said. **********Riga International will also have to cope with the attitudes of 300 airport employees. \"Our employees must learn to smile and keep smiling all day,\" Mr. Azas said. \"I see a big problem in changing our staff's mentality and pushing them up to a Western service level.\" **********Mr. Azas, a 37-year-old former Aeroflot navigator, said he had seen only three Western airports: JFK in New York, Montreal and Stockholm. **********\"I am not afraid of my lack of knowledge of this kind of business,\" he said. \"I realize that there is a huge task in front of me, but I want to complete it. I want to make this airport good enough to be one of the best in Europe,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/business/new-impetus-in-honda-car-building-effort.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1991-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Impetus in Honda Car-Building Effort", "print_headline": "New Impetus in Honda Car-Building Effort", "body_text": " **********The Honda Motor Company, responding to \"a number of socio-economic changes\" that have complicated business, including the new Clean Air Act in the United States, announced today that it was intensifying efforts to develop vehicles that will set new environmental, energy and safety standards. **********Honda provided few details, except to say it was working on a highly energy-efficient compact model that would be introduced \"in the near future.\" The auto maker will also begin public testing of what it says is the world's first electric motorcycle this year in Japan. **********Honda also announced it would create in Southeast Asia a fourth area for \"self-reliant\" automotive marketing and production, in addition to its centers in Japan, Europe and the United States. **********What a spokesman characterized as Honda's \"new direction\" was outlined in a New Year's address and policy statement, delivered in Tokyo by Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who took over in June as Honda's president and chief executive. **********Although Honda is one of Japan's smaller auto makers, it has produced some of the industry's most important engine technology, and therefore is closely watched by competitors.

The announcement appears to be a largely political gesture intended to defuse a new and increasingly contentious high-technology trade dispute. **********Sharp is the leading producer of the ultra-thin video screens, which are used in laptop and notebook computers. Its decision -- which is likely to be followed by other Japanese screen manufacturers -- comes less than a week after the Commerce Department accused those manufacturers of selling their products below fair market value.   Following Car Makers' Lead **********With its decision, Sharp appears to be following a strategy that has worked brilliantly for Japan's auto makers: to produce a good portion of their product in the United States, with American workers, making it far more difficult for Congress to take punitive or protective measures. Sharp said that in 1993 it plans to produce a half-million screens a year at the United States plant, or roughly a third of its projected market for this country. **********The announcement marks the first time that any Japanese maker has moved production of the screens to the United States. There is a smattering of American flat-panel producers, but they are widely considered to be well behind their Japanese competitors and far too small to make the kind of investments needed to produce the screens in volume. **********In the coming decade, virtually all computers -- and many types of television sets as well -- are expected to display their information on the sleek, thin panels, experts say, making it increasingly important for the United States that some production technology reside there. **********At a news conference here today, Sharp officials said that at least for the first few years, the $30 million, 250-employee plant they are building in Camas, Wash., near Portland, Ore., would perform \"final assembly\" operations. That means that the most difficult technology involved in manufacturing flat-panel displays -- producing the 10-inch computer screens from silicon, without a single flaw -- would remain in Japan. In the United States, the company will add peripheral electronics and the frame used to mount the screens in various types of computers. **********Sharp will produce only its simplest screens in the United States. The most expensive, sophisticated screens, involving color displays that use a new technology called \"active matrix,\" will remain in Japan. **********Sharp officials denied that they were moving only a minimum amount of production and technology to the United States in hopes of preventing Congressional action against the Japanese producers. No Economic Reason Seen **********\"If you include U.S.-made parts, half the value added of these screens will be in the United States,\" said Toshio Toda, the deputy general manager of Sharp's liquid crystal display group. **********But industry officials said there was no economic advantage for Sharp in producing the screens outside Japan. Because the screens are small and light, and require little direct labor, shipping them around the globe is relatively easy. **********\"It is a familiar pattern,\" said John Stern, who heads a trade group office for American electronics makers in Tokyo. \"After there are allegations of dumping, production begins to move to America.\" The term \"dumping\" refers to the practice of selling screens below the cost of producing and marketing them. **********Whether the Japanese are dumping has turned into a divisive issue for American industry. The small American companies working on flat-panel technology, which filed the initial complaints in Washington against Japanese competitors, said that unless the United States took action the domestic industry would slowly die. **********But the biggest computer makers in the United States, including the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., pointed out that domestic screen makers do not make the kinds of screens needed for the next generation of portable computers. It would be ridiculous, they said, to force the Japanese to raise prices, and thus increase costs to American computer makers.  The Japanese 'Are Ahead' **********\"The Japanese are clearly ahead in flat-panel displays,\" John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple, said here last week. \"What is happening in America is really small-scale stuff compared to what is happening in Japan, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\" **********Mr. Sculley and his fellow producers seemed to score a modest victory when the Commerce Department issued its preliminary ruling last week. The department concluded that the price differences, or \"dumping margins,\" on which any import tariffs are calculated were relatively small. **********Nonetheless, the ruling seemed to galvanize the Japanese makers. Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Sony and others are all investing heavily in flat-panel technology, concluding that it is a critical link in the food chain of high-technology parts that are common to a huge range of electronic goods. But tariffs and a growing American unease that the technology, which originated in the United States, was being hoarded in Japan could create a morass of political problems. **********Last year a Sharp executive said that his company would move production to the United States \"when it becomes a necessity politically.\" But that moment has apparently not arrived for other companies. The Toshiba Corporation, which has a joint venture in the technology with I.B.M., is building new operations in Japan.

Cephas was confirmed by the State Senate late last week as New York's Superintendent of Banks. He will replace Jill M. Considine, who resigned earlier this year to take a job at the American Express Company. **********Mr. Cephas, 39, a partner who specializes in banking law at Breed, Abbott & Morgan, was general counsel at the Banking Department for two years in the mid-1980's. **********As an appointee of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Cephas is understandably mindful of the banking industry's importance to New York's economy and is wary of ceding the State Banking Department's powers to Federal regulators. \"I understand the impetus for more centralized regulation, but there is validity to arguments that we should recognize the strongly local interest in banking,\" he said. **********\"A lot of innovations have come out of the states,\" he added, including NOW accounts, one of the earliest forms of interest-bearing checking accounts, and rules specifying the maximum length of time a bank may withhold availability of money deposited by check. **********The New York Banking Department is pre-eminent among state regulators. It is responsible for supervising many of the New York-based subsidiaries and branches of the world's largest foreign banks, as well as large state-chartered American banks like Morgan Guaranty Trust, Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. At the more purely local level, it also regulates smaller banks, savings institutions and credit unions that have state charters, as well as mortgage lenders and check-cashing businesses. **********Mr. Cephas said he favored large banks entering new businesses, opening branches and combining with other banks across state lines. He opposes a Treasury Department proposal that foreign banks be required to operate their branches as separately capitalized banks, because it would become too difficult for them to do business in the United States, resulting in job losses for New York and inviting retaliation against large American banks in foreign markets. **********As for allowing commercial companies to own banks, another goal of some large New York City banks, Mr. Cephas said that he was reserving judgment pending more thought about the issue. **********Mr. Cephas and his wife, Donna, live in Manhattan and have a house in the northeastern part of Long Island, where he maintains a flower garden. \"I'm not serious enough about it to make a new career, but I like to jazz up my yard, and add a few new perennials each year,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/world/war-in-the-gulf-un-resolutions-iraq-s-shift-in-position-not-enough-for-the-us.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1991-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: U.N.

The United States views this condition as a major sticking point for an accord. **********On Feb. 16, an Iraqi statement spoke for the first time of Baghdad's \"readiness to deal with Security Council Resolution No. 660 of 1990, with the aim of reaching an honorable and acceptable political solution, including withdrawal.\" **********But the statement did not mention Kuwait, and it carried a long list of conditions, including demands that the allies halt the war and withdraw all forces from the region; that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories; that the Security Council repeal all sanctions; that the future Government of Kuwait be based on the \"people's will,\" and that Iraq receive war reparations and be forgiven its debts.  A Moscow-Baghdad Shuttle **********In the next few days, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq shuttled between Baghdad and Moscow, and on Thursday, the Soviets announced that the Iraqis had agreed to a seven-point plan that included accepting the terms of Resolution 660 unconditionally. **********Under that Soviet proposal, Iraq asked for an end to United Nations economic sanctions after it had withdrawn two-thirds of its forces from Kuwait. Iraq further asked that all United Nations resolutions, including Resolution 674, which demands war reparations, and Resolution 661, calling for the restoration of the Kuwaiti Government, be rescinded after the pullout. It was the first Iraqi offer that omitted mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********The next day, the Soviets announced a plan under which Iraq shifted slightly in its call for an end to sanctions, saying they should cease after Iraq's full withdrawal from Kuwait. **********As the noon deadline for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait passed today, President Saddam Hussein and the Soviet Union have shifted their views on how the crisis should be resolved, but not enough to satisfy the United States and its allies. The Main Sticking Points **********In the allied view, there are two main difficulties with the Soviet Union's latest plan, the six-point blueprint for an Iraqi pullout that Mr. Aziz accepted in Moscow on Friday. **********The first is that it provides 21 days for Iraq to complete its pullout. When President Bush set the deadline of noon today for the pullout to begin, he gave Iraq one week to complete it. **********The second difficulty was the call for the lapsing of the resolutions. **********\"The Soviet proposals fall short of what we need because of the time deadline and the conditionality, which includes nullification of all Security Council resolutions,\" the American representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said today. **********More important, the Soviet plan effectively proposed that all international punishment of Iraq cease after the withdrawal. That would prevent the allies from pursuing their aim of maintaining the United nations military embargo against Iraq to wear down its army and perhaps eventually force it to accept some form of regional security pact that would place permanent limits on its armaments.  Trying to Destroy an Army **********Although the allies' primary goal is the restoration of Kuwait's Government, the Security Council has adopted a broader and vaguer aim defined as \"the restoration of international peace and security in the region.\" The allies cite that goal to justify destroying Iraq's army. **********Lifting all Security Council resolutions would also prevent the allies from holding Iraq responsible for the damage its invasion caused. **********Finally, Iraq would not have explicitly agreed to recognize the Kuwaiti monarchy as a legitimate Government, allowing it to maintain its claim to Kuwait as its 19th province. Diplomats fear this might allow Iraq to give up southern Kuwait while holding onto a northern section including the disputed Rumaila oilfields, now administered as part of Basra province, as well as Warba and Bubiyan islands."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/19/world/soviet-disarray-us-says-4-soviet-republics-vow-to-carry-out-nuclear-arms-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says 4 Soviet Republics Vow To Carry Out Nuclear-Arms Cuts", "print_headline": "SOVIET DISARRAY; U.S. Says 4 Soviet Republics Vow To Carry Out Nuclear-Arms Cuts", "body_text": " **********The leaders of all four of the crumbling Soviet Union's republics that have long-range nuclear missiles have promised to carry out all cuts in nuclear weapons required of them under agreements made between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush, American officials said today. The republics will also accept American advisers to help them dismantle the warheads, the officials said. **********In the last two days, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has visited all four Soviet republics where intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at the United States are based: Russia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and Ukraine. These four states, which have all declared their independence, also make up the core of the new commonwealth that is being formed to replace the Soviet Union. **********American officials said leaders of all four republics had now welcomed Mr. Baker's offer to send teams of American nuclear experts in January. The experts will help begin the process of identifying, collecting, storing and ultimately disabling the nuclear weapons that the Soviet Union is required to eliminate under the recently signed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, and under the unilateral cuts that President Bush and President Gorbachev announced in September. **********It is still not clear whether the republics will deliver on the cuts if political disintegration continues, and it is equally unclear at this time who exactly has his finger on the nuclear trigger. **********The last two republics to pledge to honor the agreements on nuclear weapons were Byelorussia and Ukraine, where Mr. Baker visited today, after flying in from Kazakhstan. Leaders of both of these Slavic republics said they wanted to move speedily beyond the nuclear reduction agreements signed by Mr. Gorbachev and become instead, with American help, totally nonnuclear states.  Ukraine Might Move Faster **********With smiles and nods, Ukrainian and Soviet officials today expressed agreement in principle on the first steps for the removal of the estimated 4,000 nuclear arms stationed in the republic.  [ Page A14. ] **********The Ukraine said it was even prepared to destroy its nuclear weapons more quickly than the seven-year period enjoined by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. **********\"We have presented the United States with a request that U.S. experts come to Ukraine to help solve our problems concerning the destruction of nuclear weapons,\" Ukraine's President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, said in a news conference with Mr. Baker. **********\"We support all those agreements that were struck earlier and we want Ukraine to be a good model of how fast and expeditiously these nuclear weapons can be destroyed,\" he said. \"Our long-cherished dream is to have absolutely no missile silos by the year 2000, but if we succeed in achieving that in five years' time, we will be very happy people.\" **********Both Byelorussia and Ukraine said they would be prepared to become nuclear-free zones -- even if their powerful neighbor, Russia, retained some nuclear missiles, as it currently plans. This was in contrast to Kazakhstan, which said Tuesday that it would retain some nuclear weapons as long as Russia did, even though the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, declared his desire to see all republics except Russia eventually eliminate their nuclear arms. Kravchuk Stands Firm **********In yet another sign that the new commonwealth that is to be formed to succeed the Soviet Union has still not agreed on certain basic security principles, President Kravchuk reiterated to Mr. Baker today that while he is ready to put his nuclear arms under a single commonwealth control until they are destroyed, he will insist on becoming commander in chief of all conventional armed forces on Ukrainian soil. **********\"We stand for the united control and command over strategic nuclear weapons,\" Mr. Kravchuk said, \"but as far as the national armed forces of Ukraine are concerned, I have really proclaimed myself the chief commander.\" **********This, too, contradicts President Yeltsin's plan presented to Mr. Baker on Monday for the commonwealth to have a defense council, made up of member states and headed by the Defense Minister of the Soviet Union, Gen. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, to oversee all strategic and conventional armed forces of the member states. Key Meeting on Saturday **********The eight republics that have committed to forming the commonwealth will gather in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, on Saturday to try to iron out their differences. It is too early to tell how much of what is being declared now is posturing before their meeting, and how much of it involves irreconcilable differences that could bedevil the commonwealth for years. **********Mr. Baker has made adherence by the individual republics to the arms control treaty obligations agreed to by President Gorbachev and President Bush conditions for any American recognition of their independence and foreconomic assistance. **********American nuclear experts will probably be working individually with each republic -- as well as with the central defense council that the new commonwealth is planning to establish -- to help with the dismantling of nuclear weapons. American officials said most of the republic leaders did not have a precise knowledge of the number and type of nuclear missiles they had on their soil, since this was something that was always controlled by the Defense Ministry in Moscow. **********While American officials had no reason to believe that the individual republics would not carry out their respective obligations under arms control agreements forged by President Gorbachev with Washington, it was nevertheless important for Mr. Baker to get their individual assent now that each of these republics has effectively become an independent sovereign state. While American officials wish the republics well in their efforts to become democratic, free-market entities, it is the fate of their nuclear weapons that is the prime concern of the United States at this time. **********The Bush Administration initially opposed the move by Congress two weeks ago to appropriate $400 million to help the Soviets destroy their missiles, but now Mr. Baker is eagerly committing those funds to the republics. **********Some of the republics already have storage sites for their nuclear warheads, but others do not. Some have the ability to transport missiles, others do not. Some have the technical knowledge and the economic resources required to dismantle nuclear warheads and remove the fissionable material, but others do not. **********Under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to reduce their arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles and heavy bombers by roughly one-third. In the case of the Soviet Union, those cuts would be divided among the four republics with long-range missiles. Since that treaty was signed in July, however, President Bush and President Gorbachev agreed in September to additional unilateral cuts. Both countries agreed to destroy or withdraw from service all of their short-range tactical nuclear weapons, on both land and sea. Deeper Cuts Possible **********While Russia and Kazakhstan are insisting on retaining a certain number of nuclear weapons -- even after the agreed cuts with the United States -- they have signaled Mr. Baker that they are open to discussing even deeper reductions than approved by President Gorbachev. Byelorussia and Ukraine were the two republics most affected by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident and the antinuclear movement is very strong in both. **********Moreover, President Kravchuk, who is anxious to meet all of the American military, political and economic conditions for formal recognition by Washington of Ukraine, clearly wanted to give Mr. Baker everything he wanted to hear in their meeting today. Judging from what Mr. Baker said afterward, he appears to have succeeded, and formal American recognition of Ukraine is expected shortly. Said Mr. Baker: \"We are very satisfied with what we heard here this evening concerning the commitment of Ukraine to democracy, free markets and nuclear safety.\" **********Byelorussia, which also sought American recognition from Mr. Baker today, was equally forthcoming. **********\"Byelorussia is going to be a nuclear-free zone and a neutral state,\" said Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Byelorussian Supreme Soviet, in Minsk earlier in the day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/29/world/bush-s-asian-trip-recast-to-stress-jobs-and-exports.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1991-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1596, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSH'S ASIAN TRIP RECAST TO STRESS JOBS AND EXPORTS", "print_headline": "BUSH'S ASIAN TRIP RECAST TO STRESS JOBS AND EXPORTS", "body_text": " **********As President Bush departs Monday for Australia and Asia, the trip he had originally scheduled as a good-will tour has changed under political pressures into a blunt sales pitch for American exports and jobs, bringing anger and dismay in Japan. **********Mr. Bush's decision to take with him a group of American business executives to help insist on freer access to Asian markets is born in part of domestic concerns. Those concerns, his advisers say, include the fear that his decision to travel 26,000 miles overseas amid what some are calling the longest recession since the 1930's will only add fuel to Democrats' criticism that the President prefers tackling problems abroad rather than those in his back yard. **********But the announcement that Mr. Bush would take the business executives with him has brought some strenuous negative reactions from business and political leaders in Japan, aggravating tensions between the two economic superpowers as the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, is seeing his domestic political problems grow.  Actions by Tokyo **********Japanese and American officials are likely to seek to avoid open confrontation during the Japan segment of the trip. And the Japanese, who enjoy a $41 billion trade surplus with the United States, appear to be reacting in small ways already to the Administration's pressure. **********Officials in Tokyo said Friday that they might agree to reduce their auto exports to the United States next year, a move that seems to nod to the American concerns on Japan's auto imports but would probably have little effect because sales already are declining. **********With the economy wounded and his political rivals scenting the blood, Mr. Bush is taking in tow 21 executives of major American corporations, including the heads of Detroit's Big Three automakers, for the 12-day lobbying tour of Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Japanese Criticisms **********The stop in Tokyo from Jan. 7-10 is the last and by far the most important stop of the trip. There, Mr. Bush is scheduled to present his delegation to Mr. Miyazawa and local business leaders in what some Japanese newspapers already are calling an exercise in \"Japan bashing\" at the highest level of the American Government. **********Mr. Bush's advisers insist that the display of American unhappiness is justified by Japan's steadfast refusal to open its markets to American goods, and that their aim is not to embarrass their hosts. **********\"I don't think it's going to be done in a high-handed manner,\" one of the President's political advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in an interview this week. \"We're not going to castigate Japan.\" **********That adviser nonetheless said that the visit entails \"some risk\" of generating a diplomatic backlash in Japan, where opinion polls suggest that the United States increasingly is seen as a declining economic power demanding handouts from its more robust Japanese competitors. **********In Tokyo, the mere anticipation of Mr. Bush's tough-talking mission and his corporate delegation has generated a backwash of angry editorials in major newspapers, and even experts who applaud the idea say it might provoke diplomatic and public-relations problems. In a typical comment, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's leading newspaper, said Mr. Bush appeared to be waging \"gunboat diplomacy in economic areas.\" **********On the American side, some public statements have been equally tough. Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, told reporters outside the White House this month that Japanese trade policies are \"basically unfair\" and deny American manufacturers \"a fair shake.\" **********Joseph T. Gorman, chairman of TRW Inc. and one of the executives making the trip, said in an interview last week that business leaders plan to deliver an unvarnished message to Tokyo. **********\"They have to realize that the problem of trade barriers is inescapable, and it's one that's unsustainable, and something has to be done,\" he said. \"That's the point.\" **********Mr. Bush's Democratic critics have heightened the political stakes, with a group led by the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, threatening legislation that would limit Japanese automobile imports unless the President returned from Tokyo with real trade concession in hand. **********Mr. Bush, in turn, has sought tolower expectations, waying this week only that he would make clear that \"They had better do something\" about unfair trade practices. **********One senior official, citing White House polling data, said that the public believed the nation's economic problems required long-term solutions, and that Mr. Bush agreed. **********When the journey was first scheduled for late November, it was depicted as a personal visit to two of Mr. Bush's favorite world leaders in Japan and Australia, leavened with a new diplomatic initiative on free trade. But Mr. Bush abruptly canceled the trip on Nov. 5, election night, after returns underscored voters' unhappiness with the economy and the Administration's handling of domestic matters in general. 'Jobs, Jobs, Jobs' **********Since then, Prime Minister Robert Hawke of Australia and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan have been ousted from office, the last vestiges of Soviet military power in Asia have vanished, Mr. Bush's popularity has plummeted and a new team of political and policy advisers has taken command in the White House. And while the thrust of the Asia visit remains the same, its political complexion is considerably changed. **********Mr. Bush has billed the trip as a crusade to create and save \"jobs, jobs, jobs\" at home by persuading allies to lower trade barriers and buy more American goods. In a news conference this week, he went as far as to suggest that his hopscotch through two continents and two archipelagos was entirely a domestic matter, devoted solely to promoting exports, \"working out the final phases of a highly complex Federal budget,\" and \"putting the final touches on a State of the Union\" address that will offer new economic meassures. **********In Japan, where he once planned to visit a model high school in Tokyo and play tennis with Emperor Akihito, Mr. Bush now is scheduled to visit an American Toys 'R' Us outlet and invite 18 executives from his business delegation to press Japan's top business and government leaders for trade concessions. **********The shift in emphasis was endorsed by Mr. Bush's new chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and his chief campaign advisers, Fred Malek and Robert Teeter, officials said.  Assertions of Pandering **********A second senior Administration official said that the Asian trip had been intended from its origin to underscore the desire for freer trade in the Pacific, but that the political pressures generated by a sagging economy have now cast it in a sharper and less forgiving light. **********\"Admittedly, it looks more politically expedient than I wanted,\" said that official, who insisted on not being identified. **********Some outside experts are accusing Mr. Bush of pandering to domestic politic pressures. **********\"It's a hell of a way to pursue domestic policy, by sending the President 26,000 miles,\" said Seth Cropsey, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington research institute, at a recent briefing on the Asia trip for reporters. \"We suspect that both he and Barbara will qualify for a free trip to New Hampshire with these miles he's been getting on that.\" **********But the President's aides insist that the four-nation tour is good politics and good diplomacy. **********\"This isn't just a trip to spread diplomatic niceties around to our allies,\" said one of his advisers. \"It's a trip to deal with some of their unfair trade practices and to protect American jobs. If you consider political benefits to be job creation and a better trade balance, then this is a political trip.\" Bush Government's Help **********The trip also will yield more subtle political benefits for Mr. Bush by allowing his principal campaign fund-raiser, the departing Commerce Secretary, Robert A. Mosbacher, to wield White House clout on behalf of American business interests. **********\"Mosbacher wants to signal everybody in the Administration and all the business leaders he's going to have to touch next year that we've got a new relationship -- that business is going to get tangible help from the Government in selling its goods,\" said a former senior trade official in the Bush Administration, who insisted on not being identified. \"And the most tangible evidence of that is this business delegation.\" **********In a telephone interview today, Mr. Mosbacher called Japanese criticism of Mr. Bush's trip \"part of their normal posturing\" and said that Tokyo seldom makes concessions in its trade practices until outside pressures force them to do so. **********In taking business executives with him to Asia, he said, Mr. Bush is merely taking his cue from Asian political leaders, who routinely travel abroad with corporate officials. The coming trip allows business and the White House \"to speak with one voice\" to Tokyo, he said. **********\"The Japanese are much too smart and sophisticated to overreact\" to that, he said. \"We're their No. 1 customer,\" he continued. \"And they know that the President has a very positive attitude toward Japan in general.\" **********The delegation of corporate executives -- the first ever to accompany a President on a state visit -- is potentially the most productive and most risky facet of the entire tour, Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge. It includes officials of some firms that have penetrated the Asian market, some that are showcases of American manufacturing quality, and some that have failed to make a dent in Japan and the rest of Asia and are openly angry about it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-a-kemper-blanket.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Kemper Blanket", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; A Kemper Blanket", "body_text": " **********To emphasize that it makes its customers \"feel good,\" the Kemper Corporation, the financial-services and business company, has covered the outside of a four-page insert with a soft material that feels like a blanket, its symbol.

But after Honda's introduction of its Accord station wagon, that pedestal is not quite so high. **********Nearly a year after Honda showed off its first Accord wagons at its Marysville, Ohio, assembly plant, American sales are running at about 2,000 cars a month, well short of the 3,000 cars Honda had hoped for. **********True, a recession in the United States has severely hurt car sales and promises to give Detroit its worst financial beating ever. And true, the station wagon market has been shrinking, badly hurt by the growing popularity of mini-vans. **********But Honda's wagon is also off to a slow start because of its lofty price, its comparatively modest amount of space and a missing feature or two.  Problems of Price and Space **********Honda, for its part, says it is not disappointed with station wagon sales. They will improve, company executives insist, as the model becomes better known and the economy improves. In any event, they say, the plant where the car is built is operating at close to full capacity, partly because Honda is exporting the station wagon to Europe and Japan. **********Honda's first mistake, several Honda dealers said, was in pricing the compact wagon considerably higher than the Honda Accord sedan -- initially more than $2,000 higher. Shoppers quickly noted that the wagon was not all that much bigger than the sedan and concluded that it was not worth the added cost. **********Given what Honda initially wanted for its wagon, ranging from $17,300 to $19,800, many buyers chose roomier competitors like the Subaru Legacy or the Volvo 240 wagon, which costs only slightly more than a fully-equipped Honda wagon. Others just chose the Accord sedan. **********\"In the climate we're in, purchase price is a major factor,\" said Larry Brueshaber, a Honda dealer in Cincinnati. **********Because Honda's wagon is generally less roomy than many other wagons, as well as comparably priced mini-vans and utility vehicles, it is also less useful. With 64.6 cubic feet of cargo room with the second seat folded down, the Accord compares poorly with the midsized Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable wagons (81.1 cubic feet), and import wagons like the Subaru Legacy (71 cubic feet) or the Volvo 240 (76 cubic feet). **********\"Honda may have overestimated the potential for a sporty-type wagon without that much space in the back,\" said Craig Scott, who owns Scott Honda in West Chester, Pa. \"And I think Honda has to address the fact that a station wagon is perceived to hold more than four people.\" **********Although a third adult could squeeze into the back seat, enabling the car to carry five adults, Honda engineers lacked room for a foldaway third seat in the rear similar to the third-seat option offered by Ford on its Taurus and Sable wagons and on the Chevrolet Caprice, Volvo and others. Honda executives have said they are considering adding a third seat, but not until the car is redesigned in 1995 or 1996.  Swayed by a Radio Ad **********Debbie Luciano of Lincroft, N.J., had been planning to buy a 1992 Honda station wagon, and she even put $2,000 on one. Then she heard a radio advertisement that compared its size with that of a Volvo. \"I started thinking about these high school kids I drive around,\" she said. \"They are big.\" **********After comparing the $20,020 price for the well-equipped Honda with the $21,500 cost of the Volvo, she and her husband decided that the extra space was worth the extra money. **********With the 1991 introductory price of $17,300, the basic Accord wagon cost $2,205 more than a comparably equipped Accord sedan. The most expensive wagon had a $19,800 price tag, $2,255 more than the most luxurious Accord sedan. By contrast, prices for a Ford Taurus station wagon start at less than $15,000. **********Honda has since made some pricing changes. For the 1992 model year, it narrowed the price difference between the wagon and the sedan, not by cutting prices but by raising the price of the sedan more than the wagon. Now, the least expensive Honda wagon costs $17,450, compared with $15,825 for the least-expensive sedan, a $1,625 difference. The most expensive wagon costs $20,650, only $655 more than the costliest sedan. **********A Honda spokesman said the value of the station wagon was enhanced this year by the addition of a driver's side air bag as standard equipment. The sedan has featured an air bag since last year. **********Executives of Detroit's Big Three, who have watched glumfaced as Honda's Civic, Accord and Acura models have inexorably devoured their sales since 1973, can barely conceal their glee now that Honda may finally have hit something short of a home run. **********\"It surely hasn't measured up to vaunted expectations,\" said Joel Pitcoff, a research analyst for the Ford Motor Company. \"If their strategy was to woo away Taurus and Sable owners, that's going to be a tough struggle.\" **********The Honda wagon is also struggling in a shrinking market. Throughout the 1980's, mini-vans steadily gained ground as the multipurpose vehicle of choice, while station wagon sales steadily declined. Since 1985, station wagon registrations have plummeted 57 percent, to 390,770 cars in 1990, while mini-van registrations have more than doubled in the same period, to 829,126 units.  Resisting the Mini-Van Trend **********Ford, for example, discontinued its full-sized wagons this year after annual sales had dwindled to less than 15,000 cars. It continues to make the Taurus and Sable wagons. **********But Honda has resisted the mini-van trend, preferring to invest in other projects like its Acura luxury models. The Acura Legend was the first Japanese luxury car to be sold in the United States and quickly captured a niche because it was priced slightly below European luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW and won more praise from reviewers than American luxury models like Lincoln and Cadillac. **********Since most shoppers consider domestic or foreign brands exclusively, Honda probably did not hope to attract much crossover business from Ford. Still, Honda has to wonder whether the Accord wagon possesses the attributes for its target audience: import buyers who like a sporty vehicle but need a roomier car than a sedan. **********Honda dealers say more changes in the pricing stategy could go a long way toward increasing sales. Generally, Honda cars have been so popular that the company has not offered rebates. But Honda will sometimes subsidize leases or pay incentives to dealers, which can indirectly lower a customer's price.  A Comparison With Subaru **********Mr. Scott, the Pennsylvania Honda dealer, said the Honda wagon \"drives and handles like the sedan and has more space, but it still could cost almost $2,000 more,\" taking into consideration options and incentives. **********\"At that price,\" he said, \"people start comparing with the Subaru wagon, which is $3,000 less, or they discover they can get something much bigger for about the same money.\" **********Last fall, a few months before the Accord wagon was available, John Lewis and Judith Bell-Lewis, his wife, of Lynchburg, Va., were hunting for a station wagon. They bought a four-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy wagon for $15,500. The Honda dealer had told him a comparably equipped wagon might cost $18,000. **********\"The Subaru was a great value,\" Mr. Lewis said. \"My wife owned a Honda Accord sedan and loved it, but we have no regrets.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/23/world/war-in-the-gulf-pow-s-iraq-shows-2-more-it-calls-us-airmen.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1991-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 589, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Shows 2 More It Calls U.S. Airmen", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: P.O.W.'S; Iraq Shows 2 More It Calls U.S. Airmen", "body_text": " **********Iraq showed what it said were two more captured American airmen on Baghdad television today and sought to link its handling of American captives to Israeli treatment of Palestinian detainees in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********[ Videotape of the captured airmen, broadcast in the United States, identified them as Maj.

Analysts predict that auto makers will increase sales incentives on new vehicles if sales do not improve in coming weeks. **********Sales of cars alone dropped 23 percent from the levels of a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.4 million, compared with 7.1 million in the period last year. Analysts had predicted the annual rate would be higher, and said the sales figures showed weak consumer demand. Sales of light trucks fell 1.1 percent. **********\"It seems to indicate the rebound that people were expecting might not occur until much later,\" said Michael Bowyer, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago. \"It will be difficult for the economy over all to generate a sustained recovery without participation by the auto makers,\" he added.  Rate Cut May Help **********Mr. Bowyer said the Federal Reserve's cut in short-term rates today and the subsequent cut in the prime rate by banks might help sales to some extent. But he added, \"I don't think you're going to see really improved car sales until consumers think the recession is over.\" **********The early September figures showed an unusually sharp drop for two reasons, analysts said. Sales to car-rental companies and other fleet buyers were weak in the recent 10-day period compared with a year earlier. Also, sales incentives were richer last year, when auto makers rushed to clear large dealer inventories after the Kuwait invasion. By comparison, current inventories on dealer lots are near a 20-year low. **********Even after considering those factors, however, \"there is no denying that real, underlying demand is exceptionally weak,\" said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. **********Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco, said he expected sales to pick up soon, given the number of redesigned models on showroom floors, particularly from the General Motors Corporation, the largest auto maker.

The only sales increase in its light-truck lineup was for its Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle. **********Chrysler's car sales, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, declined 35.6 percent in the period, to 10,300. Light-truck sales, however, were estimated to have increased by 29.4 percent, to 16,500. Chrysler reports sales only at the end of each month. **********Among the Japanese auto makers, the Honda Motor Company reported that sales remained steady at 10,231 United States-built cars, while the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales rose 3.7 percent.

[ Page A16. ] **********Representatives of the seven nations agreed in principle in London on Sunday that the Soviet Union should be offered a limited role in the International Monetary Fund.

They are hoping that during his visit to Kiev, Mr. Kohl will be able to impress that point on the Soviet leader, and induce him to present a program of sweeping economic change at the summit in London. **********Mr. Gorbachev needs to convince skeptical leaders like President Bush that he is truly prepared to reverse the course of Soviet economic history. Mr. Bush has been reluctant to support major Western aid to the Soviet Union, though he has indicated willingness to provide expert technical advice.

If the right program is presented in the right way, a consensus will develop. **********\"I can't guess the size of the package,\" the aide said. \"The public likes gigantic figures, but if the proposal is just to commit $100 billion over five years, no one will accept it. We're looking for a continuing investment program, and as each step is successfully reached, we will help support the next one.\" **********In public statements and conversations with leaders, Mr. Kohl has already begun lobbying on behalf of the Soviets. **********\"It is in our common interests to provide effective help -- aid and self-help -- to the Soviet Union and the young democracies of Eastern Europe in this critical transition phase,\" he said when he welcomed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada to Bonn recently. **********Participants in the annual economic conference of the Group of Seven, besides Chancellor Kohl, Mr. Mulroney and President Bush, will be the leaders of France, Britain, Italy and Japan. **********German officials acknowledge that, because of history and geography, Germany has special reasons for wanting to help the Soviets. But they said Germany would only support an aid package that was accompanied by profound economic reforms. Germany has committed itself to about $31 billion in loans, grants and credits to the Soviet Union, in part because of Moscow's assent to the unification of Germany. Much of the money has gone to provide housing and other aid for Soviet soldiers returning home.  'A Partnership of Governments' **********The Germans have traditionally seen large-scale business interests in the East, but besides the profits to be won, they are concerned that a breakdown in the Soviet Union could lead to colossal dislocation, with millions of Soviet and East European refugees. **********\"We want to make suggestions, but we can't behave as if we were the World Bank going into Uganda, designing a plan for them and then saying they have to accept or else there is no money,\" Economic Minister Jurgen Mollemann said in an interview. \"It has to be a partnership of governments.\" **********Mr. Mollemann and other officials said that the emergence of Boris N. Yeltsin had helped Mr. Gorbachev's position by showing the Soviet Union's progress toward democracy, and that overtures to the Baltic republics or an easing of emigration policies in the next few weeks would help even more. **********A Soviet concession to Japan on the disputed Kurile Islands would be necessary before the Japanese Prime Minister could support an aid program, officials here said. **********\"The reluctance on the Japanese side is even greater than the reluctance on the American side,\" said Otto Lambsdorff, who heads the Free Democratic Party and is an important ally of Mr. Kohl. \" A London Show-Stealer? **********\"Without Mr. Gorbachev, we would not have German unification,\" he said. \"We also know that if there is a serious economic collapse in the Soviet Union, there could be mass migration from East to West that would cause great problems in Germany and other countries of the European community.\" **********\"Unfortunately, the Soviet Union and Mr. Gorbachev have lost six years, and the situation there has become very bad,\" he continued. \"The list of Gorbachev's economic advisers is longer than the list of Italian Prime Ministers over the last 10 years. **********\"No money will be given without reforms, but you cannot have reforms without money,\" Mr. Lambsdorff said. \"What Mr. Gorbachev is going to put on the table, nobody knows.

In time, they began pulling out and the weeds and dust encroached on the prefabricated houses. 'You Don't Buy the Passengers' **********Professor Boshoff's movement bought Orania and 1,167 acres on which it sits a few months ago and set to work restoring the dilapidating town. The tidy-up included the eviction of about 500 residents from a mixed-race township just over the hill. Mr. Boshoff wants to convert it into a retirement village for aging Afrikaners. The original tenants, some of whom lived there for 23 years, were trucked to another town more than 100 miles away. **********\"They can't understand it, because all these years the white and black people were staying here,\" said Pieter Fisher, the 46-year-old school principal in the voided township. The removal, he said, hit the children hardest. **********\"There will be a great deal of bitterness that will stay for the rest of their life,\" he said, \"and they will never forget it.\" **********Professor Boshoff's followers contend that they can do what they want with their town, which was reportedly purchased for about $850,000 from a previous owner, who in turn bought it from the Government. **********\"When you buy a motorcar, you don't buy the passengers with it, do you?\" said Chris Smit, a gaunt 54-year-old with a tattooed chest who was renovating one bungalow. \"This is private property.\" **********His co-worker Pieter Oberholzer, 26, said a black man would be allowed to drive past Orania but not to stop for fuel or food. **********\"If his car breaks down, he just will have to push it out of town. Otherwise . . .\" Mr. Oberholzer completed his sentence with a brittle laugh. **********People of color are unwanted in Orania even as hired labor. Mr. Boshoff said Afrikaners must learn to cope without their black servants. Quick to Vent Prejudices **********His call for white self-sufficiency would give pause to many whites dependent on black help. Orania's apostles argue that doing one's own chores isn't that bad. **********\"To me, good hard work is a privilege,\" said Mr. Smit, a boilermaker and welder by trade. \"It's healthy. It keeps you bodily fit. Because people don't work that hard, that's what makes them fat.\" **********\"You have a black working for you and they mess it up,\" Mr. Smit said. **********Some other whites were as quick to vent their prejudices. Loudewyk van der Merwe, 56, an electrician who was rewiring the town auditorium, told a rambling tale about how his father, who quit his farm for the mines years ago, left 32 donkeys in the care of a black laborer who later sold them. High Technology in the Veld **********Professor Boshoff, a soft-spoken academic who taught at the University of Pretoria, wanted his nation-state to encompass Namaqualand, Bushmanland and the Karoo, semi-arid regions that he said included 30 percent of South Africa's territory but only 10 percent of its population. Creating a whites-only homeland around Pretoria or Johannesburg, he said, is no longer feasible. **********\"To try today to move millions of people is just impossible, so our idea is this,\" Mr. Boshoff said. **********President F. W. de Klerk has ruled out a white homeland, and the African National Congress has rejected racial partitioning of the country. But Professor Boshoff said he hoped that a black government would accept white secession as an alternative to armed rebellion. **********\"As far as I read the signs, it's a small price to pay,\" he said. **********Mr. Boshoff limned his vision of happy God-fearing whites prospering from a dimly defined high technology that would transform Orania into a sort of Silicon Valley on the veld. **********He predicted that his homeland's population would swell to two million Afrikaners. So far, only 14 families have settled in Orania. **********\"There's no work for a man,\" complained Mr. van der Merwe, who lives in Pretoria. He insisted that he would settle in Orania if he could find a steady job. **********Professor Boshoff, who commutes from Pretoria, said more than 50 of the town's 84 houses had been sold. **********Most Afrikaners show little interest in retreating to a rustic backwater whose brightest attractions are the stars at night. Other South Africans, black and white, have derided Professor Boshoff's project as unrealistic. **********\"If they want to protect their Afrikaner culture, they must teach it to their children,\" Mr. Fisher said. **********Mr. Boshoff, who from 1980 to 1983 headed the Broederbond, a secret society that advanced Afrikaner interests, spoke mystically of his \"volk,\" variously translated as nation or people.

Solow, head of the global banking group at Manufacturers, who reports to Thomas Johnson, the president. **********When Ms. Moore was introduced to debtor in possession financing in 1984, she recalled that it was an esoteric branch of finance confined to small companies. \"Now,\" she said, \"the list of D.I.P. financings reads like a Who's Who of American bankruptcy.\" **********Big loans in the last 15 months include Allied Stores with two loans totaling $1 billion, Ames Department Stores for $250 million and Carter Hawley Hale Stores for $800 million. The debtor financings are not limited to department stores; the Public Service Company of New Hampshire and Todd Shipyards have also filed for bankruptcy and asked for loans. **********Ms. Moore graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1976 and earned a M.B.A. from George Washington University in 1982. **********For relaxation, Ms. Moore returns to her family's tobacco farm in Lake City, S.C. \"Physical labor is the greatest mental therapy,\" she said. \"I like to lose myself on the tractor.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/business/your-own-account-finding-money-to-start-a-business.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Rowland", "pub_date": "1991-05-26", "snippet": "With bank credit tight and droves of corporate dropouts eager to start their own businesses, finding the necessary capital has become a big hurdle.\n\nNearly 20 percent of the people who get career counseling after losing corporate jobs are starting...", "word_count": 1045, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Own Account;\nFinding Money to Start a Business", "print_headline": "Your Own Account;\nFinding Money to Start a Business", "body_text": " **********With bank credit tight and droves of corporate dropouts eager to start their own businesses, finding the necessary capital has become a big hurdle. **********Nearly 20 percent of the people who get career counseling after losing corporate jobs are starting businesses rather than seeking new jobs, according to statistics compiled by James E. Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago outplacement firm. His statistics show that 80 percent of new entrepreneurs are over 40, which indicates that they have business experience. \"The rise of the older entrepreneur is one of the most significant trends in the workplace,\" he said. **********Business experience notwithstanding, many new entrepreneurs have no idea how to raise capital. The first thing they think about is looking for a venture capitalist, according to Carol Rivchun, vice president of marketing for the Greater Cleveland Growth Association, the local chamber of commerce. \"And that's the last thing most of them should do,\" she said. **********Venture capital firms invest the money of pension funds, college endowment funds and wealthy individuals who expect hefty returns in exchange for the high risk they take by investing in small businesses. Most venture capitalists aim for a 20 percent return. Because many of the ventures fail, they expect 40 to 50 percent from those that succeed. **********\"Our investors have asked us to seek out the next rapidly growing companies and invest early,\" says James F. Morgan, chairman of Morgan, Holland Ventures, a Boston firm. \"We have to see a chance to build a major business.\" What that means is a company that will grow to $50 million to $100 million in revenues in five to seven years. **********\"Our job is to find the next Digital Equipment, Federal Express or Apple Computer,\" Mr. Morgan said. \"If you want to finance a bed-and-breakfast, please don't come to us.\" **********Unlike many venture capital firms, Mr. Morgan's will talk to people with start-up ideas, but they must be blockbusters. \"We have started 10 companies,\" he said. \"Two or three of them were only at the stage of a dream when we first heard about them.\" What Mr. Morgan looks for in a start-up is credibility and experience on the part of the entrepreneur. **********For most entrepreneurs, friends, relatives and business contacts are a much better source of cash than venture capital. \"There is something between 5 to 10 times as much capital available from friends and relatives than from professional sources,\" Mr. Morgan said. He provided the example of a man in his mid-50's who left his company after a successful career and raised $650,000 from professional contacts. \"He went to all his cronies and got $25,000 or $50,000 from each one,\" Mr. Morgan said. **********To find this kind of money, an entrepreneur needs to do some networking. One of the best places to start is with the small business division of the local chamber of commerce. For example, Ms. Rivchun has been matching entrepreneurs and investors for 10 years. **********\"My Rolodex is famous,\" Ms. Rivchun says. \"I know all the bankers and lawyers and C.P.A.'s in town, and these are the people who know how much money their clients have lying around.\" **********Most of the money to start small businesses is \"raised by people scribbling on the tablecloth at lunch,\" she said. \"In every city there are people like me.\" **********Somewhere between professional venture capitalists and business cronies is the angel network, wealthy individuals who make equity investments in start-up companies. Finding angels has been made easier by the growth of angel networks like the Venture Capital Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. **********An investor or entrepreneur can sign up for a six-month listing on the network for $250. The entrepreneurs prepare business summaries that are sent to the prospective investors. \"The confidentiality of each is maintained until an investor wants an introduction,\" said Roger Wilson, executive director. Like professional venture capitalists, private investors look at about 100 plans and invest in one or two, he said. **********Because of the credit crunch, the network has recently seen established companies looking for angels, Mr. Wilson said. One of them was the DGH Corporation, a Manchester, N.H., company that computerizes manufacturing. David Dutile and his partner started the company in 1985 with their own funds. By 1987, they needed money to grow, and Mr. Dutile went to the Venture Capital Network. \"Within a month, we had five or six people who wanted to come in to see the company,\" he said. **********Mr. Dutile picked an investor who put in $100,000 at the beginning of 1988. \"I have the option of buying him out at the end of 1993 at $300,000,\" Mr. Dutile said. Although it was an expensive deal, Mr. Dutile is happy with the arrangement. \"He has really left us alone to run the company,\" he said. \"What you worry about is that you will sell the stock to someone who will want to come in and be your partner, especially if they know nothing about the business.\" **********For that reason, if you can start your business without venture or angel capital, you should. \"If you can bootstrap your business, you maintain more control, it costs less and you get more market feedback,\" Mr. Wilson said.A BUSINESS PLAN IS THE FIRST STEP **********Before you make your first call looking for start-up capital, you must have a plan. It should answer these questions: *********** How big is the market for your product or service? Who exactly will buy it and why do they need it? *********** How will you reach them and persuade them to buy it? The best product in the world is worth nothing if people don't realize they need it. \"I have this guy with a fabulous computer software program for doing surveys and polls,\" says Carol Rivchun, vice president of marketing for the Greater Cleveland Growth Association. \"The trouble is, there's no way to sell it. If he puts it in the store for $29.95, no one will appreciate it. And he can't sell it to a McKinsey & Company because they want to develop their own.\" *********** How much money do you need? *********** How long will you need it for? *********** When will you pay it back? **********Put your plan in writing, concisely. \"It you've put your thoughts on paper in an orderly way, it convinces people,\" Ms. Rivchun said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/business/company-news-zitel-unisys-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Zitel-Unisys Talks", "print_headline": "Company News; Zitel-Unisys Talks", "body_text": " **********The Zitel Corporation said that, because of disappointing results, it had begun talks with the Unisys Corporation on ending their co-marketing relationship involving Zitel's disk products designed for use with Unisys's mainframe computers.

Emilio Castro, did not find it necessary to mention the decade in solidarity with women in his report to the assembly on the council's activities since the last assembly in 1983, angering even women who think the council is doing a reasonably good job on women's matters. **********Although 35 percent of the delegates here are women, up from 31 percent in 1983, the goal for this assembly was 40 percent. **********The desk in charge of women's issues at council headquarters in Geneva was also a source of friction, having been without a director for many months, one reason women staged a sit-in in a recent executivecommittee meeting. **********The ordination of women, almost a given now in many Western churches, has long been controversial among Orthodox members, who regard the priesthood as a masculine affair \"by reasons of the Bible, tradition and history,\" said Bishop Moussa of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church. \"We were founded by St. Mark, one of the apostles, in the first century,\" he said in an interview, \"and we will stick to our traditions and positions even if others dismiss us.\" **********Bishop Moussa and other Orthodox delegates said they were even more upset by the increasingly inclusive theology of ecumenicism, which is incorporating traditions of other, originally non-Christian cultures. This melding is sometimes called \"inculturation\" here, or \"syncretism.\"The argument has focused on a South Korean theologian, Dr. Chung Hyun Kyung of the Korean Presbyterian Church, who gave a presentation on the assembly theme, \"Come Holy Spirit -- Renew the Whole Creation.\" Using Asian dance and other non-Western motifs, she invoked the \"Han-spirits\" of the martyred and murdered and linked them with the Holy Spirit. **********Dr. Chung, who has a doctorate in theology from the Union Theological Seminary in the United States, said she was among the first of the \"post-colonial theologians,\" and rejected charges of syncretism and paganism.

The one-year bills, meanwhile, rose by a basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.83 percent. The Treasury plans to auction $11.75 billion in new one-year bills on Thursday.  Federal Funds Rate **********As expected, the Federal Reserve continued its struggle to raise the funds rate that banks and large financial insititutions charge each other for temporary loans.

Research Requests Denied **********\"Why has the company held back on work in this country?\" he asked, noting that at least two research centers, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University, had asked the company to cooperate in breast cancer studies but were turned down in the last two years. **********Instead, the company has decided to work through Canada's National Cancer Institute to carry out a study of the drug's potential in breast cancer. **********Dr. Mouttet said Roussel-Uclaf had difficulty considering work in the United States because it was unable to understand what the nation \"is doing on the abortion issue.\" She noted with pleasure the announcement on Tuesday by Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York that he and 29 other mayors would support bringing RU486 to the United States both as an abortion drug and as a drug for other uses. **********But she said she was shocked at the Bush Administration's rule barring counselors in federally financed family planning clinics from discussing abortion with clients. **********Because the United States is divided on the issue, she said, the company fears that any entry into the country could trigger boycotts against the company. **********She said that researchers doing small-scale studies in the United States on other uses of the drug would still be supplied with the drug, but that large-scale work was not contemplated. **********Canada, she said, was a more likely country for Roussel-Uclaf to market the drug as an abortifacient because that country is not as polarized on the issue of abortion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/29/business/fda-gets-tough-on-drugs-offered-for-unapproved-uses.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1991-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.D.A.

Gets Tough on Drugs Offered for Unapproved Uses", "body_text": " **********At least 400 million of the 1.6 billion prescriptions that American doctors write each year are for treatments that lack the Food and Drug Administration's approval as safe and effective, physicians and Government scientists say. **********Doctors say that research and experience justify their confidence in the benefits of these treatments. But scientists warn that many drugs certified for some uses can have dangerous, unanticipated side effects in other uses, especially over long periods. **********After years of scant Federal enforcement, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. David A. Kessler, is seeking to prosecute drug companies that promote unapproved treatments and to tighten the general policing of the marketing of prescription drugs.  Big Unauthorized Sales **********These unauthorized uses generate billions of dollars in sales. In some cases, Dr. Kessler recently told a group of the drug industry's lobbyists, \"promotional practices, to be blunt, have gotten out of hand.\" **********But many doctors and drug makers say they are keeping patients alive with treatments that the F.D.A. might take years to approve. Physicians can legally prescribe drugs for uses that the Government has not sanctioned and that the drug companies are not allowed to advocate. Many doctors support the agency's crackdown only if it does not curtail their access to the latest scientific findings, which they often hear about from drug makers. **********\"The F.D.A. ought to be very careful not to prohibit widespread and immediate dissemination of important new information that can save lives,\" said Peter Barton Hutt, an industry consultant and former F.D.A. official. **********The Government itself promotes some unauthorized uses. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute often encourage doctors to try new cancer treatments that lack F.D.A. approval by enrolling their patients in hundreds of test groups around the country. **********Physicians and Government officials estimate that more than half of all cancer prescriptions and 40 percent of those for heart ailments are for drugs approved only for other uses. A Bristol-Myers Squibb drug, Paraplatin, is certified only for treating recurrent cancer of the ovaries. But with current F.D.A.-sanctioned tests already showing that Paraplatin can help treat many other forms of cancer, the institute is encouraging doctors to try these other applications. **********Sometimes, though, treatments the F.D.A. has not authorized can do more harm than good. Dr. Kessler raises the example of calcium channel blockers, approved for treating high blood pressure and angina but also promoted for treating heart attacks. Researchers have found that heart attack patients with congested lungs are actually less likely to survive if treated with calcium blockers than if they received placebos. **********A spokesman for Marion Merrell Dow Inc., which makes Cardizem, a widely used calcium channel blocker, said that after talks with F.D.A. officials earlier this year, the company's sales people had stopped telling doctors about journal articles that appeared to favor treating heart attacks with calcium blockers. Cardizem, Marion Merrell Dow's largest- selling drug, had sales of $750 million in 1990. **********Dr. Kessler, a 39-year-old physician and lawyer who became commissioner last November, promises to speed the approval process even as he tightens enforcement. Dr. Kessler has doubled the F.D.A.'s advertising enforcement staff and ordered it to issue tighter guidelines by December. The F.D.A. has already referred a case involving Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health-care company, to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.  Retin-A Used for Wrinkles **********Johnson & Johnson confirmed that the United States Attorney for northern New Jersey in Newark had told the company that he was investigating its promotion of Retin-A to prevent wrinkling. Although the drug has F.D.A. approval only to treat acne, half of its $100 million in annual sales are for treating wrinkles, according to Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Johnson & Johnson said it had made no improper claims for Retin-A. **********Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, who heads the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization, said that he could not recall any prosecutions of unauthorized drug promotion \"in my 20 years in Washington.\" F.D.A. officials say they are considering several more cases for referral to the Justice Department. **********Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, a senior vice president of the American Medical Association, said at least 25 percent of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled last year were for unapproved treatments. Many of the most popular drugs owe much of their sales to uses the F.D.A. has yet to approve. **********The Upjohn Company's Rogaine has been approved only to treat baldness in men, but some doctors also prescribe it for hair loss in women. In September 1989 the company asked the F.D.A. to approve the drug's broader use. Eli Lilly & Company's Prozac, widely used for depression, is also being prescribed for obesity, a treatment the agency is now considering. Both companies say they do not promote the unapproved treatments. **********Genentech and Eli Lilly say they have tried to prevent their genetically engineered human growth hormone from being used for purposes besides the approved treatment of dwarfism in children. Athletes have used the drug to build muscles, and some doctors have prescribed the hormone to rejuvenate elderly men. **********In other cases of unapproved drug uses, the F.D.A. has tried to curb company promotion efforts. Dr. Kessler said that the Collagen Corporation, producers of Collagen, an animal fiber injection approved for smoothing acne scars, had been promoting its use by cosmetic surgeons for puffing up lips. Under F.D.A. pressure, the company has agreed to stop promoting that use.   Marketing Programs Canceled **********Despite the current tests of Bristol-Myers' Paraplatin, earlier this month the F.D.A. required the company to cancel some of its marketing programs. The company had to write to doctors saying that it had paid for a publication, \"Oncology Commentary,\" that promoted Paraplatin and five other Bristol-Myers cancer drugs for treatments not approved by the F.D.A. **********\"Our paid agents included only favorable opinions and data on our products for inclusion in Oncology Commentary,\" wrote John C. O'Leary, a Bristol-Myers vice president.The company also agreed to get F.D.A. clearance for all its cancer drug promotions over the next two years. **********Jerry Parrott, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said that even though the F.D.A. had not approved the uses of the cancer drugs, they had won acceptance in physician's reference books and the computerized information service maintained by the National Cancer Institute. **********The F.D.A already permits the wide use of some unapproved drugs being tested for treatment of life-threatening diseases like cancer and AIDS.   Approval Can Take Years **********Most drugs have F.D.A. approval for only one or two narrowly defined uses. Doctors and drug company executives say that winning approval for new uses can take years, while lives may be at stake. The heart of the problem, said Dr. Gerald P. Murphy, an Atlanta cancer surgeon who is the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, \"is the long time it takes to get something approved.\" **********Dr. Bruce Chabner, director of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute, said that once the F.D.A. approved a drug, further research often suggested additional uses. \"We think it's important that those uses become part of the approved menu for a drug,\" he said. **********Bob Allnutt, an executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, said 122 applicaitons for additional drug uses were pending at the F.D.A. Hundreds more are in various stages of F.D.A.-approved testing. **********Many insurers, including many Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, do not pay for treatments that lack F.D.A. approval. But the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association currently recommends paying for unapproved uses if the National Cancer Institute is testing them. \"The bottom line for us is to be sure that the clinical trials for these drugs are covered by insurers,\" Dr. Chabner said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/05/business/sharp-rise-for-bonds-on-jobs-data.html": {"writer_name": "Sylvia Nasar", "pub_date": "1991-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 686, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sharp Rise For Bonds On Jobs Data", "print_headline": "Sharp Rise For Bonds On Jobs Data", "body_text": " **********Bond prices rose smartly yesterday after the Government released a so-so employment report that showed that the economic recovery continued to limp in September. **********\"The economy is still moving up, but employment growth is falling short of the norm by a wide margin,\" said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs. The economy generated just 24,000 non-farm jobs in September, or 224,000 since payrolls hit bottom last April. **********Rates on Treasury bills, on the other hand, barely budged. They had headed down earlier in the week on widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease credit. **********But the Fed apparently did not ease yesterday, sticking to a recent pattern of letting the markets nudge rates down before the central bank steps in. \"By hanging fire like this, the Fed isn't threatening the improvement in inflation expectations,\" said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. **********While bond prices rallied over the course of the day, traders said a flurry of selling occurred early in the morning immediately after the employment report. Some traders initially interpreted the downtick in the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent, upward revisions in the numbers of jobs created in July and August, and a rise in the average workweek as signs that the recovery was stronger than had been thought. There was another flurry after President Bush said, in a news conference about a Democratic measure to extend unemployment benefits, that the economy was, indeed, recovering. **********But these selling spurts soon gave way to buying as traders focused on the small rise in the number of payroll jobs in September and an outright decline in jobs in the factory sector -- one of the economy's few bright spots this summer. Further, hourly earnings data for September suggested that inflation pressures remained under control. Hourly earnings were 3.2 percent higher in September than a year earlier, compared with 3.6 percent in June.  30-Year Bond Jumps **********By the close of the New York cash market, the Treasury's 30-year bellwether issue jumped 23/32, to 104, to yield 7.77 percent, a four-and-a-half-year low, and down from 7.83 percent on Thursday. **********Ten-year notes with a 7 7/8 percent coupon rose by 16/32 to yield 7.37. Two-year notes with a 6 1/8 coupon due in 1993 rose 4/32, to 100.15, to yield 5.87. **********Six-month Treasury bills edged down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.07 percent, while three-month T-bills were flat, with a rate of 5.02 percent. **********Coming on top of slow money growth, traders and economists said, slow job growth points to further easing by the Federal Reserve. That prospect is good for bonds because lower short-term rates would be likely to prompt more investors to shift their funds out of C.D.'s into bonds. **********Many traders expect the Fed to move to push the Federal funds rate down by no more than a notch, from around 5.25 percent to 5 percent this month. The Federal funds rate, the interest rate on overnight loans between banks, fluctuated between a low of 4.75 and a high of 5.18 yesterday. **********The easing could come within a week, said Steven I. Saslow, executive managing director at Carroll McEntee & McGinley, a primary dealer in government securities. \"The Fed gets the next week's money supply numbers on Tuesday, and if they are very weak, they may ease that day.\" **********Not everyone thinks that the Fed will necessarily ease, however, mostly because there have been scattered of signs that business and consumer buying firmed a bit last month. \"There's no compelling reason for the Fed to ease,\" said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns. **********According to recently released data, sales of new houses jumped in August. Car and truck buying revived a bit in September after stalling in August. And consumer confidence edged higher in September, according to the University of Michigan survey. In the meantime, factory order backlogs continued to climb in August and commodity prices have stopped falling. **********\"What will matter a great deal this month,\" said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities, \"are indicators of final demand like retail sales. If these show a pickup, the Fed should hold policy steady for a while.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/17/world/hostages-release-bogged-in-details.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1991-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOSTAGES' RELEASE BOGGED IN DETAILS", "print_headline": "HOSTAGES' RELEASE BOGGED IN DETAILS", "body_text": " **********The release of more Western hostages from Lebanon, which seemed imminent a few days ago has become embroiled in complicated negotiations surrounding the logistical details of an exchange, Western diplomats say. **********\"Our understanding is that we are in the preliminary stages of the negotiations to determine the logistical arrangements for any trade,\" a high-ranking Western diplomat in Damascus said. **********The obstacles, however, have not dampened the optimism here that the 10 Western hostages believed to be held in Lebanon will be freed eventually in return for the release of about 300 Arabs under the control of Israel and information on the fate of seven missing Israeli servicemen.  Frenzy of Diplomacy **********Syrian, Israeli, American, German, Lebanese, Iranian and United Nations officials have been scurrying from one capital to another during the last few days to work out agreements. **********The Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, left for Bonn on Sunday for talks with the German Government on the hostage issue. There are two Germans among the 10 hostages. **********Israel's top negotiator, Uri Lubrani, met with the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, on Sunday in Paris, and the Lebanese Foreign Minister is in Teheran for talks about the hostage situation. **********John Kelly, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East and African Affairs, held talks on Saturday in Beirut with Lebanese officials. **********All those engaged in the face-to-face negotiations insist that a solution is not far away. **********\"I'm optimistic there could be something,\" Mr. Sharaa said. **********The Syrian Foreign Minister said he had no idea whether the next hostage to be released would be British or American, though speculation has centered around a British hostage, Jack Mann, a 77-year-old former airline pilot who had lived in Beirut for 43 years before his abduction on May 12, 1989. **********There are five Americans, two Britons, two Germans and an Italian currently believed to be held by the Party of God, an Iranian-backed militant Shiite group. The Party of God is reportedly the umbrella organization for the kidnappers of most of the hostages. **********When Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, who was kidnapped from his home in Lebanon by Israeli commandos on July 28, 1989, was not released on Wednesday with 51 Arab prisoners, many in the leadership of the Party of God expressed anger. Israel also turned over the bodies of nine guerrillas. **********Israeli officials insist that it is up to the Party of God to make the next move and have said that the Sheik, arguably Israel's best bargaining chip, would be among the last to be released. **********Mr. Lubrani said that if another hostage was released, Israel would \"reciprocate.\"  Two Held in Germany **********Perhaps one of the thorniest issues revolves around the imprisonment in Germany of two brothers, Mohammed and Abbas Ali Hamadei. **********Mohammed Hamadei was sentenced to life in prison for his part in the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines flight in 1985; Abbas Ali Hamadei was arrested on charges of carrying explosives and ordered to stand trial in the abduction of two Germans in Beirut, who were taken shortly after Mohammed Hamadei was jailed. **********A third brother, Abdul Hadi Hamadei, is in charge of the Party of God's security apparatus in Beirut and is wanted on terrorism charges in the United States. **********The Syrian and German officials who are meeting to discuss the hostage issue in Bonn have rejected demands that the release of the Hamadeis be tied to the freeing of Western hostages. But many Western diplomats expect there will have to be some understanding involving the fate of the two brothers. **********The issue of Iranian hostages is also one that negotiators must solve before any deal is completed, Western diplomats said. **********The Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen captured four Iranians in North Lebanon during the Israeli invasion in July 1982. The men are widely believed to have been killed by their captors, but the Iranians have repeatedly said they would only help to free Western hostages if their own missing were included in any deal. **********Finally, the Israelis continued to demand a complete accounting of all of their missing soldiers. The body of one of the seven, Sgt. Samir Assad, was returned to the Israeli authorities from Syria by a radical Palestinian group in the last week. **********The secretary general of the Party of God said in May that the organization was holding two of the Israelis.

Kalikow, one of New York's biggest developers and publisher of The New York Post, is fighting to keep control of his empire. He is being pressed by some of his lenders to pledge to them almost all of his personal and corporate assets against tens of millions of dollars of unsecured loans, Mr. Kalikow and other people in the talks said this week. **********Under a plan that Mr. Kalikow said he intended to head off even if it meant seeking protection in bankruptcy court, the lenders are trying to force Mr. Kalikow to put the newspaper and nearly everything else he owns into a pool that would be controlled by the banks. The pool would be used to shore up uncollateralized, as well as undersecured, loans to the developer, some of which he has failed to pay off or keep current with interest payments. **********Mr. Kalikow, who has for many years been regarded as one of the richest men in the country, owes more than $1 billion to more than a dozen lenders including the Travelers Companies and some of the nation's largest banks like Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover. With the sharp decline in New York real estate values, however, the banks believe that Mr. Kalikow owes about $242 million more than his buildings are worth. His latest troubles began when he failed to repay about $50 million in loans that were due at the beginning of the year. **********As for The Post, the lenders want to include it in the pool of assets that might be managed by a group appointed by the lenders. The details of who would manage the assets and the paper have not been discussed, however. **********Under the plan, Mr. Kalikow would wind up with only his Manhattan triplex apartment on Fifth Avenue near the Metropolitan Museum of Art, about $2 million worth of money owed to him as receivables, and his clothing, household furnishings and jewelry.  What Banks Want as Collateral **********Among the things the banks want Mr. Kalikow to put up as collateral for the unsecured debt are his equity in his New York real estate, which includes the office tower at 101 Park Avenue near Grand Central Terminal, his collection of rare cars, a private jet, a 137-foot yacht and a country home. **********Mr. Kalikow said yesterday in an interview that in no instance would he agree to a plan that would let the banks force him to sell The Post. **********\"I am not going to be forced to liquidate; otherwise I won't do a deal,\" Mr. Kalikow said. \"The New York Post has been profitable every month since October and will be profitable again in June. It certainly will not be sold as part of any bank plan.\"  The Creditors' Plan **********Mr. Kalikow expressed confidence that an acceptable compromise plan can be achieved soon that would leave him with more of his personal assets. **********\"In the last 10 days we feel it's pulled together to the point where you're dealing in weeks for this thing to be finished,\" he added. **********The creditors are putting together a plan that would take control of the management of H. J. Kalikow & Company away from Mr. Kalikow and begin an orderly liquidation of some of his assets over the next few years to raise cash. **********In addition to a general pool of collateral, the proposal that was given to Mr. Kalikow yesterday provides for a three- to five-year extension of the due date on most of his loans, with a minimum interest rate payment that has yet to be determined. The balance of interest would accrue at the original contract rate and would be paid out of cash flow. If there were no extra cash flow, then the interest would accrue as principal and would be payable at the maturation date. **********Mr. Kalikow, 48 years old, inherited a company worth tens of millions of dollars from his father and owns about 3,660 New York apartments. He is vowing to file for bankruptcy protection before allowing his lenders to force him to liquidate any assets. **********\"Forced liquidation is not preferable to a bankruptcy and it's something I'll never agree to,\" Mr. Kalikow said yesterday. Another Sticking Point **********Another big sticking point between the banks and Mr. Kalikow is that the developer wants to be released from all his personally guaranteed debt immediately, which the banks are refusing to do. Mr. Kalikow has personally guaranteed debts of about $184.6 million. The Bankers Trust Company holds $55 million of that. And according to Mr. Kalikow's reports, he has about $835.3 million of debt secured by some of his assets. **********In April Mr. Kalikow suggested to the banks that he put up his office towers and most of his apartment buildings as collateral for the unsecured debt. **********\"The assets I'm giving are more than enough to cover the banks' liabilities,\" he said yesterday. **********In addition, Mr. Kalikow also proposed that the banks allow him to receive an annual salary of $2.25 million as part of the restructuring. Several people in the talks said most of the big banks had rejected this request as too high, but it was still too early in the talks to determine how much salary Mr. Kalikow would receive in the event of a restructuring. **********The bank proposal that Mr. Kalikow received yesterday is still a very preliminary volley in the struggle to restructure his empire. There is an enormous amount of friction between those banks that have secured loans and those that lent the developer tens of millions of dollars backed solely by his personal guarantee. In a bankruptcy the lenders without collateral stand to lose the most. **********With the collapse of commercial real estate values nationwide, and a severe shortage of money for developers who need to refinance their properties, battles between builders and banks like that between Mr. Kalikow and his lenders are now commonplace. Although some bankers have said they are confident that the Kalikow negotiations will not disintegrate into a bankruptcy filing, others are less certain. Some of the banks, particularly those with small, unsecured loans to the developer, have threatened to put him into involuntary bankruptcy if their loans are not repaid.  Some Banks Are Suing **********Several banks, including Marine Midland Bank and the European American Bank have already sued Mr. Kalikow and, along with several other banks, demanded immediate payment of loans. Some people involved in the talks suggested that at least one bank, Community National Bank, which is owed $1.7 million, might actually be bought out through some agreement with the other creditors. **********Complicating the restructuring is the confusion over how far real estate values have fallen in New York in the last two years. Mr. Kalikow's assessment of the value of his assets far exceeds the estimates by the banks. This difference has generated what are known in financial argot as deficiency claims, or the difference between what a property is worth and the amount a bank has lent against it. **********In an April proposal that Mr. Kalikow presented to his lenders, he estimated that his assets were worth $1.2 billion if he continued to operate the apartments and about three million square feet of commercial real estate as is. Optimistically, he estimated then that the holdings would be worth $1.4 billion. **********Mr. Kalikow also noted, however, that if the assets were liquidated immediately in a fire sale, they could generate about $926 million. **********In that report Mr. Kalikow also said his equity was worth $194 million after accounting for debt. According to the banks, however, Mr. Kalikow has only $184 million in equity in those assets, after accounting for what he owes on them. But he also owes unsecured debt of more than $426 million (which includes deficiency claims by the banks) that would wipe out his net worth, leaving him with a negative net worth of about $242 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/20/business/company-news-mccaw-cellular.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McCaw Cellular", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; McCaw Cellular", "body_text": " **********McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it would buy cellular telephone systems in Florida and Texas for $105.3 million.

Jessica Reif, senior vice president of Oppenheimer & Company, said she expected CBS would write off $200 million or more in losses, based primarily on its expensive contracts with baseball and the National Football League. CBS 'Still in a Hole' **********A senior CBS executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, \"This is what baseball was supposed to do as programming, but we're still in a hole.\" **********Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, called the series \"thrilling, about as exciting a series as has ever been played.\" But he, too, noted that the value of the games could never catch up to the price CBS paid for them. **********\"In the face of higher costs and lower revenues,\" Mr. Stringer said, \"this was a hiccup on the road to nowhere.\" **********But for the most part, CBS executives were buoyant about baseball's performance. George Schweitzer, senior vice president of corporate communications, said: \"Baseball is re-energized as sport. We'll start our marketing plan for next year starting next week. We'll be taking around the highlight reel from these games.\" **********The series was the longest ever played in terms of innings, because three games went into extra innings. As a result, it had more commercials than any previous series. **********In effect, CBS telecast more than seven and a half games. Some of the commercials in the extra innings provided bonus revenue for CBS; the rest went to satisfy other requirements, like filling out the commitments to sponsors who had paid for commercials during pitching changes that did not take place. **********Each of the three additional games added between $10 million and $12 million for CBS, Mr. Schweitzer said. **********The total would have been much higher if not for the the softness of the sports television market, he added. Despite the attractiveness of the late games in the series, CBS was still not able to attract high prices for commercial time in those games because the marketplace was so weak, Mr. Schweitzer said. **********One reason for that weakness was the abundance of sports events on television. Indeed, CBS found itself competing for much of Sunday night against the football game between the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins, carried on the cable channel ESPN. **********\"That should have been our game with the N.F.L.,\" under the network's regular contract, Mr. Stringer said. \"Instead we have to compete against it when it plays on cable.\" CBS research estimated the network lost 1.5 ratings points because so many natural sports viewers, especially in New York and Washington, were watching the football game. **********But the series' average ratings will still be well above the guarantee the network made to advertisers, about 20. **********One advertiser that took full advantage of CBS's success was the General Motors Corporation, which cut a special series of commercials last Thursday to insert in Saturday and Sunday nights' games. Phil Guarascio, the executive in charge of corporate marketing and advertising for G.M., said his company was \"extremely satisfied\" with its CBS baseball deal because it provided so much exposure for a new incentive program for three G.M. models. **********David F. Poltrack, senior vice president of research for CBS, said the series was \"good news for a variety of reasons.\" Among those he cited: CBS will be able to sell commercial time in next year's series at much higher rates; CBS was able to cement its position as the leading prime-time network, and CBS may be able to increase interest in other coming \"event\" sports programming, including the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. **********\"The series reconfirmed the status of event programming,\" Mr. Poltrack said. \"Hopefully it will help create a better atmosphere for selling these events in the future.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/business/company-news-steelmakers-grim-outlook-for-the-year.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1991-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steelmakers' Grim Outlook For the Year", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Steelmakers' Grim Outlook For the Year", "body_text": " **********Executives of the nation's largest steel companies attending the annual meeting of the American Iron and Steel Institute conference here said today that the industry would lose tens of millions of dollars this year, making 1991 the worst year of industry losses since 1986, when the losses totaled $4 billion. **********The officials said they could do little to reverse the situation, since they had cut costs and trimmed operations almost as much as possible. **********\"After four years of positive operating results, steelmakers began posting losses in the third quarter of 1990 and these losses continued through the first quarter of 1991,\" said David H.

H. Marsden, the president and chief executive of the Acme Steel Company, the smallest of the leading integrated steelmakers.  Drop in Shipments Seen **********Mr. Hoag painted a bleak picture for the industry for the remainder of the year, particularly concerning steel demand. He predicted that domestic steel shipments would fall to 73 million tons to 76 million tons this year, down from the 85 million tons in 1990. **********\"Auto sales in the first quarter of 1991 were the lowest since 1982,\" he said. \"The continuing slump in new-home construction, combined with a drop in contracts awarded for major building projects indicates that the contruction market has yet to hit bottom.\" **********Car makers buy a quarter of the steel produced in the country, while the construction industry accounts for about 35 percent of demand. **********Mr. Hoag added that shipments of home appliances fell by 25 percent in the first quarter of the year.

Officials now hope it will save the town from the economic collapse that is threatening much of eastern Germany. **********\"Weimar does not need and does not want a heavy industrial base,\" said the newly elected Mayor, Klaus Buttner. \"We need new businesses here, but we aren't inviting every speculator from the west who wants to build a video game center. Our real goal is to make Weimar one of Europe's cultural capitals, and we consider it a very realistic goal.\" **********More than three million tourists visited Weimar last year, and figures for this year will probably show a considerable increase.  Home of Enlightenment **********Unlike many towns in what used to be East Germany, Weimar boasts an attractive downtown marked by well-scrubbed facades. Museums and monuments celebrate its humanistic tradition. **********Homes that once belonged to Goethe and Schiller, separated by only a few blocks, are the city's principal attractions. The enlightened ideals the two men shared, and their devotion to what Schiller called \"the spirit of freedom,\" are cornerstones of Weimar's history. **********At gift shops here, sales clerks are well schooled in local lore.

A bit farther out is the first home of the Bauhaus school of design, which was founded here by Walter Gropius in 1919. The building is now a school of architecture with an international student body. **********The founding of the Bauhaus was not the only momentous event that took place in Weimar in 1919. That year, the German Parliament met here and proclaimed the Weimar Republic. **********The town that produced much of Germany's richest culture, and which represents some of the greatest achievements of the German people, also played a tragic role in the Nazi era. On an incongruously peaceful hillside 10 miles outside of town is the Buchenwald concentration camp, where 65,000 men, women and children died. **********Residents of Weimar speak openly about the camp, and tourist guides encourage people to visit the memorial there. The name Buchenwald, however, is rarely heard here. People refer to the camp simply as \"da oben\" -- \"up there.\" **********To many people who live here unification has meant what it means for people throughout eastern Germany: sudden economic dislocation, high prices, skyrocketing unemployment and profound insecurity. **********\"In the old days, you got your job and a kindergarten space for your kids without even thinking about it,\" Jakob Wolf, a 57-year-old schoolteacher, said as he walked along Schillerstrasse. \"Now you never know if you're going to be called in and fired from one day to the next. Naturally people are upset. They remember that the old system was better in some ways.\" **********In an upstairs office at the National Theater, Christina Schild, who helped lead protests against the East German Government in 1989, now works as a publicity agent. She resisted appeals that she run for Parliament last year, and now she watches politics as an outsider. 'People Feel Helpless' **********\"Unifying Germany was absolutely not our goal when we started the protest movement,\" Miss Schild said. \"We wanted to find some kind of a third way that wouldn't submerge us entirely in the market economy. But that turned out not to be what people wanted.\" **********\"Lots of people feel helpless now. The psychological effect of all these changes has been awful. Now when you meet a friend on the street, the first thing you ask is not 'How are you?' but 'Do you still have a job?' \" **********The shock of such change has led some people to quiet frustration, others to petty crime and still others to street attacks on foreigners. But to some people in Weimar, especially the young, German unification has been an undreamed-of blessing, the sudden opening of vast new possibilities. A Student's View **********\"My grandmother used to tell me not to think about abandoning East Germany, because the day would come when I'd be free to travel and do whatever I want here,\" said Gudrun Potke, a 21-year-old student. \"I never believed her, but she turned out to be right.\" **********\"I always believed that we had the better system in the east, the better society. Now I see that wasn't true. Everything was better on the other side.\" **********The German Government, battered by complaints that it is not doing enough for cities and towns in the east, recently announced a package of grants including $65 million for Weimar. Part of it will be spent to refurbish the downtown area, and the rest will be used to build a warehousing and light industry complex in the nearby countryside. Coca-Cola will be one of the tenants. **********\"Weimar is one of the few cities in eastern Germany that has a lot worth saving, and we're going to save it all,\" Mayor Buttner said. \"We want to develop, but we want the kind of development that Goethe would approve of.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/business/credit-markets-rjr-nabisco-issue-receives-ratings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RJR Nabisco Issue Receives Ratings", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; RJR Nabisco Issue Receives Ratings", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investors Service assigned a B2 rating yesterday to the preferred equity redemption culmulative stock, or Percs, of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, and it placed the $1.9 billion issue on its review list with the possibility of an upgrade. **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation, meanwhile, gave the issue a BB- rating and also said it would consider an upgrade. **********Moody's said the Percs had \"strong equity characteristics,\" and noted that RJR Nabisco had stated that it hoped to exchange common stock for preferred. **********Moody's also said it wondered whether \"this infusion of equity represents an enduring change in the orientation towards financial risk on the part of RJR Nabisco's management.\" RJR Nabisco has a large amount of high-interest debt outstanding."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/25/business/tax-changes-in-argentina.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Changes in Argentina", "print_headline": "Tax Changes in Argentina", "body_text": " **********The Economy Minister of Argentina submitted a far-reaching package of tax changes today that includes canceling the income tax for wage-earners. **********The income tax, now 20 percent, would be replaced by levies based on company earnings, the minister, Domingo Cavallo, said at a news conference.

He said Prime Minister Cresson announced the plan today to her Cabinet, and would seek to carry out the merger in early 1992. **********Today's announcement comes just a few months after other Government officials blocked Mrs. Cresson's ambitious plans to turn France's ministries of finance, industry and the treasury into a giant like Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Merger of Money Losers **********Thomson's consumer electronics business lost $498 million last year on revenues of $6.1 billion. SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor joint venture that Thomson has with the IRI group of Italy, lost $97 million last year on revenues of $900 million. That joint venture will continue, though Thomson's stake in it will now be owned by the newly combined French company. **********French officials have long complained that SGS-Thomson is too small to compete with Japan's semiconductor companies. They have felt frustrated that the European Community has fought the French Government's efforts to provide research and devleopment subsidies to Thomson. **********This week, France's industry minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had suggested that there would be an even more sweeping restructuring of the nation's electronics industry, which would have merged two other prominent companies into the high-technology giant: Groupe Bull, France's money-losing computer company, and France Telecom, the nation's highly profitable telephone company. **********Some industry officials said Bull and France Telecom were not included in today's announcement because negotiations were not finished. Another theory: The more ambitious plan was not incuded in today's announcement because France's powerful Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who generally opposes heavy Government involvement in industry, has clashed with Prime Minister Cresson over the restructuring. **********Last year, the Atomic Energy Commission had $314 million of profits on revenues of $5.55 billion. France Telecom had profits of $1.03 billion in 1990, on revenues of $19.22 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/08/business/company-news-lockheed-rejects-simmons-proposal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lockheed Rejects Simmons Proposal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Lockheed Rejects Simmons Proposal", "body_text": " **********The stage has been set for another proxy fight for control of the Lockheed Corporation when the company rejected a proposal from the investor Harold C.

No matter, the students countered; their hallowed rites would continue in exile until a compromise could be reached. **********This has caused such consternation that the club's board is expected to meet this Wednesday to determine the future of what is perhaps the nation's most powerful secret society. Will women be accepted? That's \"up in the air,\" said Sidney Lovett, spokesman for the group's parent, the Russell Trust Association, named after the club's founder. **********Whatever the outcome, the brouhaha renews an old debate on the value that secret societies and other clubs have for members. Why, after all, are alums so anxious to preserve the Skull and Bones macho mystique?  Is it truly the ultimate old-boy network? **********\"What gave Bones new life in the 80's was the pre-professional, networking aspect of the club,\" said Bill Essig '92, editor in chief of The Yale Daily News and not a member. \"Some people thought it would help them get jobs on Wall Street.\" **********Perhaps no secret society has a roster superior to that of Skull and Bones. Interested in leveraged buyouts? Call Stephen Schwarzman '69, president of the Blackstone Group, or Peter Lusk '60, chief operating officer of Forstmann-Leff. Commercial banking? Try Dan Davison '49, former chairman of U.S. Trust, or Lewis Lapham '31, former president of Bankers Trust. Corporate finance? Call Vince Van Dine '49, Morgan Stanley's advisory director, or William H. Wright Jr. '82, an associate at Morgan. **********Interested, instead, in the corporate life? Call Vernon Loucks '57, chief executive of Baxter Travenol, the big pharmaceutical company. Or Edmond Thornton '54, recently retired chief executive of the United States Silica Company, a mining and processing corporation in Ottawa, Ill. Or Muhammad Ahmed Saleh '68, head of the alumni board, who is a vice president of the Timex Corporation, the big Connecticut watchmaker. **********Today's most famous Bonesman is, of course, George Bush '48. Then there are Senators John Kerry, David Borin and John Chafee. Yet others:William F. Buckley Jr., McGeorge Bundy and William Sloane Coffin. **********Although President Bush has declined to comment on the issue of a coed Bones, the three Senators have expressed their support for it. But politicians aside, only a few Bonesmen would talk on the record about the club because Bonesmen aren't even supposed to admit they're Bonesmen. If the secret society is mentioned by name, they are expected to immediately leave the room. **********\"The importance of any old-boy network is usually overblown, and this is no different,\" said Charles Buck '69, first vice president for administration at Coldwell Banker in Laguna Hills, Calif. \"It's always difficult for people to assess an institution they don't have access to. There tends to be a lot of rumor about this sort of thing, and most of it's usually wrong.\" **********Said Richard Moser '63, president of R.& D. Funding, a high-technology venture capital firm in Santa Clara, Calif.: \"I suppose it's no better or worse an entree than membership in the glee club. There's nothing automatically beneficial about it in the professional world.\" **********\"Of course,\" he added, \"if you're hustling for opportunity, those contacts might be worth something. In my time, it was a real privilege.\" **********But during the 1980's -- when antidiscrimination suits broke down racial, ethnic and sexual barriers at most exclusive clubs -- the secret society floundered. In a recent letter to alumni, the 1991 delegation declared: \"Being a part of Bones is an embarrassment, a source of ridicule.\" **********Perhaps. Yet membership seems to have its benefits. There is an annual gathering at Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River owned by the Russell Trust. After it, new initiates reportedly receive a club pin -- a skull and crossbones in 18-karat gold, made by Tiffany and Company -- and a tax-free bonus of $15,000. If one of greatest myths surrounding membership is true, Bonesmen are guaranteed financial security for life -- if only to keep down-and-out alums from selling the society's secrets. Members routinely deny this, along with claims that the club is Connecticut's largest landholder. **********Naturally, sharing secrets fosters a certain closeness. And so it's no surprise that Skull and Bones has spawned several successful business partnerships. The most renowned may be that of William Donaldson and Dan Lufkin, members of \"D-121\" (delegations are named for the number of years between when they joined and 1832, the club's inception). Six years after graduation, the two men joined up with a chum from Harvard Business School, Dick Jenrette, and lent their names to an upstart brokerage firm. **********As one Bonesman said: \"Members are supposed to be selected on the basis of being the best and brightest, so there's a natural affinity to do business together. There's a certain trust, a certain comfort level, they develop in the club.\" **********That, of course, may be one reason women want into the club. \"When you're on campus, being in Skull and Bones isn't that big a deal,\" said Jodi Wilgoren '92, managing editor of The Yale Daily News and not a member. \"But when you get out, suddenly you're part of one of the most exclusive secret societies in the world and the President of the U.S. is a member of it, too.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/31/business/the-year-in-finance-newsmakers-in-1991-money-movers-caught-in-the.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-12-31", "snippet": "He was an aggressive investor who built a small Los Angeles company into one of the nation's largest insurers.

The Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency set up to oversee the bailout of savings institutions, said it had agreed to sell $1.15 billion in insured retail deposits to the American Savings Bank in Stockton, Calif., which is controlled by the Bass group of Fort Worth, for a small premium of $6.1 million. **********Because no buyer could be found for the remaining $3.25 billion in deposits, mainly certificates of deposits sold through brokerage houses, those will be returned to investors as payouts to be mailed to holders.

But some lawmakers immediately criticized the new plan for terms it offers potential buyers that they said could actually increase the cost of the bailout for taxpayers. **********The plan would offer new incentives to what officials called the nation's 50 to 100 most eligible investors to make bulk purchases of about $100 billion in commercial real estate, bad loans and other poor-quality assets. The Only Way Left **********L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is overseeing the bailout, said the new marketing strategy was the only way left to move the assets that the Government has been unable to sell, which include marinas, uranium mines and dozens of golf courses. **********\"If we sold $1 million a day in these kinds of assets, I calculated that it would take us 300 years to sell them all,\" Mr. Seidman said. \"We'll never make it by selling these things piece by piece. The only way to do it is by making large sales to large buyers.\" **********Under the new marketing strategy, the Government would negotiate a lower down payment on any purchase and in return would receive future payments for the rest of the purchase price out of the earnings on the assets. The arrangement means that the Government would continue to be at risk if a property declined further in value, but it would benefit by managing to obtain at least a potential income when it now has none.  Some Potential for Gain **********\"We will continue to have some risk, but we will share with the upside,\" said David C. Cooke, executive director of Resolution Trust, Mr. Cooke and Mr. Seidman, announced the new marketing strategy at a meeting today of the trust corporation's oversight board, which sets its policy. **********Members of the oversight board include Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Jack Kemp, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. **********Asked after the meeting about the significance of the new sales campaign, Mr. Brady said: \"It shows progress. People are going to be getting good deals.\" **********Officials said the move would reduce the overall cost of the bailout by moving property out of the Government's control and thus keeping down the enormous expenses associated with maintaining them. But some critics and members of Congress said the deals would ultimately add to the costs by further reducing and deferring payments by purchasers. **********'There is no certainty of payment, because payment is tied to performance,\" said Representative Bruce Vento, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of a House panel that has been monitoring the bailout. \"It lengthens the time of the bailout, and now the cost of it is even more uncertain.\" He said the new policy would be examined at a hearing next week. **********The lawmakers have already criticized as giveaways deals made by previous savings regulators in 1988 to sell almost 200 savings associations. Today the lawmakers began attacking the new sales strategy as providing preferential treatment to the wealthiest investors.  'Extreme Fire Sale' **********\"It's fraught with problems,\" said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the House Banking Committee. \"It has all the markings of an extreme fire sale. The notion of selling more than $80 billion of assets and providing financing through cash flows simply delays the ultimate risks to the taxpayers.\" **********Mr. Kennedy also objected to the idea of limiting the sales to a group of investors selected by the trust corporation. \"It reeks of the potential for real abuses,\" he said. **********Anticipating those complaints, regulators emphasized today that the plan would include only assets that the Government has been unable to sell after more than six months. **********Mr. Cooke said the list of eligible investors being compiled included the largest real estate developers and investors. He declined, however, to identify any of them. **********Senior officials said that three pending deals would kick off the program, but they declined to disclose details. The three deals are expected be completed in the next few weeks and to cover $1.2 billion in sales of office buildings, hotels and shopping malls around the nation. Speculation on Some Buyers **********But people in the banking industry said the proposed deals are with the General Electric Capital Corporation and with two investment groups, one led by the Tishman family and the other by John Daniels, a founder of Cadillac Fairview, one of the largest Canadian real estate developers with large holdings in the United States. Cadillac Fairview was acquired by the JMB Realty Corporation of Chicago in 1987 for $4.1 billion. The New York-based Tishman Realty and Construction Company built the World Trade Center and many other landmark developments. **********People involved in the three transactions said the General Electric Capital deal was for office buildings, shopping centers and industrial property valued at between $300 million and $500 million, and that the Tishman deal was for $300 million to $700 million in offices and hotels. The proposed $400 million deal being arranged with Mr. Daniels's investment group, Patriot American Investors, is said to involve office and hotel properties. **********In all three of the proposed deals, officials and industry executives said most of the Government's income on the sale of the properties would come from the future earnings of the office buildings, hotels and other assets being sold. Earlier Discounts Offered **********The new marketing strategy affects close to two-thirds of the Government's $162 billion in property seized from failed savings associations. It follows moves over the last year to deeply discount, and even give away, property that cannot be sold and to provide limited Government financing for buyers. The trust corporation has already announced its intention to sell most of its existing residential real estate and good loans as quickly as possible through dozens of sealed bids and auctions around the nation over the next few months. **********Mr. Seidman acknowledged that those moves had had only a limited effect on the rescue effort because the continuing seizures of savings associations have rapidly increased the Government's inventory of assets at the same time that commercial real estate markets have continued to decline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-c-r-clothiers-gets-co-chief-at-its-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C& R Clothiers Gets Co-Chief at Its Agency", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; C& R Clothiers Gets Co-Chief at Its Agency", "body_text": " **********One route to the top at C& R Clothiers, a California men's clothing chain, is through its ad agency. **********Jack Roth, the president of Admarketing, Los Angeles, C& R's agency, has been named co-chairman and co-chief executive of C& R.

The next morning, this city's largest-selling newspaper, El Colombiano, carried this front-page lead headline: \"Drug Trafficking Study Proposes Decriminalization and Elimination of Extradition.\" **********At an office here, a businessman looked up from the El Colombiano headline, sipped his morning cup of coffee and commented: \"The change in press coverage of drug trafficking has been brutal. There has been a total opening to the idea that the problem must be fixed quickly.\" **********In a new, perverse form of public relations, Medellin's powerful cocaine cartel has kidnapped nine journalists since August in an effort to end hostile press coverage. By holding the journalists captive, the traffickers are smothering open debate as Colombia's Government seeks to wind down the war on cocaine through truce talks with the traffickers. **********[ On Jan. 25, the police raided a hideaway near Medellin where traffickers were holding two journalists seized last August. Richard Becerra, a television cameraman, was freed. But the kidnappers shot Diana Turbay, a magazine editor, three times in the back, killing her, the police said. ] The Pain Brought Home **********Combined with South America's highest homicide rate of journalists, the kidnappings have dramatically brought the pain of the drug war home to reporters, editors and columnists. **********\"The treatment of drug trafficking has been different because the problem of drug trafficking has suddenly come very close to journalists,\" Juan Gomez Martinez, publisher of El Colombiano, said in an interview at the newspaper's tightly guarded offices here. **********\"Before journalists saw the problem as very far away, in Medellin, or happening to someone else,\" continued Mr. Gomez, who recently served as Medellin's Mayor. **********Today, the menace is never distant. **********Two hours after the interview, a young woman in blue jeans appeared sobbing at the front gate of the El Colombiano building. It was Azucena Lievano, a television news editor, who had just been released by the traffickers.  'A Coercion of the Press' **********Since November, the cartel has released four journalists, all into the care of Mr. Gomez. Seen as open to dialogue with the traffickers, the newspaper publisher offered last November to open his news columns to traffickers complaining of purported police abuses, in return for the release of the journalists. **********El Colombiano's playing down of the police bombing, first thought to be the work of traffickers here, is symptomatic of the newspaper's nonconfrontational approach to the cartels, readers here said. **********In Bogota, one of the released kidnapping victims said in an interview that the traffickers were successfully implanting a form of unofficial censorship in a country with a long tradition of civilian rule and of press freedom. **********\"I can't use my press freedom,\" the editor said during a pause from laying out pages for a news magazine. \"The hostages have become a coercion of the press.\" **********The intimidating effect on news organizations can be seen daily. **********In a country that is the source of 80 percent of the world's cocaine, most newspapers and television stations have stopped assigning reporters to investigate the cocaine trade. Reporters' bylines no longer appear with articles about narcotics. In reports on narcotics cases in courts, the names of judges and prosecutors are not given for their protection. **********\"It's a censorship based on terror and it's working,\" Luis Gabriel Cano, publisher of El Espectador, a Bogota newspaper historically hostile to the traffickers. In 1987, traffickers killed Mr. Cano's brother, Guillermo. In the last 18 months, traffickers have bombed the newspaper's printing plant and news offices in Bogota, murdered three circulation managers in Medellin, and threatened to \"execute\" the Cano family. **********In September, after a five-month hiatus, El Espectador returned to this city, circulating in semi-clandestine fashion. **********\"No one in Medellin dares to rent us a place to work,\" Mr. Cano said of his fruitless search for an office in this city, Colombia's second largest. In 1990, bombings of studios and radio towers forced two Medellin radio stations to go off the air.  Many Leave the Country **********Fear of violence has forced many journalists to leave Colombia for work in Mexico, in Spain or in Spanish-language news organizations in the United States. **********On Bogota's main thoroughfare, Avenida Septima, the office of the president of the Colombian Association of Journalists stands empty. Late in November, the head of the 5,000-member professional group disappeared after denouncing links between a prominent Medellin lawyer and Pablo Escobar, the fugitive head of the Medellin trafficking cartel. **********\"He is afraid that the Medellin cartel will take reprisals against him,\" Diego Alberto Correa Aristizabal, a television announcer, said of the president, Alejandro Jaramillo. \"We think he must be out of the country.\" **********As many as 100 Colombian journalists are living overseas in \"self exile,\" said Robinson Ricardo Rada Gonzalez, secretary general of the journalists' association.  A Move to Miami **********In the last two years, Colombia has led South America in the number of news employees slain: 7 in 1990 and 19 in 1989. **********To escape the danger, some journalists have tried to maintain a foot in Colombia by moving to Miami. **********\"Here in Miami, I feel very close to Colombia,\" Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist for El Espectador, said in a telephone interview. Ms. Duzan, the frequent target of threats, moved to Miami after gunmen killed her sister, Silvia Margarita, as she was conducting television interviews in rural Colombia last February. **********\"I listen to Colombian radio in the morning and read the Bogota newspapers in the afternoon,\" said Ms. Duzan, who continues to write a column on Colombian politics for El Espectador. \"A lot of politicians come through here and they are much more relaxed for interviews.\" **********A few journalists continue to insist on speaking their minds inside Colombia. In recent weeks, some courageous voices have dared to heap scorn on the Government's offers of light prison terms for traffickers in exchange for their surrender.  'A Pact With the Devil' **********\"This is a pact with the devil,\" Carlos Lemos Simmonds, a columnist for El Tiempo said in an interview. \"This is not submitting the criminals to the law. It is submitting the law to the criminals.\" **********At the rival daily, El Espectador, Ramiro de la Espriella wrote in a recent column: \"Are the drug traffickers really going to turn themselves in? Wouldn't it be more truthful to admit that we are the ones who are surrendering? And in exchange for what?

Yavlinsky, the architect of plans to move toward a market economy, said Friday that the Soviet Union had 240 metric tons in official gold reserves, worth about $3 billion. That is less than one-fifth of what many Western officials estimated.  Decades of Secrecy **********For decades, there has been official secrecy about the gold reserves, which the Kremlin regarded as a strategic asset. In disclosing figures, Mr. Yavlinsky may have hoped to increase pressure on the West to provide debt relief and food aid. **********Many Western officials have hesitated to support vast economic aid to Moscow because they believe the nation has huge official gold reserves, worth perhaps as much as $25 billion. **********The estimate of $3 billion in reserves is very much at the low end of private Western estimates, most of which have exceeded $10 billion. In Washington, a United States Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said the department could not confirm the accuracy of Mr. Yavlinsky's remarks.  No Decisions From U.S. **********The Treasury official said the United States was reviewing the Soviet Union's debt situation but that no decisions had been made. **********Mr. Yavlinsky, in an interview broadcast on Soviet television, said Moscow had sold two-thirds of its gold reserves last year to help finance imports and pay interest on its debt. Some experts suggested that the Soviet Union had pledged gold reserves as collateral on loans, which could help explain why the price of gold did not shift strikingly last year, as it would have if so much gold had been sold. **********The deepening Soviet economic crisis has been underscored by the grain harvest, which is falling below already pessimistic estimates, and by inflation, which is soaring. **********Food supplies are declining at the same time that Government printing presses are working around the clock to print rubles -- a mixture that is fueling inflationary pressures. Fifty- and 100-ruble notes are being put back in circulation; former Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, one of the coup plotters, had ordered them confiscated in a ham-handed effort to fight inflation. In addition, some Soviet officials say the Government will soon begin printing 500-ruble notes for the first time. **********Central bank officials say the amount of money in circulation could surge to 240 billion rubles by January, up from 136 billion at the beginning of this year. Increasing the inflationary pressure, the monetary overhang -- the money people are forced to save because there are not enough goods to buy -- soared to 186 billion rubles on Sept. 1, up 40 percent from 132 billion last Janaury.  Unleashing Inflationary Forces **********All this is unleashing explosive inflationary forces. At present, inflation is estimated to be running at 100 to 250 percent, and some economists say it could soar to 1,000 percent, especially if the fraying trade ties between the republics worsen the supply situation. **********The food situation has alarmed Soviet officials. They note that the wheat harvest is running far below last year's levels. The Government said 148.4 million metric tons were harvested by the fourth week of September, down 27 percent from 203.6 million tons at the comparable time last year. **********Soviet officials say the disappointing harvest underlines the urgency of their appeal for $14.7 billion in emergency food aid for the winter. **********\"We shall not be able to survive the winter without some Western deliveries,\" Leonid Abalkin, a senior economic adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Friday in a speech in New York. **********After forecasting a grain harvest of 190 million tons, many Soviet officials now fear that this year's harvest, scheduled to end in mid-October, will fall below 170 million tons, down sharply from 230 million tons last year. **********Many economists attribute the decline to overall government and economic disarray, as well as poor weather, and the increased difficulties in getting students and soldiers to participate in the harvest. In a nation where statistics cannot always be trusted, some experts suggest that farms are deliberately underreporting their harvest to make it easier for them to hoard grain or to sell it on the black market. **********Compounding the food problem is the system of distributing goods, which is deteriorating rapidly in the wrangle over who has authority over what. One Moscow newspaper cited a K.G.B. document that said St. Petersburg was receiving three-fifths of the food it needed.  Excitement Giving Way to Gloom **********With each passing day, the excitement that resulted from the defeat of last month's coup is giving way to gloom over the economy. In Moscow and other cities, many stores are closed because there is nothing to stock their shelves. In stores that have goods to sell, huge lines fan out onto the sidewalk. **********One factor behind inflation is that banks in the Soviet republics are freely issuing credits to money-losing companies to keep them in business and to meet their payrolls, which has forced the Soviet central bank to print billions of rubles to back those credits. As workers clamor for raises, the Government's budget deficit is expected to soar to close to 300 billion rubles, or 15 percent of the gross national product. **********\"Everyone from miners to teachers wants raises and bonuses,\" Mr. Abalkin said. \"If we don't do it there will be a social explosion. We are printing money on three shifts, on weekends, and still don't have time to finish the work. We are even short of the special paper needed for printing money.\"  Price of Milk Up Sharply **********When milk is available in state stores, it sells for 60 kopecks a liter, a considerable sum in a nation where the average monthly wage for a government worker is about 300 rubles. In the private markets, milk sells for 3 rubles, or five times the rate at the state store. State food stores, where the nation's poor pensioners shop, are finding it increasingly hard to obtain supplies because farmers divert as much produce as possible to private distribution, which pays them far more. **********The surge in inflation will make the conversion to a market economy far more difficult. As happened in Poland, the Soviet Government is likely to have to clamp down on the money supply and raise interest rates to stabilize inflation. But as happened in Poland, that could cause a jolting recession in an already desperate economy. Economic output plunged 12 percent in Poland in 1990, the year the post-Communist Government sought to bring triple-digit inflation under control. **********Most economists predict Soviet industrial output will be down 15 to 20 percent this year from last year. There are numerous factors: government disarray, the initial moves to a market economy, the aging of the nation's capital stock, and the sharp drop in trade with Eastern Europe. **********Many economists say the economic situation will grow worse because of trade frictions between the republics and a lack of economic coordination. **********\"I think that in December, national production will be 50 percent of what it was last December,\" said Anders Aslund, director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and East European Economies. \"It's no longer so easy to get people to obey orders. One has to ask, for example, whether the railway system will continue functioning.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/business/nintendo-to-pay-25-million-in-rebates-on-price-fixing.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Tomasson", "pub_date": "1991-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nintendo to Pay $25 Million In Rebates on Price Fixing", "print_headline": "Nintendo to Pay $25 Million In Rebates on Price Fixing", "body_text": " **********Nintendo has agreed to pay up to $25 million in rebates to buyers of its popular video games and $4.75 million in other costs to settle allegations of price fixing, state and Federal officials announced yesterday in Washington. **********The action follows an unusual joint investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and several states into allegations of antitrust violations by Nintendo. **********Under a consent agreement, in which Nintendo denied any wrongdoing, the company will mail $5 coupons good toward the purchase of any Nintendo game bearing the \"quality seal\" to customers who bought home video games between June 1, 1988, and Dec. 31, 1990.

Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic closed the newspaper for a week after the coup. **********Mr. Linnik's voice was tinged with bitterness as he spoke about the upheaval in his country and the shock waves that reached as far as his apartment and office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Even though he had been a party member since 1977, he said he did not mourn the death of Soviet Communism.

Yeltsin, decided to go ahead with the plan, though Mr. Petrakov seemed to suggest it would not work very well unless the other republics moved simultaneously. **********After Mr. Gorbachev dropped the program, Mr. Petrakov and Mr. Shatalin warned that hyperinflation and political paralysis would be the consequence. **********\"I got the impression that I no longer have any influence,\" Mr. Petrakov told Komsomolskaya Pravda. \"So staying on would be pointless.\" **********He said he would work in a new market institute. \"If they need me, they know where to find me,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-096791.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Jeff Alphin and Don Austen have been promoted to vice president and copywriters at Cliff Freeman & Partners, New York. * Gary Palmer has been promoted to account executive at Taylor-Gordon-Aarons & Co., New York. * Jean Malley has been promoted to vice president and management supervisor at Campbell-Mithun-Esty Advertising, Southfield, Mich. * Syringa Combs has been appointed media buyer at Cramer-Krasselt, Phoenix. * Vonda M.

Gorbachev against political protest rallies. The Gift of Protest **********A snow-dusted paradox was on the move through the city: The people were using the great gift of protest first secured for them by Mr. Gorbachev himself, and they were loudly, publicly protesting what they fervidly saw as his attempt at snatching back the gift. **********\"Democracy ends at that line!\" a marcher shouted, pointing at one of the corridors of waiting troops on the sideline. **********\"It's shameful!\" cried an old man, scrambling to keep pace with the protest parade. \"Not since Stalin's funeral have I seen such a shameful use of troops to control the people.\" **********A grinning marcher wore a sandwich-board sign saying: \"Is Communism done yet? Or is it going to get worse?\" **********A man eyeing the troops all about said: \"We're defenseless. Only our self-discipline will save us.\" **********And it did, by the end of a day that, were Mr. Gorbachev not lately otherwise inclined, the Soviet leader might be entitled to mark as a further sign of popular democracy making its mark on this tortured land. **********In rhythm with their own determined tramping, the marchers shouted slogans in defense of their champion, Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, who has scandalized the Kremlin and elated his ever-growing group of supporters by calling for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation. **********The day's tension and its climactic, ebullient, peaceful rally were much involved with the endless political feuding of Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin. **********But far more, the people who moved through the falling snow were savoring the simple act of public assembly. They took pleasure in circumventing an armada of water cannon, military trucks, and combat troops and police of every description in the center of the city, a stunning gathering assembled by the Kremlin in fear of public disorder. Plugging Routes to Kremlin **********This force plugged all routes to the Kremlin, parked and packed into alleyways and courtyards as if in expectation of the resurrection of Napoleon's army rather than a mere show of Muscovites. **********And rather than march into it, the throngs of civilians marched smartly away from it, as if there were better places to gather for denouncing Mr. Gorbachev than right outside his Kremlin walls. **********\"This is what shows Gorbachev is a loser, all this force,\" said a ruddy-faced woman wearing a big photo over her heart of Mr. Yeltsin and his cocky smile. \"Gorbachev is afraid of us.\" **********The crowd moved by the tens of thousands through the snow down Kalinin Prospekt, their backs to the Kremlin. They maintained a strut, their Russian flags and protest signs bristling colorfully through the large snowflakes soothing the gray city. **********\"Get your Yeltsin news!\" a newspaper dealer cried on the sidewalk, demonstrating the fact that for all his obvious, sometimes ham-handed attempts to diminish the role and power of Mr. Yeltsin, his nemesis, Mr. Gorbachev was only stoking the Yeltsin bandwagon with fresh fuel. **********The crowd, the biggest piece of an ad hoc rally that eventually flooded from three directions into Mayakovsky Square, marched on Kalinin Prospekt up to the city's major Ring Road. There, a traffic policeman was on duty, with none of the wall-to-wall trucks, buses, troops and water cannon to be seen elsewhere. **********The policeman -- a member of a city force from which the Kremlin Interior Ministry took over Moscow law enforcement this week, calling it unreliable -- saw the marchers coming through the snow. He nonchalantly stopped traffic and gave the people the right of way.  Horns Sounded in Solidarity **********Stalled drivers beeped their horns in solidarity. One stuck his hand out his car window, and the traffic cop, walking escort now with the front rank of the marchers, smiled and shook hands. **********More horns sounded. **********\"Yel-tsin! Yel-tsin!\" the strutting throng responded. **********Even as the crowd marched, the Kremlin was putting out the word that Mr. Gorbachev's ban -- openly defied by the insurgent government in city hall -- was not really being violated. A quiet compromise had been worked out with rally leaders, officials announced, in a bit of news that came far too late for the assembled public and its sense of risk in marching. **********Thus did the Kremlin, after inviting the world's wonder by assembling an enormous single-day task force to guard against its own people, try to deal casually with a face-saving issue: What to do about such an impish violation by such a large crowd of Mr. Gorbachev's initial demand that there be no rallies at all in this city for the next three weeks.  Short-Term Denouements **********And thus did this nation maintain its knack for inventing short-term denouements in the midst of its long-term crisis. **********That the crisis remains long-term was implicit in the rally speeches. Democratic legislators drew cheers from the crowd with vows that the Communist Party must once and for all turn back its vast property holdings to the public. But similar cheers were sounded a year ago at a rally, and the party still has its holdings. **********\"The demonstrators were hostages of their situation,\" the television news controlled by Mr. Gorbachev's ministers contended darkly tonight, offering pictures that avoided the sight of the great crowd strutting through the snow. **********As the news was received at home by this skeptical, marching public, roads leading from the city were clogged with military convoys retreating from the Kremlin. **********The last words at the rally were a mention of how long and strange a day the troops had to put in. \"Well, we forgive them,\" said a speaker and the rally cheered that, too."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/10/business/the-media-business-maxwell-son-assets-are-frozen.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1991-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maxwell Son Assets Are Frozen", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Maxwell Son Assets Are Frozen", "body_text": " **********LONDON, Tuesday, Dec. 10 -- **********A judge has imposed a freeze on the assets of Kevin Maxwell, the younger son of Robert Maxwell, of up to $:450 million ($815 million), marking one of the first legal actions taken against the sons since the Maxwell publishing empire started unraveling. **********The freeze, imposed on Sunday, suggests that Kevin Maxwell, who is 32 years old and had the leading role in running the Maxwell empire after his father's mysterious death, is under greater suspicion than his older brother, Ian, of having moved assets out of employee pension funds and the two main public companies in the empire: the Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. and the Maxwell Communication Corporation. **********In addition, the court also ordered both Kevin and Ian Maxwell to surrender their passports, but a judge early today agreed to allow Kevin Maxwell to leave Britain after Mr. Maxwell argued that he had to fly to New York for crucial talks to save The Daily News. 'Going to New York' **********\"I am going to New York,\" Mr. Maxwell said, when he emerged from the court building after the judge's ruling. \"I will be working on the reorganization plan for the Daily News.\" Last week, The Daily News sought bankruptcy protection from creditors after its owner, one of the Maxwell family's private holding companies, sought similar court protection in Britain. A second holding company in the Maxwell publishing empire sought such protection. Most of the Maxwell holdings are now expected to be sold. The borrowings or transfers are believed at this point to total at least $:763 million ($1.38 billion). They are believed to have been taken as the result of a scheme masterminded by a frantic Robert Maxwell in the four or five months before his Nov. 5 death at sea, according to bankers, advisers to the Maxwells, executives of the empire and Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, the accounting firm. Coopers conducted a special investigation after Mr. Maxwell was found dead in the water near his yacht off the Canary Islands. Coopers was assisted by N. M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd., a British investment bank. **********Two of the main private holding companies, Headington Investments Ltd. and Robert Maxwell Group P.L.C., filed for the British equivalent of bankruptcy last Thursday. Liquidator Appointed **********A final figure on what is missing will not be known until the current investigations are completed. But The Daily News in New York is believed to have been one of the recipients of the money. **********The court also appointed a provisional liquidator to take control of Bishopsgate Investment Management, a company owned by the Maxwell family that is believed to have been at the heart of the scandal. Two directors of Bishopsgate requested the liquidator be appointed. Regulators and trustees of at least one of the pension funds supported the request. **********The appointment will make it legally easier for the pension funds to try to trace and secure the hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that have been taken from them. It is not yet known what these latest developments mean for The Daily News's chances for survival. Can't Leave Britain **********Under the court order issued Sunday night, Kevin and Ian Maxwell were prohibited from leaving Britain until they provided affidavits to the provisional liquidator that detail their personal assets and provide any information they might have that will help secure the assets. They were given a week to do it. **********But at the hearing early today, the lawyer for Kevin Maxwell asked the judge to allow his client to go to New York, arguing that there was no reason to suspect his client would abscond. He added that his client would give an accounting of his personal assets before leaving. The lawyer also said Mr. Maxwell's wife was prepared to surrender her passport, which the judge did not request. But the judge said Mr. Maxwell must return no later than Firday evening and re-surrender his passport **********Bishopsgate managed about half of five pension funds of public and private companies in the Maxwell empire, whose value totaled nearly $:800 million ($1.45 billion), according to the Investment Management Regulatory Organization, a British regulator. **********At this point, assets worth about $:426 million ($771.5 million) are believed to have been taken from the pension funds. At least $:337 million ($610.3 million) in cash and securities is believed to have been borrowed or transferred from Mirror Group and Maxwell Communication themselves. Cash Flow Problems **********The Mirror Group, one of Britain's leading newspaper publishers, has discovered that at least an additional $:97 million ($175.7 million) is missing from the company. Bankers said the Mirror Group was suffering severe cash flow problems. The company was negotiating with banks today to try to obtain a short-term loan of at least $:35 million ($63.4 million) to see it through the crisis, bankers said. **********In a statement issued Monday night, Ernest Burrington, the Mirror Group's chairman, described the talks as \"very constructive,\" which seemed to imply that the package had not yet been signed. **********Another potential bidder for the Mirror Group emerged when Lonrho P.L.C., the conglomerate whose chief executive is Roland W. Rowland, said it might be interested. Others who declared an interest were an employee group and Pearson P.L.C., a diversified publishing company. **********Assets of the pension funds appear to have been taken by funneling them through a series of investment firms owned by Robert Maxwell, who also oversaw the pension funds. His sons, Kevin and Ian, were also trustees of some of the pension funds and some of the investment firms at various times. **********In May, Mr. Maxwell had ordered the stock portfolio of the pension funds managed by Bishopsgate to be liquidated, which was not illegal in itself, said someone close to the Coopers & Lybrand team that investigated the empire, confirming such reports in British newspapers. \"But the proceeds did not go back to the pension funds, which may be illegal if it is not found,\" the person said. **********He also said that Larry Trachtenberg, who was a director or an executive of some of the investment firms, had told the Coopers team that Mr. Maxwell had ordered him in June to transfer shares belonging to the pension funds into Mr. Maxwell's personal safe. The shares had a value of about $:100 million, or about $160 million at then-prevailing exchange rate. \"It wasn't illegal but they weren't there after his death,\" the person close to the Coopers team said. \"They are part of the assets unaccounted for.\" **********The transfer of the money from Bishopsgate required the signature of at least two of the firm's six directors, who had included Mr. Maxwell, Kevin and Ian Maxwell, Trevor Cook, Ron Woods and Mr. Trachtenberg. Mr. Trachtenberg, an American who had joined the board in September, and the Maxwell brothers resigned last week. **********The Mirror Group has said that the signatures of Mr. Maxwell and at least two other directors have been found on documents authorizing pension fund assets to the private companies but has declined to say whether other signatures were the brothers'. **********The Financial Times said last week that three Mirror Group directors, whom it did not name, had said that the brothers had signed some of the transfer papers. Another British newspaper, The Guardian, said it had been told that Kevin Maxwell's signature was on a document authorizing one such transaction. It quoted two people -- \"one on each side of the deal\" -- but did not name them. **********Attempts to reach the brothers through the Mirror Group and Maxwell Communication have been unsuccessful. A call to Kevin Maxwell's lawyer was not returned. **********There are other signs that one or both of the brothers have been involved in taking assets from the company in actions that were possibly illegal or of questionable impropriety. **********Maxwell Communication has disclosed that some of its shares in Berlitz International are missing. The discovery is threatening to delay and could conceivably scuttle the completion of Maxwell Communication's $265 million sale of a 56 percent stake in Berlitz to the Fukutake Publishing Company of Japan, depriving heavily indebted Maxwell Communication of badly needed cash. Bank Confirms Deal **********Confirming reports in British newpspapers, a spokesman for the Swiss Volksbank, said that it had received an undisclosed number of Berlitz shares last month -- after Mr. Maxwell's death -- as collateral for a loan to the Robert Maxwell Group. When asked who had authorized the deal, the bank would only say \"executives of Robert Maxwell Group,\" which means it could have been Kevin or Ian Maxwell. **********Shearson Lehman Brothers, the American brokerage, has acknowledged that on Nov. 6 it took possession of 1.9 million Berlitz shares, or a 9.9 percent stake in Berlitz. What appears to have been a Bishopsgate subsidiary provided the shares as collateral for a loan that was not repaid. But the deal was struck before Mr. Maxwell's death, and Shearson declined to say who had signed the documents. **********Commercial and investment banks are believed to have been given a total of $:100 million to $:120 million ($181.1 million to $217.3 million) in shares that came from the pension funds, the Mirror Group or Maxwell Communication, according to the person close to the special investigation. Another person involved in the investigation confirmed that estimate. They said the investigation indicated that those that had received the shares included British, American, French and Swiss banks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/business/company-news-la-quinta-accepts-slate-of-nominees.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "La Quinta Accepts Slate of Nominees", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; La Quinta Accepts Slate of Nominees", "body_text": " **********La Quinta Motor Inns Inc. has agreed to nominate five directors proposed by dissident shareholders who include a group led by members of the Bass family of Fort Worth, the company said.

In addition, oil-industry officials said, it will force Mexico to import some kinds of gasoline until new refining capacity can be built. **********But the action will abruptly eliminate what environmentalists have long considered one of the worst sources of pollution in the mountain-ringed capital, which is now suffering under one of the most dangerous periods of contaminated air in its history. Mr. Salinas declared that the giant refinery would be replaced by public parks and other green spaces to help head off a still graver environmental crisis.  Trees Instead of Pipelines **********\"The Government is prepared to impose upon itself the most severe measures to protect public health and to respond to social demands,\" Mr. Salinas said, announcing the decision at a ceremony marking the 53d anniversary of the nationalization of Mexico's oil industry, \"Let's plant trees where today there is nothing but pipelines.\" **********The announcement came after weeks of growing public concern about the health effects of recent pollution levels, which have reached nearly four times maximum limits established by the World Health Organization for major pollutants. It reflected the intense political pressure that the Government has felt as it has tried to cope with the visibly deteriorating air quality in the city, which is home to roughly 15 million people, without bringing its vital industries to a halt. **********In comments to reporters recently, a senior medical official of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, which operates most of the country's public health installations, estimated that the number of patients treated for respiratory illnesses at public hospitals had risen by as much as 20 percent in recent months, confirming the concerns of pediatricians and other doctors who have described a sharp increase in such cases.  More Hospital Patients **********In published interviews, officials of the National Chamber of Hospitals have said the increase in respiratory patients at private hospitals has been even more pronounced, reaching as much as 30 percent over previous levels. And medical authorities from the public and private sector alike described particular problems among children, whose respiratory systems, sinuses and ears are considered more likely to suffer long-term damage from heavy pollution. **********The federal Government, which has consistently resisted providing any formal statistical analysis of the relationship between the city's high pollution levels and health problems, quickly moved to discount such estimates, arguing that there is no proven correlation between respiratory illness and pollution. **********But the scale of the ecological crisis, which has left even healthy adults with nosebleeds, sore throats and stinging eyes, has forced the Government to confront difficult political trade-offs between economic development and public health. **********The director of the state-run energy monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, said today that the giant Mexico City refinery, which opened in 1933, had served as the \"backbone of production and distribution of fuels\" for the capital, and that extensive studies were made in an effort to keep it open at lower levels of emissions. The refinery accounted for roughly 7 percent of overall national refining capacity, oil officials said. **********But the director, Francisco Rojas, said that Government officials had ultimately concluded that the refinery, which was named in honor of the date on which the oil industry was nationalized in 1938, should be shut down immediately with the exception of minor storage and distribution installations that will be preserved. **********Officials of the energy monopoly, which is commonly known as Pemex, said the refinery currently employed 5,429 workers, 3,206 of whom were directly involved in the refining process. But they said that no workers would be laid off as a result of today's decision and that the company would speed plans to build a new, 300,000-barrel-a-day refinery outside the capital region. **********Although the highest pollution levels in Mexico City are usually associated with thermal inversion layers caused by cold, stagnant weather in late January and early February, ecologists warn that still higher concentrations may lie ahead this year as warming air, sunlight and vehicle exhaust combine to produce ozone, one of the city's most intractable pollutants. **********Government officials have consistently maintained that they are doing all that is possible to reverse the growth of pollution in the capital area. Over the last year, city and federal officials have adopted a broad series of antipollution measures, ranging from tough new restrictions on automobile traffic to replacement of the city's entire bus fleet. They have also promised to bring the city's industrial activity to a halt if pollution levels become intolerably high. **********But labor and industrial leaders have resisted attempts to impose more drastic antipollution measures. And a combination of adverse weather conditions and high continued emissions has produced high daily concentrations of pollutants that some scientists have warned could threaten the city with a so-called \"killing fog.\" **********\"If drastic measures are not taken immediately to reduce the pollution at the source, with satisfactory results, we will be on the brink of an ecological catastrophe,\" declared a recent statement by the Group of 100, an organization of prominent Mexican artists and intellectuals that has taken a leading role in pressing the Goverment to protect the environment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/all-about-batteries-keeping-a-gadget-mad-nation-charged-up-and-safe.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1991-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Batteries; Keeping a Gadget-Mad Nation Charged Up -- and Safe", "print_headline": "All About/Batteries; Keeping a Gadget-Mad Nation Charged Up -- and Safe", "body_text": " **********From boom boxes to camcorders, Walkmen to cordless drills, portable power means batteries -- lots and lots of them. Americans now consume 2.7 billion of these household batteries a year. Most end up as trash in landfills and incinerators. **********But many environmentalists and governmental officials are concerned that the metals used in batteries will get into drinking-water supplies as landfills leak or as incinerator-stack emissions fall to the ground. All dry-cell batteries -- different from car batteries, which have a liquid electrolyte -- store electricity through chemical reactions that usually involve two different and often toxic metals. **********According to a draft report prepared earlier this year by the Environmental Protection Agency, household batteries account for 52 percent of the cadmium and 88 percent of the mercury found in trash, though less than 1 percent of all municipal solid waste by weight. Small amounts of the metals, if ingested, can damage the nervous system or increase the risk of cancer. **********As a result, several states, including Connecticut, have recently passed laws requiring that batteries containing cadmium be easily removable from appliances for disposal. Other legislation, much calling for the recycling of materials in batteries, is pending in several states. Several dozen communities, including some in New York, have begun programs to separate batteries from other trash for reclamation. **********The initiatives could shift the balance of power from single-use batteries to rechargeables. Not only can they be used and recharged about 300 to 1,000 times, but their manufacturers seem more agreeable to recycling. **********Single-use batteries are the largest category by far of the $3.3 billion battery market, which is estimated to be growing 4 percent to 5 percent a year. Two companies -- Duracell International Inc., once a unit of the Union Carbide Corporation, and Eveready, a unit of the Raltson-Purina Company -- account for 80 percent of the sector. A number of other companies like Ray-O-Vac, Kodak, Panasonic, Sony and General Electric, fight for the remaining share. **********The environmental issue has made rechargeables the fastest-growing market segment, according to industry executives. The largest producer is Gates Energy Products, a unit of the Denver-based Gates Corporation, a rubber products company. Its batteries are sold under dozens of names by a number of retailers including Radio Shack. Its own brand is Millennium. Gates said the market for rechargeables is about $330 million a year, or 10 percent of the overall market. **********'Green' Batteries  Environmentalists Push Rechargeables **********The makers of single-use batteries, like Duracell and Eveready, say they have defused environmental concerns by removing all but a tiny fraction of mercury from their best-selling alkaline batteries. **********\"The ingredient of concern is mercury and all the battery companies have done a lot to remove it from their products,\" said James J. Donahue, Jr., a spokesman for Duracell. **********Even so, environmentalists say that using batteries once and throwing them away adds to the trash that must be disposed of and contributes to the depletion of the resources that go into them. **********\"Based on first principles, you would argue for rechargeables,\" said Richard Denison, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"One rechargeable can replace hundreds of disposables.\" **********Popular guides for environmentally correct consumer behavior, like \"50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth,\" published by Earth Works Press in Berkeley, Calif., typically recommend rechargeable batteries. The E.P.A. recommends using them in small appliances \"whenever possible.\" **********Producers of single-use cells note that rechargeables tend to lose their charge much faster on the shelf and can hold only about a quarter the power of an alkaline cell of equal size. Prices for rechargeables are two to four times higher than for single-use cells. **********The Cadmium Question  Lingering Problems With Toxic Metals **********The most popular type of rechargeable battery has environmental problems of its own. It is the nickel-cadmium battery found in \"cordless\" appliances that stay plugged in when not in use. Each year, millions of portable vacuum cleaners, camcorders, shavers, electric drills and flashlights are sold with rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries.  Most of them are sealed in the appliances at least in part to prevent users from trying to replace failed batteries with conventional ones. Attempting to recharge single-use batteries can cause them to swell up, leak, or even explode. **********This means that each year tens of thousands of rechargeable batteries, containing an estimated 1,200 tons of toxic cadmium, are going into landfills and incinerators as the appliances are discarded. **********To prevent this, three states, Connecticut, Minnesota and Vermont, have passed laws requiring that the batteries be easily removable so they can be discarded separately when they or the appliance wear out. More states are expected to follow with similar rules. The intent is to induce customers to separate the nickel-cadmium units from other batteries so the toxic materials can be recycled. **********The makers of nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries have broken away from a broad industry group, the Battery Producers Alliance, to form the Portable Rechargeable Battery Association. \"Our initial focus is to promote the recycling of nickel-cadmium batteries,\" said Norm England, the new group's executive director. \"We want to do pilot projects so we can figure out the economics\" of recycling. **********Since there are no facilities in this country to recover cadmium from batteries, initially they will have to be shipped overseas. And any group collecting batteries in quantity risks coming under E.P.A. hazardous-waste rules, which greatly increases costs. **********As a result the single-use battery producers are cool to recycling efforts. Mr. Donahue said the industry would support recycling if it were economically practical. But the value of the materials, like zinc and manganese, is not high enough to cover the collection and processing costs. \"In the absence of recycling, there is no better method of disposal than household trash,\" Mr. Donahue said. **********A Hydride Substitute It Has Fewer Uses And Costs More **********Putting aside their current enthusiasm for recycling, some makers of rechargeable batteries have tacitly acknowledged that problems associated with cadmium will probably limit the product's use in the future. So they are developing new batteries that use various metal hydrides instead. **********The new battery favored by many manufacturers has many of the same characteristics as nickel-cadmium, without the disposal problem. But its differences may limit its application. **********For example, the hydride battery can hold twice as much power per unit as standard nickel-cadmium, but it discharges in storage at twice the rate. According to Gates, which is developing a hydride substitute, a fully charged hydride battery would lose its charge after standing for two months. The new batteries are also likely to be more expensive than nickel-cadmium batteries, at least when first released. **********The hydride battery also cannot put out power as fast as nickel-cadmium, so it probably will not be suitable for power tools and appliances that drain batteries rapidly. At the moment, that leaves only nickel-cadmium and small, sealed lead-acid batteries for those applications. SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT, AND MONEY **********How do the costs of using rechargeable batteries stack up against those for their disposable counterparts? The difference can be quite dramatic, according to a recent study. **********The analysis -- conducted at Carnegie-Mellon University and cited in the World Wildlife Fund's study \"Getting at the Source: Strategies for Reducing Municipal Solid Waste\"-- assumed that a cassette player was operated for two hours a day over a three-year period using four batteries. It also assumed alkaline batteries would last five hours, and that the nickel cadmium rechargeables would last two hours. **********After three years the alkaline-battery user would have gone through 876 cells at a cost of $657. The four original rechargeable batteries would still be in use, so that total battery purchase cost was estimated at $11. **********But the rechargeable user faces costs for the recharger and the power consumed in recharging. The study estimated the cost of the recharger at $10 and the power cost for 1,095 recharges at $5. The total cost of rechargeables would be $26, or a savings of $631. **********The environmental savings are just as impressive, according to the study. The disposable batteries would pile up 24,100 grams of trash, including 105 grams of toxic mercury, compared with 90 grams of waste from the rechargeables. The rechargeables would add 16 grams of toxic cadmium to the environment, the study concluded."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/business/natural-gas-issues-lead-retreat-in-stock-market.html": {"writer_name": "H.

In all, 414 Big Board issues advanced and 1,156 declined. **********By far the largest price drop was posted by Columbia Gas System, which announced it was omitting a dividend payment and was considering bankruptcy. Columbia Gas rallied late in the session and closed down 13 3/4, at 20 3/4. It was the most active Big Board issue, on a turnover of 4.4 million shares. Dow Utility Average Falls **********Columbia's woes depressed other natural gas stocks. Consolidated Natural Gas fell 1 3/4, to 39 1/2; Panhandle Eastern, 1 1/8, to 11 1/4; Transco Energy, 1, to 32 3/8. The combined losses caused the Dow Jones utility average, which is usually linked to interest rate trends, to drop by 9.87, to 197.25, its lowest level since October. **********The Dow industrial average fell 31.31, to 2,955.50; the Standard & Poor's index of 500 shares lost 3.50, at 375.09; the Big Board's composite index declined 1.85, to 205.78; the Nasdaq composite dropped 6.23, to 485.36; the American Stock Exchange's Market Value Index fell 2.67, to 364.73. **********\"The market was a bit shaky on overnight weakness in Tokyo stocks and subsequent follow-through selling in London and concern about this Friday's 'triple witching hour' when the news about Columbia Gas hit the screens,\" said William M. LeFevre, senior vice president for market strategy at Tucker Anthony Inc.  An Exaggerated Effect **********\"While the relatively light volume in a weak market was a somewhat positive, it caused a handful of issues to have an exaggerated effect on the averages,\" Mr. LeFevre said. \"For example, only three of the 15 stocks in the Dow utility average are natural gas companies, but we can see what clout the three -- Columbia, Consolidated and Panhandle -- had on the Dow utility average.\" **********The triple witching hour occurs on the third Friday each June, September, December and March. That is the expiration date for the current S.& P. 500 futures, options on these futures and options on individual stocks. In the past such expiration days have caused severe price volatility in a few hours. **********Yesterday, Standard & Poor's introduced a new index, based on 400 stocks with middle-range capitalization. The index moved between 124.95 and 123.34 and closed at 123.54. **********In any event, the program traders who use these futures and options as prime operating tools were not much in evidence yesterday. According to Birinyi Associates, there was only one major buy program and two sell programs during the session. The programs lasted for a total of 39 minutes, and their net effect was to reduce the Dow industrial average by 5.15 points.  Semiconductor Stocks Decline **********While natural gas stocks dominated market news, the semiconductor sector continued to be buffeted. International Rectifier, for one, plunged 5 5/8, to 16 1/2, and was the Big Board's third-most-active issue, on a turnover of 2.3 million shares. Another weak issue in this group was Intel, which fell a further point, to 47 1/2, in over-the-counter trading . **********Also weighing on the market was an increasing number of brokerage houses that are paring their estimates of corporate earnings for 1991 and next year. **********Estimates of lower earnings were blamed for Procter & Gamble's falling 2 3/8, to 81, on a volume of 1.5 million shares, which placed it seventh on the Big Board list of 10 most active issues. The same factor caused Pepsico, the second most active, on 3.5 million shares, to slip 1/2, to 29 7/8."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-062691.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Christopher T.

Plant Closing", "body_text": " **********By not announcing which of two big-car assembly plants here and in Ypsilanti, Mich., it would close, the General Motors Corporation today put the lives of 3,400 workers here in limbo. **********In saying only that the company intends to close in the next few years 21 assembly, engine and parts plants, Robert C. Stempel, chairman and chief executive of the No. 1 auto maker, set off a likely tug-of-war between the company, the union and local politicians as a decision is reached on which plants should be closed. **********\"That work is still ahead of us,\" Mr. Stemple said, predicting that the transition would occur next year. **********But one thing is clear in this suburban city east of Fort Worth: Only one plant -- either the one here or the Ypsilanti plant, known as Willow Run, near Ann Arbor -- will be closed in the biggest retrenchment ever for General Motors. **********At the Arlington plant, some workers challenged Mr. Stempel's promise that the plants would not be played off against each another to force the deepest possible concessions. But most workers boasted of their productivity. **********\"Dealers will tell you they'd rather have an Arlington car than a Willow Run car,\" said Annette Morrow, a seat builder and trimmer who has worked 15 years for G.M. \"Willow Run labor is too militant and they have more salaried people there than we do,\" she said, referring to the Michigan plant. **********Both plants build big cars, like the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Roadmaster. The decision on which to close will come down to which plant can make a better case for cutting costs and improving G.M.'s poor efficiency record so that the maker's cars can be priced more competitively. **********The Michigan plant has lower costs for parts shipments, especially heavy engines and transmissions, compared with the Texas site because of its location near the heart of America's auto-making nerve center and G.M.'s North American supplier network. Yet the Texas plant is closer to suppliers of smaller parts, like wiring harnesses, door assemblies and body trim made in northern Mexico. **********Arlington workers and executives once bragged that the quality of their work was one of the highest of any plant in the G.M. empire, but Mr. Stempel said today that that was no longer an issue. \"The differences are so slight\" now in quality levels among all G.M. plants, he said. **********Workers at the G.M. plant here were told last week by their manager, Art Hester, and a senior union official, Mike Seiler, not to expect a decision today from Mr. Stempel. Many were stunned and angered by a report today in The Detroit Free Press that the decision to close the Arlington plant had already been made. **********But after Mr. Stempel's remarks to reporters, many renewed their hopes that their plant would prevail in a competition with Willow Run.  Action by Union **********G.M.'s announcement today came as members of United Automobile Workers union Local 276 here voted to give their leaders a virtual blank check to bargain for whatever terms are needed to keep the Arlington plant in business. **********\"We need a good vote on this to give us the teeth to go in and negotiate,\" said Dave Perdue, president of the U.A.W. local. \"I feel like we'll win.\" **********One proposal outlined by the union was to add a third shift at the plant by moving to a four-day workweek of 10-hour shifts for its members. Current shifts are eight hours, five days a week. The change could open jobs for workers transferred from the Michigan plant, Mr. Perdue said. **********Mr. Perdue said the union was not pressured into the concession by Mr.  Hester. \"He just lays the situation out on the table, and it's up to us to make some decisions,\" he said. **********Walter Mays, 45, said the schedule change would help overcome the Arlington plant's smaller production capacity and higher freight costs compared with Willow Run's.  Making a Case **********The workers were told last week that Arlington managers would make their case before G.M. executives in Detroit during the week of Jan. 8, with Willow Run to follow a week later. A decision is expected before Feb. 1. **********Mr. Mays was among those who were skeptical about Mr. Stempel's promise that the two plants were not being \"whipsawed,\" as he put it. **********\"I've seen this before,\" Mr. Mays said of the schedule changes that his union leaders had endorsed. \"Six years ago, we were told to vote in the team concept, or the plant would close,\" he said, referring to a way of reorganizing the work force. \"We did, by 86 percent. Willow Run didn't, but they stayed open. I think it's another game to see what they can get. Their decision, whatever it is, has already been made.\"  Another Blow **********A shutdown of the sprawling, 38-year-old plant here would be yet another blow for the economy of the Fort Worth region, which, with one-third the population of Dallas, has been battered by plant closings and job cutbacks all year. **********Just over a year ago, the Fort Worth area had one of the lowest jobless rates in Texas, at 4.4 percent. But jarring cutbacks in Pentagon budgets, which had an impact on a General Dynamics plant here; a slumping local economy, and rising manufacturing layoffs pushed unemployment to 7.2 percent in October. **********The Pentagon canceled development of the Navy A-12 attack plane in January. And last summer it said that 7,000 jobs would be lost when the nearby Carswell Air Force Base, home to aging B-52 bombers, would be closed. **********Those cutbacks knocked nearly 5 percent from the Fort Worth-Arlington economic base, and the loss of the G.M. plant \"would blow away another point and a half,\" said Don C. Reynolds, a Fort Worth economist and former head of the county's economic development commission. **********Bernard L. Weinstein, another local economist, said the General Motors plant, with a 1990 payroll of $121.5 million and hourly wages ranging between $15 and $25, contributes between $400 million and $500 million in purchasing power to the local economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/business/credit-markets-treasury-issues-narrowly-mixed.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Issues Narrowly Mixed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Issues Narrowly Mixed", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday, a session highlighted by an auction of $11.5 billion of new two-year notes. **********Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 7.15 percent, up substantially from the 6.87 percent average rate at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 20. **********Dealers said the yield at the auction was attractive relative to the Federal Reserve Board's 6 percent target for the overnight Federal funds rate.
