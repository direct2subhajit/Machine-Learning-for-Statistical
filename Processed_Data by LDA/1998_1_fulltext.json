For Sun, work stations are a mainstay, generating $3.5 billion in revenue last year, according to an estimate by the International Data Corporation, a research concern. **********The entire work station business is under pressure from the recent inroads made by high-end personal computers, using the Intel Corporation's most powerful microchips and the Microsoft Corporation's industrial-strength operating system, Windows NT. **********In 1997, the sales of PC work stations running Windows NT grew 87 percent, to an estimated $6 billion, according to IDC. By contrast, sales of traditional work stations running Unix operating system, produced by companies including Sun and Hewlett-Packard, declined about 12 percent, to $9.8 billion in 1997. **********''With this announcement, Sun is responding very aggressively to the price challenge,'' said Tom Copeland, a work station analyst for IDC. **********Sun contended that its new lower-cost models, called Darwin, with prices starting at $2,995, were cheaper than comparably powered work stations made by PC makers, like Compaq. **********Sun, analysts say, is also delivering improved graphics capability in its new high-end work stations, the Ultra 60 series, at prices well below those offered by Silicon Graphics Inc., a leading supplier of machines for movie special effects and computer-generated animation. **********Sun has been able to cut the prices on its work stations while increasing their performance by revamping its product design and manufacturing in the last year, explained Ed Zander, the executive in charge of Sun's hardware business. It is now using many PC industry-standard parts in its machines, rather than design its own, while focusing time and investment on advancing its own technology -- Sun's Ultrasparc microchip and Solaris Unix operating system. **********Other work station producers, like Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. have all decided recently to offer work stations running on Intel chips and Windows NT, as well as offering traditional Unix-based machines. **********''Sun is now the only vendor standing out against the Windows NT work station,'' said Peter Ffoulkes, an industry analyst for Dataquest, a research firm. ''And that is because Sun's management is totally committed to the concept that it is a technology company and not a reseller of other people's technology.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/26/business/international-business-new-europe-importing-ways-wall-st-for-investment-firms.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1998-12-26", "snippet": "American investment banks are competing to export more of Wall Street's ways to Europe as profit expectations heighten with imminent introduction of the euro; many financial specialists are forecasting profound changes in way continental European ...", "word_count": 1617, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: THE NEW EUROPE -- Importing the Ways of Wall St.; For Investment Firms, Euro Spells Opportunity", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: THE NEW EUROPE -- Importing the Ways of Wall St.; For Investment Firms, Euro Spells Opportunity", "body_text": " **********It has all the trappings of a gold rush: the lure of riches, the frisson of risk, the headlong dash to stake the claims. **********The euro, Europe's single currency, makes its debut in just a week, creating a vast currency zone from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean. And to listen to the most optimistic of those seeking profit there, the currency's birth will unlock a mother lode of wealth that has set American investment banks competing to export more of Wall Street's ways to continental Europe. **********While these great expectations may be overblown, there is no doubt that for investors and fund managers, the euro's arrival one week from now will mean an unparalleled transformation. Trading in 11 separate currencies will disappear, creating a single financial bloc with an economic output greater than that of the United States. Many financial specialists forecast profound changes in the way continental European markets operate -- and increasing pressure on Europeans to emulate the ways of Wall Street. **********''There's this wall of money waiting to come into the market,'' said Jeremy Isaacs, head of European equity business at the Lehman Brothers office here. ''Do I think European investors are going to become more like U.S. investors? The answer is: absolutely.'' **********Of course, it is not as if continental European countries have been slouches in positioning themselves for the coming euro zone: Think only of megamergers like DaimlerChrysler, the Deutsche Bank takeover of Bankers Trust or the pharmaceutical fusion of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc. **********And the world's economic spiral and low growth forecasts for Europe as a whole have muted some of the more bullish voices forecasting a euro bonanza. ''I don't think you are going to have a revolution,'' Mr. Isaacs said. **********''You are going to have an evolution,'' he said. ''The question is when, not if.'' **********Euro coins and notes will not be introduced for two more years, but all transactions between banks in the 11 participating countries and all operations involving equities and bonds will be denominated in euros starting next week. With only one currency in play, European companies will increasingly be evaluated by equity investors and fund managers across a broad field of competition where pricing and performance are no longer disguised by national currencies or local scales of importance. **********The euro zone ''redefines what is a blue chip,'' said David Bowers, European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, arguing that, for instance, a company regarded as a heavyweight in one of the 11 countries would not necessarily make it into a euro index of top companies. **********In addition, 11 separate government bond markets will be replaced by a single euro debt market in which the divergent yields of the past will be replaced by far more subtle calculations of razor-thin spreads between, say, euro-denominated bonds issued by Italy and euro bonds issued by Germany. **********Cross-border acquisitions will be simplified by the euro, which will eliminate currency risk within the zone because it will have an immutable value against national currencies until they are phased out altogether in the year 2002. **********Insurance companies in the 11 euro countries alone have around $1 trillion invested in their own governments' bonds, according to Crispin Southgate, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Pension funds have a further $350 billion in the same bonds. **********Both those amounts are set to mushroom as fund managers look for higher yields in the low-interest euro zone and strapped governments place an ever-larger part of the burden for pension provision on private citizens. **********These prospects have sharpened competition among the big American investment banks that have their European headquarters here and see themselves as best placed to deploy expertise won in the United States. That has set alarm bells ringing for big European institutions, which have been scrambling to acquire some of the same skills -- and the same reach -- as the introduction of the euro nears. **********''One of the things we have been seeing in the mergers in European banking groups is European banks trying to get the critical mass and the expertise to compete globally,'' said Madeleine Hall, a European fund manager at Schroders. **********They have not always been successful. For all its size, the giant UBS A.G., born of Union Bank of Switzerland's merger with the Swiss Bank Corporation, lost out badly in this year's meltdown of emerging and speculative markets. **********Still, big European banks such as Paribas, Deutsche Bank, ABN-Amro and Barclays are all hoping to translate strong local ties and cultural affiliations into thriving business. ''These firms are pretty powerful in their own markets,'' said Robert Morris, a managing director at Barclay Capital. While American banks would seek to expand corporate bond and other business in Europe, he added, ''it doesn't mean to say that they are quickly going to steal the market.'' **********The competition is particularly fierce in the creation of new indices for bonds denominated in euros -- a dry-sounding business redolent of number-crunching that will still play a central role both in the evaluation of fund managers' performance in a changing market-place and, more gradually, in the way businesses raise money to finance their operations. **********In the last year, American financial institutions including Morgan Stanley Capital International, Salomon Smith Barney, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Bear, Stearns and J. P. Morgan have devised eurobond indices in anticipation of a new, performance driven approach to investment in the 11 euro countries. **********By contrast, only Barclays among the European banks has devised a similar index, and that one is narrowly based on government bond performance. In the last 18 months, the overall number of benchmarks has risen to 14 from two -- a proliferation some bankers view as excessive. Such has been the rush to new indices that 1998 has become known as the year of ''the battle of the benchmarks.'' **********The institutions offering benchmarks are hoping not only for the adoption of their indices as gauges for managers' performance but also for the business that comes with it. ''What distinguishes one index provider from another is the reach of services,'' said Richard Pagan of Salomon Smith Barney. **********Most of the new euro indices are now heavily weighted toward government bonds because corporate-bond issuance, though it has grown rapidly over the last year, is still only a fraction of the United States level. **********Government bonds in Lehman Brothers' United States aggregate bond index, for example, take up 47 percent of the index while corporate debt accounts for 21 percent. The same bank's euro bond index is composed of 67 percent government and 12 percent corporate debt. **********According to Anant Patel, a managing director at Bear, Stearns, the government bond market in the euro zone is currently worth some 2.25 trillion euros -- more than $2.6 trillion -- compared with a corporate bond market now valued at some 690 billion euros, roughly $800 billion. **********The expectation among fund managers is that those proportions will change radically as continental European banks re-examine corporate loans and companies wean themselves away from reliance on banks for financing. **********At present, said Merrill Lynch's Mr. Southgate, 90 percent of corporate financing in continental Europe is provided by bank loans, compared with 50 percent in the United States. By some estimates, fewer than 10 percent of continental Europe's 1,700 investment-grade companies -- many of them in Germany -- have issued public debt. That is set to change. **********''European banks are looking more closely at how much money they make,'' said David Munves, credit market strategist at Lehman Brothers. ''Corporate loans are coming under scrutiny, due to shareholder value in general.'' **********''It's a major opportunity for new index providers,'' he said. **********One indication of the likely shift toward corporate issuance is the prospect of stepped-up activity by ratings agencies -- still an unfamiliar concept to many European companies. **********Eric de Bodard, managing director for corporate finance in Europe at Moody's Investor Services, said the number of European companies to which Moody's ratings had been assigned grew by 100 to more than 300 in 1998. **********''All the signs point to at least as active a year'' in 1999, he said. ''Investors are going to be looking for more yield and are going to diversify their portfolios without foreign exchange risk.'' **********Indeed, said Mr. Patel at Bear, Stearns, with the advent of a single currency for financial transactions, the nature of portfolio management will change. **********''Traditionally in Europe, the way in which portfolio managers have been able to deliver performance is to take views on relative currency performance and the performance of spread relationships between markets,'' he said. **********With the arrival of the euro, though, ''the currency component will disappear, which was one of the biggest components,'' while interest rate spreads will shrivel. ''And now all of a sudden, you ask the question: where do I get value enhancement?'' **********The result, he said, will be ''a very new investment dynamic for Europe.'' **********Banks see their indices playing into a European transformation whose precise course is still unclear and may, indeed, face many regulatory hurdles. **********Many fund managers are hoping, for instance, that a boom in private pensions will introduce vast new sums to the market, as happened in Britain, whose pension fund industry is bigger than all of continental Europe's combined. **********Against that, continental pensions are a ticking political time bomb. Many Europeans regard a comfortable state pension as an inalienable birthright and are uncomfortable with the notion of a private pension provision familiar to an increasing number of Americans. Moreover, European private pension funds, like European mutual funds, face regulatory restrictions. **********On top of that, Russia's meltdown has dampened appetites for corporate bonds, particularly high-yield bonds. That has made some assessments more cautious. Corporate bonds, said Mr. Bowers at Merrill Lynch, will provide ''one of the most exciting challenges that the euro will bring about.'' But this year's financial problems, he said, ''have left people a little nervous about rushing into this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/15/business/company-news-transmontaigne-plans-to-acquire-louis-dreyfus-energy.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-09-15", "snippet": "Transmontaigne Inc to buy part of Louis Dreyfus Corp's energy division for about $161 million in cash and stock (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRANSMONTAIGNE PLANS TO ACQUIRE LOUIS DREYFUS ENERGY", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; TRANSMONTAIGNE PLANS TO ACQUIRE LOUIS DREYFUS ENERGY", "body_text": " **********Transmontaigne Inc. agreed yesterday to buy part of the Louis Dreyfus Corporation's energy division for about $161 million in cash and stock to expand its business in the Southern and Eastern United States.

Then the Peace Pop was ruled obsolete. Next, a plan to create an organic ice cream line suffered a meltdown on business principles. **********The last few years have brought change and tumult to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., the counterculture's contribution to the ice cream industry. Sure, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the co-founders, still show up at the office in cutoff blue jeans and ride motorcycles for recreation across the rapidly disappearing Burlington countryside. And the company observed its 20th birthday on May 5 the same way it always has, with a nationwide handout of free cones. **********But much of Ben & Jerry's tie-dyed approach to life has vanished, replaced by a philosophy in which balance-sheet priorities have gained the upper hand. While no one is wearing three-piece suits to work just yet, and Mr. Cohen can still be found railing against the military-industrial complex, Ben & Jerry's has undergone a transformation in which practicality rules the roost and even the social mission for which the company became so well known is much more, um, corporate. **********Those fearing a sellout, however, should ponder this: Tightening the company's business practices is not only improving the bottom line, but also seems to be promoting performance when it comes to worthy causes. **********''In the past, you could put ideas out there, and sometimes they happened and sometimes they didn't,'' said Elizabeth A. Bankowski, the company's social mission director, recalling the company's earlier, erratic efforts at doing good. ''We now meet and identify social mission objectives by function, and it's taken as seriously as every other business objective.'' **********The person responsible for most of this is Perry D. Odak, who took over as chief executive 16 months ago and is widely credited with turning the company's fortunes around. **********Mr. Odak, a towering, soft-spoken veteran of companies ranging from Color Tile to the U.S. Repeating Arms rifle makers, replaced Robert Holland, who had been selected after a highly publicized nationwide search for someone to take over the day-to-day duties from Mr. Cohen, who remains the chairman, and Mr. Greenfield, the vice chairman. Mr. Holland, a McKinsey-trained consultant whose arrival was greeted with high hopes, lasted less than two years and left for ''personal reasons.'' **********When Mr. Odak arrived in January 1997, Ben & Jerry's sales were down, and more important, morale was battered. Was the social mission, which many employees said was highly important to them, something to be abandoned in the search for profits, or was it going to continue to be a priority? ''Ben & Jerry's has suffered through a leadership crisis over the past several years,'' the 1996 annual report stated bluntly. The company, the report acknowledged, was ''at a critical point.'' **********Mr. Odak, 52, spent part of the turbulent 1960's at Cornell University but was too busy putting himself through school -- by milking a herd of Brown Swiss cows twice a day -- to participate in student protests. He concedes a certain lack of wackiness, and when asked his favorite ice cream, he replied, ''It used to be butter pecan, but now it's always our newest flavor.'' **********But maybe the company was finally ready for a different kind of leader. When he arrived, Mr. Odak set about reviving the business, filling management slots that had long been vacant, redefining jobs and paying for market research. **********Ben & Jerry's has long had great name recognition -- 78 percent of those questioned in one poll had heard of the brand -- but a lot of people (50 percent in that poll) were not buying. Some consumers were put off by the high fat content, not to mention the steep price, of the ''super premium'' ice cream. But many others were confused by the packaging, according to Mr. Odak. **********''If you didn't get the funky names,'' he said, ''you didn't know what was in the package.'' To aid shoppers who lacked the time to figure out what Chubby Hubby, say, might contain (malt-flavored ice cream with chocolate-covered peanut-butter-filled pretzels), he redesigned the carton, pushing the picture of Ben and Jerry off the lid and onto the back and toning down the graphics so that more realistic pictures of the ingredients replaced the busy hand-drawn look. A $2 million radio advertising campaign was ordered up -- a lot for Ben & Jerry's. **********Two sagging products, the Peace Pop and the Brownie Bar, were abandoned. In their place came the Phish Stick (a fish-shaped, chocolate-covered confection named for the alternative-rock band) and a series of ice creams on sticks packaged in boxes a la Haagen-Dazs. (Cherry Garcia, a melange of vanilla, chocolate and cherries, is still sold. Some defunct flavors that retain a following, like Dastardly Mash, are being recycled this year.) **********''We needed to tone down the funkiness without losing the fun,'' Mr. Odak said. As for the Peace Pop's demise, he added: ''We said to ourselves, where is the equity? It's in the Ben & Jerry's name, not in the name Peace Pop.'' **********Last month, the company announced an alliance with the actor Paul Newman, in which it will manufacture Newman's Own ice cream. While Newman's Own sends its own profits on to charity, it will pay Ben & Jerry's for manufacturing the product. The new product will also absorb some of the company's excess factory capacity and give it a contender in the slightly less expensive ''premium'' ice cream category. ''It's a win-win-win situation,'' said Kim Galle, an analyst at Adams Harkness & Hill, a Boston investment bank. **********The company earlier this year introduced a new flavor, Dilbert's World Totally Nuts, tied to the popular comic strip. Mr. Odak plans to add more ''scoop shops,'' as the company's retail outlets are known, and at least five of those are to be operated with nonprofit groups to employ homeless or otherwise needy people. The company also plans to start selling its ice cream in half-gallon containers in a bid to increase sales volume. **********Beyond that, Mr. Odak has increased Ben & Jerry's presence abroad: A single-serving package is being marketed in Japan (with flavors carrying boring names like ''Coffee,'') and the company recently acquired a small French ice cream chain based in Paris. There is a new licensing effort as well, which will initially make jackets and shirts with the Ben & Jerry's logo and could lead to additional food and apparel products. **********All this seems to be working. Mr. Galle projects 12 percent growth in sales this year, to $194.4 million,  while earnings for the first quarter  were $380,000, compared with a $1.06 million loss for the corresponding period in 1997. The company still lags behind Haagen-Dazs, the leader in the super-premium category. Haagen-Dazs had supermarket sales of $157 million for the year that ended in late March, according to Information Resources Inc., while Ben & Jerry's took in $120 million from supermarket shoppers during the period. The ice cream business as a whole grew by 11.7 percent in that period, to $3.3 billion, according to Information Resources. **********The stock of Ben & Jerry's, which  made its debut at $30.50 a share in 1992 but had traded as low as $12 in  September 1997, is now hovering around the $20 mark, a development that has also aided employee morale. [The stock closed yesterday at $19.75.] **********The company's social agenda also appears to be back on track. Mr. Odak points proudly to an environmentally friendly container, made of unbleached paper, that the company has developed and is expected to start using later this year. **********Contrast that with some of the colorful but ultimately inefficient quirks that had prevailed under Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield. **********''Ben & Jerry's had a history of blurry lines between functions,'' said Ms. Bankowski, the social mission director, who is also a board member. ''Almost-meddling was an expected behavior, and decisions never seemed to be final. That was a part of the culture.'' **********Some plans really boomeranged. There was the time the company touted its environmental friendliness in arranging to use nuts from a Brazilian cooperative intended to discourage the cutting of rain forest trees. Highlighted on packages of Rainforest Crunch ice cream, the cooperative actually supplied only about 5 percent of the nuts used in the product. **********While the intentions were good, that 5 percent was judged way too low to be supporting the rain forest by the media, which took Ben & Jerry's to task over it. By last year, a spokesman said, a Peruvian cooperative was supplying most of the nuts. **********Mr. Odak ''has changed all that,'' Ms. Bankowski said. ''He holds people accountable,'' adding that performance reviews now reflect how well employees identify and meet their social mission objectives. Someone suggested cutting back on solid waste, and ''we now have a goal of reducing solid waste by 25 percent across the company.'' **********Mr. Galle, the investment analyst, said of Mr. Odak, ''This is a company that historically has not moved quickly, but he's been instrumental in getting them focused.'' **********Despite the improvement, there are still plenty of things that could give the company a jolt. One is cream prices, which were deregulated by the Federal Government in 1996. More increases could force Ben & Jerry's to raise its prices sooner than it would like, potentially putting growth on hold. **********Mr. Odak's shifts in direction have not always gone over well among old-timers. The decision to get rid of the Peace Pop, for example, left many feeling remorseful. ''There are people inside who really regretted that change,'' Ms. Bankowski said. Still, the organization that had inspired the Peace Pop name, One Percent for Peace, had itself ceased to exist. **********And the company continues to struggle to recruit and retain minority employees at all levels. Being situated in northern Vermont does not help. **********Meanwhile, a proposal to introduce a line of organic ice creams, seemingly perfect for a company like Ben & Jerry's, stumbled over the reality that no one could figure out how to sell it without losing money. ''The market indicated that people did not perceive the added value,'' Ms. Bankowski said. ''Ben is very disappointed with this decision.'' **********It all represents a coming of age for the company. When it comes to doing good deeds, not to mention selling ice cream, Ms. Bankowski added, ''Nothing is simple anymore.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/world/russia-s-tax-police-press-media-message-pay-up.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1998-03-08", "snippet": "Russia's tax service to begin media blitz to prod tax-shirking Russians to file their tax returns before April 1 deadline; low level of compliance in Russia noted; last year, Russian Govt collected only about 52 percent of taxes due; last year in ...", "word_count": 1180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia's Tax Police Press Media Message: Pay Up", "print_headline": "Russia's Tax Police Press Media Message: Pay Up", "body_text": " **********When medieval Russian villagers savagely beat Prince Igor for trying to make them pay taxes, bad things happen: His redoubtable wife, Princess Olga, rides up to their wooden fortress with a posse of soldiers, then sets a flock of sparrows on fire and releases them to burn down the village. **********As cartoon messages go, this latest Russian television advertisement has been a bit confusing to viewers. It is not aimed at promoting animal abuse. Rather, the cartoon is a fractured slice of Russian history served up by the Russian tax service to persuade Russian children that people should pay taxes -- or else. **********Starting this month, a series of similar cartoon ads will begin flooding the airwaves of Russian state-owned television, part of a media blitz before the April 1 deadline for filing tax returns, which in tax-shirking Russia is partly a day of national mourning -- and partly a 24-hour frenzy of April Fool's trickery. Last year, the Russian Government collected only about 52 percent of the taxes due. Last year in Moscow, a city of 10 million, only 120,000 people filed their income taxes on time. **********Seventy years of Soviet culture, when the state owned everything and minimal taxes on wages were deducted directly at the workplace, is one reason Russians balk at the unfamiliar civic duty. The Byzantine and often punitive Russian tax code is another. President Boris N. Yeltsin has vowed to submit a new tax code by the middle of this year, but passage of the deeply contested bill in the Parliament is highly problematic. **********Seeking to enforce the existing tax laws, frustrated Russian tax inspectors are now aiming at the next generation. **********''We need to broaden our audience,'' Aleksandr Borisov, a spokesman for the Moscow tax service, said. ''If we want to someday create a normal government, then we need to also develop a normal sense of citizenship -- it's a long process, and it may take another generation before we get to that point.'' **********The Government's Pied Piper advertising campaign has provoked some cynicism among Russians, who doubt such cartoons will change deeply entrenched public attitudes. **********''The whole country now knows about tooth decay,'' Sergei N. Yenekolopov, a well-known Russian child psychologist, said. ''But I doubt more people are brushing their teeth in the morning.'' **********Tax evasion is a deeply rooted cultural trait, Mr. Yenekolopov said,  mythified in folk tales that glorify Russian peasants refusing to pay tribute to the Tartar invaders -- a message, he added, that the tax police's historical cartoon inadvertently reinforces. He said he did not approve of reaching out to children to get at the parents. **********''At worst, it could result in a horde of Pavlik Morozovs,'' he said, referring to a little boy who was murdered after informing on his parents to the Bolsheviks, and became a Stalinist martyr. ''Children could blackmail their parents with a call to the tax police if their parents reprimand them for bad grades in school.'' **********The Soviet tradition of encouraging citizens to inform on their neighbors, moreover, is still embedded in the tax code: People who report tax evasion to the tax police can receive a reward of up to 10 percent of the hidden income. **********Some recent high-profile efforts to install a sense of civic duty in the present generation of taxpayers have backfired: after the Russian skier Larisa Lazutina won three gold medals at the Nagano Winter Olympics and was awarded close to $1 million in bonus prize money from the Russian Olympic Committee, the Government and other sources, a senior tax service official quickly announced that she and other Olympic winners would have to hand over 35 percent of their winnings in taxes. A storm of outrage forced the Government to back down this week. **********Russian authorities are also seeking to link tax evasion to sexual impotence. In a television ad prepared by Video International, the same Russian advertising company that produced the children's cartoons, a man is shown, sitting up half-naked in bed, mournfully clicking his bedside lamp on and off, as the beautiful woman next to him turns away angrily. **********The voice-over says: ''Lost your desire? That's nerves. Pay your taxes and live peacefully.'' **********But the truth is that in Russia, tax evaders for the most part do live peacefully. Everybody cheats, and only the unlucky few get caught. The Russian tax system, created from scratch in 1992, is filled with paradoxes. The tax police have far broader license than even United States Internal Revenue Service officers to seize assets. (Last month, the Government finally issued a ruling requiring tax inspectors to obtain a court order before seizing a suspected tax evader's bank accounts.) **********On the other hand, the vast and poorly audited Russian bureaucracy makes it much easier for Russians to hide their income and assets from the Government. Companies rely on off-shore corporations and fanciful records. Individual citizens register their property in the name of obscure front companies and long-lost cousins. And like anywhere else, the rich have a far easier time hiding their real income than do small-time wage-earners. **********''If you believe their statements, bank officers earn the lowest salaries in Russia,'' Mr. Borisov said, lamenting that business executives who own dachas, luxury apartments and foreign cars get away with declaring incomes of $100 a month. So do politicians and entertainment figures. **********Last year Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said he would set an example and release his income declaration. Mr. Chernomyrdin, former chairman of the giant monopoly Gazprom and widely believed to one of the richest men in Russia, said he earned just $8,000 in 1996. He set his net worth at $50,000. **********After Alla Pugachova, Russia's most popular pop star, was hauled into a special meeting of celebrities with tax officials, she complained that touring expenses had left her almost destitute. She pleaded for a tax amnesty and contended that she was being forced to return to work because she had not earned enough to retire. **********''I am going back to singing again, and all because of my desperate financial situation,'' she said. **********The tax laws, on the other hand, give people reason to cheat. **********Russia charges companies a 4 percent tax on their gross income. **********On top of that, the Russian corporate profit tax is 35 percent -- which is not significantly higher than the rate on American companies, except that Russian companies are not allowed to deduct business expenses. The Russian value-added tax is 20 percent, two times higher than the highest sales taxes in the United States. Similarly, the top tax bracket, on incomes of $8,000 a year or more, is 35 percent and there are no deductions allowed for charitable contributions, business expenses, medical costs or property taxes. **********And the tax service does not always inspire trust. The Russian tax police have special elite units that seize bank assets and property while clad in bullet-proof armor and black helmets and carrying automatic weapons. They look more like commandos than accountants. **********With this in mind, Mr. Borisov said the Government's humorous ad campaigns were also aimed at softening the image of the tax police. **********''We need to show we are special forces with a human face,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/07/world/mountains-of-bad-debt-stifle-russian-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1998-08-07", "snippet": "Russia's financial crisis is playing itself out on wider landscape of Russian economy; looming largest of all is mountain of unpaid bills that have accumulated as companies, private and government, run out of money to pay each other, their workers...", "word_count": 1225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mountains of Bad Debt Stifle Russian Economy", "print_headline": "Mountains of Bad Debt Stifle Russian Economy", "body_text": " **********It was April when Dmitri Chernikh saw the first ripples of Russia's financial crisis lapping at the door of Galatica, one of Russia's hottest computer software companies. **********It was not the collapse of the Russian financial markets, or the dizzying leap in interest rates, or even the first uncertain steps of the country's new untested Government that worried Mr. Chernikh or his fellow directors. Like most other young Russian businesses, Galatica, with $8 million in sales last year, does not trade its shares publicly, nor has it ever sought bank loans, rates for which were prohibitive even before the latest financial panic. **********What hit Galatica last spring was something more basic, and more endemic to Russia's unfinished economic crisis: a pileup of unpaid bills, which by midsummer had topped $3 million, as the company's biggest clients -- mostly in the rich and powerful energy sector -- stopped payments on Galatica's popular management software package. **********Even after the agreement last month for a $22.6 billion package of credits and loans, Russia's financial crisis is still playing itself out on the wider landscape of the Russian economy -- if a devastated industrial base, an infant private sector and a cartel of moguls who control banking, raw materials and other key sectors can be properly called an economy. **********Like the Government, Galatica swung quickly into crisis mode. **********One option considered at the first emergency meeting was a joke: ''Change countries.'' But the company's directors -- computer whizzes from Moscow State University who founded Galatica in the early days of Soviet economic reform --were searching for a more realistic response. **********Briefly, they considered a get-tough approach. Threatening letters were sent out to clients, warning them that Galatica would cut off consulting services to companies that did not pay their bills. **********But like other attempts at breaking through the wall of Russian arrears, this bluff fell flat. **********''The response was so tough that we backed off,'' Mr. Chernikh said. ''At that point we decided that if the country is in bad shape and our clients are in bad shape, we would just have to suffer, too.'' **********Looming largest of all is the mountain of unpaid bills that have accumulated as companies, private and government, run out of money to pay each other, their workers or their taxes. **********There is even a thriving trade in debts. At the end of 1996, overdue debts constituted one third of all accounts payable to enterprises, forcing producers to rely on barter for their commercial transactions. **********As the Government moves to tighten monetary policy further, even less money is available, particularly for businesses like Galatica that offer services that many of its customers -- caught in a squeeze between newly aggressive tax collectors and angry unpaid workers -- consider low priority. **********Small companies anywhere are vulnerable to sudden financial shifts, but in Russia, the small-business sector -- much of which exists below the radar of Government data collectors -- is particularly exposed, lacking both access to credit and the protection of a well-developed system for bankruptcy and other restructuring. **********For most Russian businesses, borrowing money from local banks is not feasible, given the continuing rise in interest rates, which were already at punishing levels of about 40 percent a year for short-term loans before the crisis hit. According to one recent report, credits to the private sector in Russia amount to only 7 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 15 percent in Poland, 24 percent in Hungary or 111 percent in Germany. **********For small companies like Galatica, which employs almost 500 people in offices scattered around the former Soviet Union, seeking investors through a public offering of shares is not realistic either, particularly now with the uncertainties that cloud Russian markets. **********As the crisis deepens, many are predicting that more and more Russian companies, small and large, are going to have to scale back already pared down operations. **********''Regardless of whether people have access to bank loans, there is a single pool of capital,'' said Edwin Dolan, president of the Moscow-based American Institute of Business and Economics, which offers a master's degree in business administration. ''The tightening of monetary policy is going to affect access to working capital, which in turn tightens the nonpayment crisis.'' **********Galatica's strategy has been to look beyond its big clients in Russia's energy sector -- which have been hit hard by a drop in world energy prices -- and focus on more stable sectors, like retailing and food processing, which have more direct links to consumers. It has been helped by a recent merger with Parus, another Russian software company that built up a diverse clientele, and by its operations outside Russia, in former Soviet states like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. **********Coping with financial crises is not a new challenge for Galatica, which also saw payments grind to a halt in the period before the 1996 presidential elections. Then Russia's money supply dried up dramatically for several months as foreign investors, fearing a Communist victory, stayed away, and as the Russian Government drained its budget to help President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election effort. **********''In 1996, the crisis was much bigger than now,'' Mr. Chernikh said. ''Then people stopped paying altogether. But each passing crisis is a little less alarming. It is like gunfire. The first time is frightening, the next time a little less.'' **********Two years later, after a boom year in 1997 when sales more than tripled, Galatica's directors are relatively sanguine about their ability to survive without layoffs or major restructuring. Even a devaluation of the ruble, which to most analysts would be the worst-case scenario for the Russian economy, might not so devastating. For one thing, noted Mr. Chernikh, Galatica has always set its prices in dollars, a practice that dates back to the early 1990's when the value of the ruble was being whipped by inflation. **********Since 1992, when the company developed its first program to help companies manage their resources, Galatica has geared its management programs to reflect the way their clients actually do business, not the way they should according to Western business school textbooks. **********From Soviet-style bookkeeping to  barter transactions, Mr. Chernikh says Galtica's programs have kept up with Russia's reality. **********''Western companies solve their problems very differently from Russian companies,'' he said. ''Here, for instance, a contract is not a contract  in the Western sense. It can change during implementation, which is something we have taken into account.'' **********From its beginnings as an enterprising team from Moscow State University's prestigious mechanical and mathematics department then operating on the outer edges of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's first economic reforms, the company has had the advantage of direct experience with Russia's lurching progress towards a market economy, even as it kept close ties with the wave of Russian ''computershiki'' who emigrated in the late 1980's to Silicon Valley in California. **********An important break came in 1988 when Galatica won the contract to computerize the electronic voting at the Congress of People's Deputies, an elected gathering that was to usher in political reform to the Soviet Union. But its biggest advantage was to be one of the first on what was then an empty playing field. **********''For a long time in Russia, you could do something in Russia without money,'' Mr. Chernikh said. ''Now it is already more complicated. The importance of having a name, a reputation, has much more meaning now than it did even five years ago, and that requires more money up front.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/business/business-diary-data-offer-no-hint-yet-of-a-slowing-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-11-29", "snippet": "American gross domestic product posts 3.9 percent gain in third quarter, confounding warnings that Asian and Russian economic crises would slow US economy (S)", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data Offer No Hint Yet Of a Slowing Economy", "print_headline": "BUSINESS: DIARY; Data Offer No Hint Yet Of a Slowing Economy", "body_text": " **********Soak it, sleep in it, leave it out in a storm: Nothing seems to shrink or even much wrinkle the American economy. **********The gross domestic product posted a healthy 3.9 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter, confounding widespread warnings that the continuing economic crisis in Asia and Russia and the resulting turmoil in financial markets would slow down the economy.

The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term. **********INTEREST RATES **********No Increase, for Now **********The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise. **********MARKETS **********Commodity Index Skids **********The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks. **********TOBACCO **********A Pipe Dream? **********Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. ''We are making a deal with the Devil,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability. **********SOCIAL SECURITY **********A Market-Based Proposal **********The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. ''The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits. **********DEALS **********A Merger Epidemic **********What would once have been a big deal seems today to be business as usual. Seagram, accelerating its shift from beverages and spirits into an entertainment powerhouse, agreed to buy Polygram, one of the world's largest music companies, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock; to raise money for the acquisition, Seagram is shedding its Tropicana juice business. . . . Pearson, Britain's largest publisher, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas investment firm, agreed to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom for $4.6 billion in cash. . . . Office Depot said it would acquire Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap. . . . Dillard's said it would acquire Mercantile Stores, a Midwest retailer, for $2.9 billion in cash. . . . Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, agreed to acquire Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest, for $11.1 billion. . . . Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought 29.1 percent of Christie's earlier this month, said he would buy the rest in a deal that values the international auction house at $1.2 billion. . . .

In Taipei, a nurse displayed a bag of the medication.

A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was investigating but continued to believe the drug was safe and effective and had asked Pfizer to provide more information to patients on the proper use of the drug.

And money is flowing out of such funds: $810 million this year through Oct. 31, Lipper says. **********Tough times. But opportunity often arises out of adversity. **********One person with that opinion is J. Mark Mobius, the globe-trotting manager of eight Franklin/Templeton emerging-markets funds. Mr. Mobius took some time during a stop last week in Santiago, Chile, to talk about investing's new outcasts. **********Q. It's been more than a year since the onset of the Asian crisis began to shake emerging markets, and lots of investors have left. Who are the buyers? **********A. At this stage, some people who have been badly burned are saying they will never again be in emerging markets, and have bailed out. But there are three types of investors who are competing for assets. **********First there are portfolio investors like us, who are in for the long haul and whose clients have not abandoned them. **********But there are also strategic investors, like the G.E.'s or Coca-Cola's, who are picking up listed companies for a song. **********And there are private equity investors who are also picking up bargains in listed and unlisted companies. **********So there is competition for assets in these countries. While it may not be so evident in price movements, as more money comes in, I think prices will rise rather dramatically. **********Q. Can you give us some examples? **********A. In Argentina, a company called Bunge & Born owns a controlling interest in a packaged- and canned-goods company called Molinos. We happen to be an 11 percent holder of Molinos, which Bunge & Born wants to sell. Whoever buys control could easily say they are delisting this company. **********Another example is a South African company called Angen, formerly owned by Mobil. Mobil sold out at very low prices because of apartheid. About a year ago, Petronas, the Malaysian oil company, bought about 30 percent of the shares and made an offer to buy all the shares at double the market price. Everyone but us jumped at it. **********Q. How long will it take to rebound? **********A. I don't think it will take more than a year. The obvious place it will happen first is Asia. A lot of people are searching for assets there, because they are cheap. **********Q. But can Asia start to grow without a healthy Japan? **********A. As long as the United States economy continues to expand, Asia can grow without Japan. If the American economy goes in the tank, recovery in Asia will be slower. But Japan is not vital to the growth of Asia. **********Q. You sound more optimistic now about these markets than you did when we last talked, in September 1997. Is that so? **********A.  I am more optimistic now, because back then there was so much uncertainty. Now we are in a situation where you could get some explosive upside movement. **********Q. Where are you invested? **********A.  Well, for the first time in years we are almost 100 percent invested. About 35 percent of the money is in Latin America, a little less in Asia. The rest is in South Africa, Eastern Europe, places like that. Our biggest countries are Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, each with between 8 percent and 10 percent of assets. **********Q. A year ago you voiced concern that the Malaysian Government's decision to impose controls on capital flows would spread through Asia. Is that still a worry? **********A.  We were quite depressed when they announced capital controls, and we were afraid that policy would spread to other countries. But I am happy to report the Malaysians are having second thoughts about that policy. They are beginning to ask for meetings to talk about changes, because I think they realize they are being cut off from tremendous flows of capital. But even if they do alter that position, the issue of crony capitalism is still there. **********Q. Has the past year prompted other changes that are important to investors? **********A.  A couple come immediately to mind. **********Many markets that have been illiquid and had restrictive regulations on stock ownership, as in Chile, have listed the assets in New York and London. That has created more liquidity. **********Minority shareholder rights is another important area. One of the reasons a lot of people were disillusioned about these markets is that shareholders really had no rights. But a number of countries, including Chile, are now talking about equal economic rights of shareholders. That is not a revolutionary idea to us, but it is to them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/10/business/the-markets-bonds-bonds-turn-downward-as-dollar-continues-to-weaken.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1998-04-10", "snippet": "US Government bonds close mostly lower; Treasury's 30-year issue rises 7/32, to price of 103 15/32, while its yield declines to 5.88 percent, from 5.89 percent on April 8; chart (L)", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonds Turn Downward as Dollar Continues to Weaken", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: BONDS; Bonds Turn Downward as Dollar Continues to Weaken", "body_text": " **********Bonds closed mostly lower yesterday, hurt by further weakness in the dollar and suggestions that the Federal Reserve may be less concerned than previously believed about the impact of Asia's problems on the domestic economy. **********The Treasury's 30-year issue ended slightly higher in a trading session shortened by the Easter holiday.

These countries, and others, are getting less for commodities, whether it is oil, copper, platinum or zinc. **********''My view is that the markets haven't sensed how seriously this can be for the global economy,'' said Lawrence J. Brainard, head of emerging-market research at Chase Securities. ''I think it is a sleeper.'' **********The intensifying commodity problem is expected to lead to bigger bond defaults in Russia and -- at a minimum -- sharp budget-cutting in many Latin American and other nations that could aggravate political uncertainty. In addition, growth will slow in a world that aside from the United States and Europe is already in a recession or on the edge. **********Commodity prices have been one of the two key conduits for transmitting the Asian financial crisis around the world. The other has been stock markets, which have gotten more attention from investors. Lower commodity prices are mostly seen as a boon for investors, reducing costs on gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, food and many manufactured products. **********The stock markets in many of the troubled countries are rebounding now, after central bank interest-rate cuts in the United States and Europe and an International Monetary Fund rescue package for Brazil helped calm investor fears of a global recession. **********But the worldwide demand that is needed to turn commodity prices around is not showing up. Two closely followed commodity indexes -- the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index -- are at their lowest levels in more than two decades. Commodities are so weak that Citigroup may sell its Phibro commodity business. **********Actually, a 10-month slide in commodity prices that began in the fall of 1997 -- when the effects of the Asian crisis first hit the United States -- was more steep and damaging than the second wave of declines that began in mid-November. From October 1997 until the end of August this year, the Commodity Research index plunged 21 percent, then leveled off. But since Nov. 12 it has dropped almost 8 percent. **********What worries analysts now is that the recent decline is a signal that prices will not turn around soon. **********Matthew J. Sagers, the director of the energy service of Planecon, a consulting group specializing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said the consensus on oil prices ''is that we are going to be here for several years.'' **********Mr. Brainard and other analysts argue that an extended period of lost economic growth and lower governmental revenues stemming from the drop in commodity prices will raise the pressure on many already troubled governments and economies. That could intensify investor concern and weaken currencies. To defend those currencies, central banks would have to raise their interest rates -- which would mean even slower growth. **********The impact on Russia, for example, has been stark. The country's $87 billion in 1997 exports included $21.9 billion in oil, $16.4 billion in gas and $14 billion in metals -- about 60 percent of the total. **********But the prices of every one of these commodities have fallen sharply and are still declining. The price of platinum, for which Russia is the second major supplier, has dropped almost 12 percent just since July. The price of oil plunged 36 percent -- from around $22 a barrel in October 1997 to around $14 in August -- and has fallen another 23 percent, to $10.72, since November. **********These sectors, especially energy, are a critical source of tax revenue for the Russian Government. About a third of Government budget revenues come from energy taxes, according to Marcel Cassard, the chief economist for emerging Europe at Deutsche Bank in London. **********The exact impact the recent commodity price decline will have on the Russian budget and spending is hard to tell; the draft 1999 budget is already hard to interpret because it includes new tax cuts. The Government budget, adopted yesterday, reduces both the value-added tax and the corporate tax, and does not impose, as some analysts had hoped, new export taxes on energy. **********Even so, Mr. Cassard said, ''you would have to assume lower revenues.'' **********The most immediate fallout from this commodities pricing squeeze, several analysts said, will be even more Russian defaults on foreign loans, as the Government diverts those interest and principal payments to cover the cost of domestic programs. **********Russia owes about $17 billion of interest and principal payments this year, including $5 billion to the I.M.F. The Government included debt payments of just $9.5 billion in its draft budget. **********In fact, the Government has already asked the foreign goverment leaders in the so-called Paris Club and the foreign bank lenders in the London Club to restructure and stretch out their debt payments. **********But now analysts say that even the goal of $9.5 billion will not be met. ''Looking at the budget assumptions and the exchange rate, they will have serious problems servicing even $5 billion of debt,'' said Gretchen R. Rodkey, the Russian and East European bond analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Analysts say the only bonds they are sure will be serviced are the Russian Eurobonds that had been issued by the present Government after the fall of the old Soviet Union. **********The commodity price decline is also hurting countries with more economic importance to the United States and the world. The Mexican Government said last week that the drop in oil prices would cut its budget revenue by as much as $1.5 billion next year, forcing it into a tough debate on how to close the gap. The oil price decline could also slow economic growth. **********In Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader and political outsider, was elected president on Sunday, oil accounts for 70 percent of the country's exports and 50 percent of its budget revenue. **********And as Mr. Chavez determines the new path to take Venezuela -- and the spending to support it -- investors will remember that for every decline in the price of oil, Venezuela's revenues will suffer more than those of any other Latin American nation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/18/world/us-says-it-told-russia-2-days-before-balkan-aerial-maneuvers.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1998-06-18", "snippet": "Western officials deny charge by Russian Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, that Russia was not given advance word of NATO's aerial military exercises in Balkans; say Russia was notified Russia two days in advance; say NATO Sec Gen Javier Solana inf...", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says It Told Russia 2 Days Before Balkan Aerial Maneuvers", "print_headline": "U.S. Says It Told Russia 2 Days Before Balkan Aerial Maneuvers", "body_text": " **********Top NATO officials formally notified Russia about Monday's aerial military exercises in the Balkans two days before they took place, Western officials said today, although Russian officials have complained they were left in the dark. **********The Russian Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, created a political tempest here on Monday when he  publicly rebuked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.

Western analysts say there are several possible explanations for the Russian reaction. **********One view is that Mr. Sergeyev was simply posturing. In an effort to persuade Serbian leaders to stop their crackdown in Kosovo , NATO planned the air exercise for the eve of meetings in Moscow between Russian officials and Mr. Milosevic. The meetings resulted in a joint statement by Russia and Serbia in which Mr. Milosevic agreed to reopen talks with Kosovo leaders, but refused to bend on the key demand that he withdraw his forces from the province. **********The Russian Defense Minister may have been trying to distance himself from the air exercise and inoculate himself against criticism that he was cooperating too closely with the Americans. **********Even before the exercise, Mr. Sergeyev expressed concerns about it.  But over the weekend Mr. Sergeyev sent a letter to General Naumann, protesting the timing and saying that it was the first step toward NATO military intervention in Kosovo. **********General Naumann sent a reply to the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday evening. In his response, General Naumann denied that the exercise necessarily presaged military action. **********Another interpretation of Mr. Sergeyev's response is that he was genuinely surprised because the Russian officials in Brussels had failed to  pass on the notification quickly. **********''There is no problem with NATO-Russia communications,'' said one diplomat. ''But there may be a problem with Russia-Russia communications.

As Orthodox political parties hold a third of his governing coalition's seats in Parliament, the political, as well as the religious, stakes are high. **********Even as Reform and Conservative leaders denounced today's decision, Mr. Netanyahu issued a statement congratulating the Chief Rabbinate.  He hailed it for a decision that he said ''promotes a national consensus among the Jewish people and the state of Israel, which all of us are striving for.'' **********The sharply conflicting reactions to the decision today reflected the acute sense on all sides that the struggle over conversion, and the broader questions it raised of religious rights and freedoms in Israel, was entering a new and fateful stage. **********The compromise proposal was offered after eight months of intense negotiations by a committee headed by Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman. It would let the Chief Rabbinate keep control over actual conversions but would prepare candidates for conversion at an institute in which all three branches of Judaism were represented. The Chief Rabbinate is controlled by the Orthodox. **********But with the decision today, Reform and Conservative leaders announced that they would immediately resume the legal and political battles for recognition of their conversions that they had suspended during the search for a compromise. **********That, in turn, would prompt the Orthodox to press for passage of a law that would codify their monopoly on conversions. The Orthodox political parties in Mr. Netanyahu's coalition have vowed to bolt if the bill is defeated. **********The Neeman proposal was acceptable to the Reform and Conservative leaders, but ultra-Orthodox rabbis vehemently opposed allowing even that small measure of recognition for movements they hold to be deviations from true Judaism. **********The problem for the Chief Rabbis was that if they rejected the compromise, they would lose support in Parliament and would not be able to block the legal challenges of the non-Orthodox movements. **********Today's decision by the 150-member Chief Rabbinate Council was reportedly a result of four hours of intensive efforts by Mr. Neeman, the official charged by Mr. Netanyahu last July to work out a compromise. Mr. Neeman worked to hammer out a statement that satisfied the ultra-Orthodox rabbis and yet did not formally reject the compromise. **********Mr. Neeman's key tactic was to ask the Chief Rabbinate to act only on the clause giving them monopoly over conversions, on the premise that the joint institute that would have supervised conversions was supposed to be set up by the Jewish Agency, a Government agency, and not by the Chief Rabbis. **********Thus the rabbinical council's resolution proclaimed that it had ''received definitive and absolute clarification that it was asked to discuss nothing but the issue of conversion itself.'' The resolution went on to lambaste the non-Orthodox movements, not even deigning to mention their names, but referring to them only as those who have ''brought about disastrous results of assimilation among Diaspora Jewry.'' **********''The Sages of Israel have forbidden any cooperation with them and their methods,'' the resolution declared. ''One cannot consider establishing a joint institute with them.'' **********A senior Government official close to the effort insisted that this ambivalent approach was a ''very diplomatic way to overcome the problem, and to accept the Neeman committee report.'' **********He insisted that the Chief Rabbinate's declaration against establishing a joint institute was not a rejection, since the Chief Rabbinate had not been called on to ''establish'' such an institute, but only to take part in it. **********Such hair-splitting failed to convince Reform and Conservative leaders, who saw nothing positive in getting the Chief Rabbinate to accept a monopoly on conversions without the only concession requested of them, the joint institute. **********''The heart of the proposal was the establishment of a course for joint preparation of converts, and it was that which made it possible for us to make concessions in other areas,'' said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a Reform group, in New York. **********''By turning it down, the Rabbinate makes the whole process into a joke,'' he added. ''And for the Prime Minister to suggest in any way that what they agreed to was an acceptance of the compromise is outrageous. I want to assure him that the vast majority of American Jews will see these matters considerably differently. This is a sad day for Jewry.'' **********In Jerusalem, the Conservative and Reform leaders who had negotiated with Mr. Neeman, Rabbi Ehud Bandel of the Masorti (Conservative) Movement and Rabbi Uri Regev of the Israeli Religious Action Center, a Reform group, issued a statement declaring that they would revive their suspended legal actions as of Wednesday. **********''The Chief Rabbinate's resolution is a resounding slam of the door of compromise and a declaration of war on the Jewish people,'' they said. ''Now we find no choice but to renew, beginning tomorrow, the struggle to register those converted by the rabbinic courts of our movements and the struggle to seat Reform and Conservative representatives on religious councils.'' **********These actions were initiated by the Reform and Conservative movements as part of their longstanding struggle to be recognized in Israel as legitimate forms of Judaism. The struggle has become more acute in recent years, as the non-Orthodox movements turned to Israeli courts while the Orthodox parties gained political strength. **********Thus after non-Orthodox movements filed several cases with Israeli courts to have their conversions recognized, the Orthodox parties, using their new power as key members of Mr. Netanyahu's right-religious coalition, introduced a conversion bill to formalize their monopoly on conversions to Judaism in Israel. **********The issue has gained in importance with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews, of whom many are either not Jewish by strict Orthodox law or cannot prove that they are. The authority to convert is also important because acceptance as a Jew includes the right to settle in Israel. **********Seeking to avoid a conflict that threatened to undermine his Government and to create a serious rift with American Jews, Mr. Netanyahu persuaded both sides to put their legal suits and legislation on hold while Mr. Neeman searched for a compromise. **********But the Neeman committee seemed headed for deadlock as Orthodox rabbis adamantly rejected any dealings with the Reform and Conservative. To prevent a showdown, Avraham Burg, the chairman of the Jewish Agency, proposed a temporary compromise under which religion would not be listed on an Israeli's identity card. **********But Reform and Conservative leaders, especially in the United States, have shown less and less interest in putting off a confrontation. **********Through intense lobbying in the last eight months, they have succeeded in eroding support in the Israeli Parliament for the conversion bill. **********The specific actions that the Reform and Conservative movements now threaten to revive include a lawsuit to compel the Government to recognize 23 conversions that they performed, and other suits to compel local religious councils in the cities of Arad, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa to seat non-Orthodox members who have already been appointed or elected."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/20/world/mexicans-belittle-drug-money-sting.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Preston", "pub_date": "1998-05-20", "snippet": "Mexican officials seek to belittle results of huge United States undercover operation that exposed laundering of drug money in 12 Mexican banks after Federal grand jury in Los Angeles unsealed three indictments against Mexican bankers and their cl...", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexicans Belittle Drug-Money Sting", "print_headline": "Mexicans Belittle Drug-Money Sting", "body_text": " **********Mexican officials sought today to belittle  the results of a huge United States undercover operation that exposed the laundering of drug money in 12 Mexican banks. **********On Monday a Federal grand jury in Los Angeles unsealed three indictments against Mexican bankers and their clients in drug organizations based in Cali, Colombia, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. More than $72 million in drug proceeds was seized during the three-year undercover operation, which spread across six countries and involved about 200 agents from the United States Customs Service and other agencies. **********Three Mexican banks -- Bancomer, Banca Serfin and Banca Confia -- were indicted as institutions. United States Justice Department officials said they felt that the pattern of money-laundering through these banks was so systemic that it would not be enough to indict individual employees. **********The indictments dealt a shock to Mexico, disclosing a much easier and more pervasive movement of narcotics proceeds through the financial system than Mexican officials have been willing to acknowledge. **********The investigation showed gaping loopholes in American and Mexican laws that allowed traffickers to move their proceeds relatively easily despite an array of Customs regulations in both countries intended to  insure monitoring of big cash transactions. **********Yet Eduardo Fernandez Garcia, the president of the National Banking Commission, Mexico's bank regulatory agency, dismissed the indictments as overblown. **********''I didn't like the way the United States authorities announced this,'' Mr. Fernandez said in a television interview this morning. ''They made it seem as though they were announcing something terribly important. But I think this has been taken out of context. It seems much more important than it really is.'' **********Mr. Fernandez noted that none of the Mexican bank employees arrested were top-level executives. Most of the 14 bankers arrested since May 16 were local managers and executives who worked in Tijuana and Guadalajara. **********Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino said that although millions of dollars passed through the money-laundering scheme, the amounts were not large enough to pose any risk to the banking system as a whole. **********The huge undercover operation exposed connections between several of Mexico's most important banks and the top financial operator for the Juarez organization, Jose Alvarez Tostado. Mr. Alvarez set up a network of willing bankers and stockbrokers across Mexico and eventually introduced them to undercover Customs agents who were posing as brokers for Colombian drug barons, Customs officials said. **********At the urging of the United States, Mexico is preparing an arrest warrant for Mr. Alvarez. His top deputy in the Juarez organization, Victor Alcala Navarro, was arrested in Las Vegas on Sunday. **********The operation started in 1995 when Customs agents in Colombia were approached by members of the Cali cartel who were looking for ways to bring home the profits from cocaine and marijuana sales in the United States, Customs officials said. **********The Colombians introduced the undercover agents to Mr. Alcala. Over time, as American agents gained the confidence of the Juarez traffickers, they were contracted to broker millions of dollars in drug proceeds from sales in Chicago, Miami, Houston, New York and Los Angeles, Customs officials said. **********''We did not approach any bankers,'' a Customs official said. ''They all came to us.'' He said the Mexican bankers were all informed by the undercover agents that the money came from drug transactions in meetings that were secretly recorded on videotape. Because of this evidence, Justice officials say they are confident that the defendants will not be able to argue that they were illegally entrapped. **********The bankers stepped forward to offer their services to open accounts in Mexican banks for fictitious corporations they set up, a Customs official said. **********In the United States, operatives for the Colombian and Mexican drug organizations collected cash profits from street sales of drugs. Undercover agents then turned the money  over to American banks in the United States that were cooperating with the sting. Bank of America in Los Angeles was one of the main American conduits. **********The American banks then sent the funds by internal bank wire transfers to the fictitious corporate accounts opened at banks in Mexico. Mexican bankers working with the drug organizations then converted the funds into cashier's checks made out to fictitious individuals. **********These checks are drawn on accounts belonging to the banks themselves, not to individuals, and so can be cashed all over the world. They were sent on to Cali drug operatives in Colombia, or were stashed away in secret Customs accounts. American officials acknowledged that to keep the operation going over three years without arousing the traffickers' suspicions, they were forced to complete laundering transactions worth millions of dollars for Mexican and Colombian dealers. **********Customs officials said that, in all,  20 cartel operatives and 22 bankers or money-launderers were arrested in the final stage of the operation in the last three days. The arrests include middle-level drug organization officials, many based in the United States, who helped in money-laundering operations. The suspects include 24 Mexicans who were lured to Las Vegas and San Diego in sting operations to avoid the time-consuming risk of asking the Mexican authorities to detain them. **********Julie Shemitz, an Assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles, said that American officials did not share any information about the operation with Mexico while it was under way out of fear for the safety of the undercover agents. **********''It's not that we don't trust the Mexicans,'' Ms. Shemitz said. ''We just didn't tell anyone. This kind of operation is so dangerous, and you can't play games with the lives of the officers.'' **********One Customs agent working under cover was shot and wounded in a shootout between narcotics traffickers and police officers in New York City on Aug. 6, 1997. **********Money transfers by wire between banks, even when they cross borders, are not subject to any of the tight regulations that govern other cash transactions, Ms. Shemitz said.

Yet rumors abound here of deals in gold, and dealers in diamonds talk about a mysterious Belgian who they believe is buying lots of them on Ugandans' behalf. **********''What are they doing 1,000 kilometers from the border if this is a question of security?'' a priest here asked of both Uganda and Rwanda, the two nations that are supporting the rebellion. ''This is not a problem of security. This is another problem.'' **********The priest's words were echoed last week with a skepticism that Uganda's president, Yoweri K. Museveni -- an ally of many Western nations, especially the United States -- is unused to hearing from foreign friends. At a meeting in Uganda of rich nations that give money to poor ones, the European Union released a statement recognizing Uganda's ''legitimate security concerns'' in Congo. **********''At the same time,'' the statement said, ''it is doubtful that the current level of military presence and activity up to 700 kilometers away from the Ugandan border serve that purpose.'' **********What, exactly, Uganda is doing in Congo seems to be a bit of a mystery even to Uganda itself, if one takes the nation's leaders on their word. But the general contours are clear: since August, Uganda has lodged its presence deep into its neighbor's territory, aside a group of rebels and Rwandan soldiers seeking to overthrow the Congolese President, Laurent Kabila. **********Only last year, Uganda and Rwanda helped Mr. Kabila to take power in a similar war. No one wept then for Mobutu Sese Seko, for 32 years the dictator of what was then known as Zaire. **********This time, though, there is no pretense that Uganda and Rwanda are not key players -- to the point that at least four other African nations have intervened against them. All four accuse Uganda and Rwanda of invading another sovereign nation. **********As diplomats around the world worry that a full-scale regional war is boiling over in Africa, Uganda protests that this is a war it did not want but has been unable to avoid. **********''We are not there voluntarily,'' said Amama Mbabazi, the Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of regional cooperation. ''We are forced by circumstances to be there.'' He said that relations between Uganda and Congo had been souring because Mr. Kabila did not control rebels who initiate attacks into Uganda from the other side of the Congo border. Since last spring, 1,500 Ugandan troops have been stationed inside Congo, flushing out these fighters with the help of Congolese soldiers. **********In August, Mr. Mbabazi said, those same Congolese soldiers started the rebellion against Mr. Kabila. **********''When they mutinied, what could we do?'' Mr. Mbabazi asked. ''Either we had to continue with them or maybe fight them.'' **********Critics of Mr. Museveni, and many admirers, say this is not the whole story. But many outside officials and experts says Rwanda was the prime mover behind the rebellion because of its own deeper border worries, in which the forces that carried out the 1994 mass killings there have been launching their own attacks from Congo into Rwanda. **********Uganda, under this theory, went along with the rebellion because it thought Mr. Kabila would fall easily. He did not, largely because Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad rushed to his defense. **********Two questions muddy Uganda's protests that its involvement in Congo is limited and reluctant. The first is the extent to which its well-trained and disciplined army is actually fighting the war. The second is how much Uganda's commercial interests, which have grown since Mr. Kabila came to power, play a role. **********Neither question can be answered with certainty. On the issue of fighting, outside experts are divided as to whether Ugandans are the main force pushing in the northwest along the Congo River toward the capital, Kinshasa, or whether their role is merely advisory. **********There have been no reports of Ugandan soldiers dying in Congo. But there are thousands of Ugandan soldiers in Congo, perhaps 6,000 or more, and there is much speculation that Uganda helped create a second rebel force northwest of here led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, the son of one of Congo's richest men. Uganda says its troops only operate in the same areas as Mr. Bemba, but they do not seem to have made any efforts to stop him. **********The question of commercial interests is complicated because of Congo's great wealth in natural resources and the assumption that every outside force is fighting for some piece. During the last several years, Ugandan traders have opened up a growing market in eastern Congo, selling beer, soap, salt and household goods. But the charges that some in Uganda are happy to fight the war because it opens up the path to gold and diamonds are raising more questions for Mr. Museveni. **********In September, a plane crashed in the Ruwenzori mountains, along the two countries' mutual border, carrying a Ugandan colonel, several gold traders and business associates of Mr. Museveni's brother, Salim Saleh, a general in the Ugandan Army. **********Here in Kisangani, diamond traders described a Belgian buyer named Filippe, who has visited at least twice since August, demanding low prices as one of the few foreigners in town. Elumbu Kalokola Kennedy, the president of the dealers' association and a supporter of the rebellion, said the assumption is that Filippe operates on behalf of Ugandan business interests. **********Whatever Uganda's mix of interests, the soldiers themselves are popular here, though the rebellion itself is not. For all the hostility to Rwandan soldiers, whom local residents accuse of looting and killings here during the last rebellion, Ugandan soldiers are regarded as polite and well behaved. They pay their hotel bills, while the Palm Beach Hotel here is still trying to collect $75,000 from the Congolese rebels. **********But people say that with all Congo  has to offer, they doubt that anyone's motives are pure. Congo, said Louis Kembo, 42, a businessman here, is ''very rich.'' **********''Once you taste it, you find it is very nice,'' he said. ''You can't leave it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/18/business/personal-business-a-blizzard-in-florida.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Blizzard in Florida", "print_headline": "PERSONAL BUSINESS; A Blizzard in Florida", "body_text": " **********Employees can come up with the darnedest excuses for returning to work a day or two late from vacations and long weekends: A car breakdown.

Payson, the doctor named to take the reins of Oxford Health Plans, has begun to outline to employees a strategy to turn around the troubled managed care company. The plan includes overhauling the company's systems and tightening controls. **********But any turnaround plan hinges on the success of the company's effort to sell $350 million of debt over the next few months. Oxford could begin approaching investors as soon as next week about participating in a private placement of high-yield bonds, according to people who have been briefed on the company's plans. **********The debt financing, which accounts for half the $700 million in capital Oxford plans to raise, is critical to the company's future. The $350 million in equity financing from Texas Pacific Group, a private investment firm, is contingent on the company's ability to raise the debt, and Dr. Payson, who is technically serving as a consultant to the company, is to become chief executive only when the financing is completed. **********The company expects to offer a mixture of senior secured notes and unsecured high-yield bonds to large investors like insurance companies and mutual funds. Oxford has already received commitments from some investors to buy about $150 million in senior notes, according to people briefed about the financing, but must still find buyers for the remainder of the debt. **********Making the sale may not be easy, given the company's problems over the last year. In 1997, Oxford lost $291 million and is not expected to return to profitability this year. The company is expected to announce its first-quarter results soon. **********''Whenever a company is in a turnaround situation, going to the capital markets is a more complicated situation,'' said Arun Kumar, a director for Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency based in New York. **********Last November, just as Oxford's troubles started to appear, Standard & Poor's looked at the company's New York subsidiary, which accounts for about three-quarters of Oxford's business. Based on the information that was public at the time, S.& P. gave the outfit a B rating, a low,  noninvestment-grade rating given to groups with ''vulnerable financial security.'' **********Still, no publicly traded security of Oxford has ever been evaluated by a credit rating agency, and the deal has not yet been priced. **********''The transaction continues to move forward, and we expect to close in the second quarter,'' said Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Texas Pacific. **********Dr. Payson declined to be interviewed until the financing was complete. But he  has been outlining a turnaround strategy to employees and benefits consultants, according to people who have heard his plans and The Oxford Bulletin, a publication Oxford sends to consultants and others. The plan includes bringing in a new management team. **********With the exception of William Sullivan, the company's former chief executive, and Jeffrey H. Boyd, the general counsel, all the top executives who were present when Oxford first stumbled have left the company. **********In addition to hiring Marvin Rich, the managed care executive who helped with a turnaround at Kmart, to oversee Oxford's operations, Dr. Payson has named Alan Muney, a doctor who used to head medical affairs for Avanti Health Systems, as the company's chief medical officer. Additional announcements are expected, including a permanent chief financial officer. **********Dr. Payson is also trying to make peace with Oxford's doctors, many of whom are frustrated because they say that they are still unpaid after Oxford fell months behind in paying claims last year. At the end of February, the company owed about $60 million to New York doctors and hospitals in claims more than 30 days old, according to the New York Attorney General's office, which acknowledged that the company is making progress in catching up. **********Dr. Payson is also making the rounds. According to The Oxford Bulletin, he has met with leaders at more than 50 partnerships, representing some 2,000 doctors, and 8 hospitals. Oxford has also had discussions with the New York County Medical Society, the group that represents 5,000 Manhattan doctors, which is seeking to bring legal arbitration against the company. **********Oxford's success with the doctors will largely depend on whether it can clean up its old bills and pay doctors on time. Oxford has been actively negotiating with doctors and hospitals to settle claims, and the company says that it continues to pay its bills more promptly. But Dr. Payson conceded in the bulletin that the company was a long way from being able to claim success. ''Recent upgrades to our claims payment processes have improved current claim throughput,'' he said, ''but there is still much hard work ahead of us.'' **********Indeed, there are no quick fixes to the company's computer system, which Oxford executives have long blamed for the bulk of the company's problems. The company has indicated that it plans to replace its system with a new one but has not said how much such a system could cost. **********Under Dr. Payson, Oxford will also focus more on the fundamentals of managed care. ''They really want to look at how they manage medical costs,'' said Marc Gouran, a group president of Solomon-Page Group, an executive search firm. Having focused mainly on negotiating discounted fees from hospitals and doctors, Oxford intends to monitor more closely the care being delivered, questioning such things as the length of hospital stays, and review the contracts it has with its providers. **********As it begins to be more heavy- handed with its doctors and hospitals, Oxford is also looking hard at the profitability of the coverage it offers. In its core commercial business, the company is expected to raise its premiums next year for many groups and shun those groups where it believes it will lose money. **********Oxford is also trying to stem the losses from some of its government programs, leaving the Medicaid market in some states and shifting more of the risk to hospitals and doctors in some areas where it offers Medicare coverage. In New York, the company was denied a rate increase for individuals this year, but the State Insurance Department is allowing Oxford to use some of the money from a special pool to offset some of the losses the company says it has incurred by providing the coverage. **********While talking about his plans for Oxford, Dr. Payson has also emphasized that he wants to retain the flexibility and innovative thinking that has made Oxford one of the New York region's most popular managed care plans. He must now prove Oxford can be profitable doing it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/01/business/an-on-line-critic-tackles-the-big-papers.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Napoli", "pub_date": "1998-06-01", "snippet": "Scott Shuger does daily analysis of articles in nation's major daily newspapers, and analysis, called Today's Papers, is sent to 20,000 subscribers of electronic magazine Slate; Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate, says Shuger hopes to educate people...", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An On-Line Critic Tackles the Big Papers", "print_headline": "An On-Line Critic Tackles the Big Papers", "body_text": " **********Scott Shuger is paid to do what most readers do free: rant about -- and at -- the nation's major daily newspapers.

The fact of the matter is you don't get everything you need from every one of them. USA Today is the least affected of the papers; it doesn't write for the people who fly business class. It doesn't have the class or money orientation. This is probably one of my most politically incorrect judgments, but I think it's an effective national newspaper. It has something that I'd love to see the other papers pick up on: the routinization of the news. The press is too crisis-oriented, the stories too breathless. **********Patterns in the way articles are displayed. **********I don't think the patterns are hard and fast. Some of the differences are clearer than others. USA Today is very good expository reporting, more of a briefing paper. It's rare you pick up a story and don't know what happened. There are many times I've read a New York Times story where sometimes they're so strong in explanation and context that you actually lose sight of what happened. It's like a wealth of information. **********That's not the same as burying its lead. The L.A. Times tends to bury its leads. I am likely to go much deeper into an L.A. Times story without knowing what the point of it is. **********Ten years ago I would have said The Washington Post was demonstrably stronger on domestic political angles. Now, The New York Times Washington bureau has gotten hip to the nuances of D.C. The L.A. Times, in political stories, isn't much behind. It weaves domestic political elements pretty effectively. **********Why he feels he is qualified to critique daily newspapers. **********I've never worked for a daily newspaper. I was on a paper in high school. I used to be in the military, an intelligence officer in the Navy. I had a good job -- I didn't get killed and I learned a lot. I served in aviation, on a carrier overseas. People say you have no idea what the pressures are on a daily reporter. I say I used to brief admirals. **********What readers say. **********As soon as I heard the idea for this column, I thought of the morning briefing prepared by the staff in the Pentagon. I knew people would want it if it was done well. There's a base motive: people like to see the media brought down. **********Readers do really feel like communicating. I've always found letters really interesting. I love knowing the readers can click on my name and send me mail. If people write me and they've not understood me, I feel this tremendous need to take the time to explain it to them. A lot of people define things left, right, liberal.

Chides Funds On Information", "body_text": " **********Mutual fund investors, blinded by stunning investment returns the last several years, are not getting enough information about how much they are paying for a fund company's services, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said today. **********In an address to the annual meeting of the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, Mr. Levitt called on fund companies to temper their promotion of investment performance by explaining ''clearly and unequivocally'' how fees and expenses affect small investors and what risks they face if the financial markets decline. **********Mr. Levitt's prodding of the fund industry on the issue of costs comes as the financial services business is undergoing rapid consolidation. Banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial institutions are rushing to combine their operations in the belief that greater size brings economies of scale and lower costs. **********But executives in the mutual fund industry, which has grown to its current $5 trillion in assets from $1 trillion at the beginning of the 1990's, have consistently rejected that argument, saying that the industry's growth has brought with it demands by investors for more products and services. **********Mr. Levitt said he did not intend to tell fund companies how much to charge. ''But I'm concerned that investors are ignorant about expenses and fees,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''You've got to do a better job of making sure that those who sell funds also explain the costs of investing.'' **********A recent survey conducted by the commission showed that fewer than half of mutual fund investors know that fund expenses are deducted from a fund on an continuing basis, Mr. Levitt said. And only 8 percent say they completely understand the expenses that their funds charge, he said. **********''Financial illiteracy is very troubling in an era when workers are shouldering a significant portion of their retirement planning through 401(k) plans and I.R.A.'s,'' he said. **********Mr. Levitt's suggestions for improving disclosure drew a cool reception from some fund industry executives. ''I think they are all things that the industry is already doing,'' said Don Powell, chairman of Van Kampen American Capital, a mutual fund subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, and chairman of the industry trade group. **********Fund expenses vary widely based on a fund's investment objective. According to Strategic Insight, a New York fund research company, the average annual expense ratio of equity funds range from 1 percent of assets for growth and income funds to 1.6 percent of assets for international stock funds. Generally, the expense ratio of smaller funds is higher than for larger funds, because the costs of big funds are spread over more investors. **********According to some studies, the average expense ratio has been rising the last few years. Industry executives argue that statistic is misleading, however, because it includes more small, young funds that have been started up as the industry has boomed. **********But Mr. Levitt did not stop with the issue of expenses. He also chastised fund industry executives for hesitating to follow the commission's guidelines for simplifying fund prospectuses. **********Earlier this year, the S.E.C. approved new measures intended to make fund documents more understandable to the average investor, including allowing the use of a shortened, three-  to six-page version of the more detailed prospectus to sell fund shares. A full prospectus must then be delivered to the customer with confirmation of the order. **********''A number of funds have heeded our call for better communication,'' Mr. Levitt said. **********He added, however: ''We're chagrined to hear that some of you intend to make only a few cosmetic changes and mostly leave your prospectuses as they are -- the same dense, legalistic presentations that investors don't want, don't understand and don't read. In our book, that merits a failing grade.'' **********Fund companies have not entirely rejected the S.E.C.'s proposals to simplify documents, some industry executives say. Rather, they are trying to square them with demands from many investors for more information. **********''Fund companies are struggling with how much detail should we get into,'' said Paul G. Haaga Jr., an executive vice president of Capital Research and Management, which manages the American Funds. ''I think investors get a great amount of accurate detail about fees. The question is how does an investor use that information to then make a decision.'' **********Mr. Levitt also called on mutual fund directors to be more vigilant about oversight of fund companies, questioning fees and otherwise watching out for the interest of fund shareholders. **********The commission will hold a round table on fund governance this fall, he said, to discuss the role of independent fund directors in hiring and dismissing portfolio managers, monitoring the fees that investors pay to fund managers and otherwise acting as watchdogs for fund shareholders. **********''Everyone knows that the fund director is the shareholder's representative,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''But the proper role of a fund's board has become a bit controversial lately.'' **********The commission itself has added to the controversy. Last year, the commission accused two outside directors of the Parnassus fund as well as the fund manager of securities law violations. The charges, which the Parnassus fund and the directors are contesting, contend that the directors failed to monitor the fund manager's use of benefits that should have gone to the fund."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/25/business/international-business-opec-reaches-new-deal-to-cut-oil-production.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-06-25", "snippet": "Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announces plan to reduce its oil production by more than 1.3 million barrels a day, or nearly 5 percent, in latest attempt to push up prices; members of OPEC and other producers have been facing severe...", "word_count": 1126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPEC Reaches New Deal to Cut Oil Production", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; OPEC Reaches New Deal to Cut Oil Production", "body_text": " **********Overcoming a serious political dispute that split the Iranian delegation and threatened the final agreement, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced late today that it planned to reduce its oil production by more than 1.3 million barrels a day, or nearly 5 percent, in the latest attempt to push up prices. **********The 11 members of OPEC and other producers have been facing a severe crisis since oil prices began a sharp decline in November, falling below $12 a barrel last week to the lowest level in more than a decade. Two earlier moves to reduce production, including sharp cutbacks pledged in March, have largely failed to keep prices from dropping. **********The much-anticipated agreement was announced here at the meeting of OPEC oil ministers near the close of the commodity markets in New York today. The dispute among the Iranians had sent oil prices dropping during the day, wiping out an early rally in European markets after reports that a deal was imminent. But prices ended little changed, with crude oil for August delivery settling up 8 cents, at $14.60 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. **********The Iranian split, as well as OPEC's reputation for being unable to maintain production cutbacks, left some experts questioning how long the agreement would hold. ''It is a fragile agreement by its very nature, as it depends on the pledge of each country to cut its production,'' said Fadhil al-Chalabi, a former OPEC under secretary. He added that some countries might again be tempted to increase production if prices rise. **********The deal was nearly scuttled early this evening, shortly before it was first to have been announced, when the Iranian oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, who represents the moderate views of President Mohammed Khatami, engaged in a public dispute with Kazempour Ardebili, a senior figure in the Iranian leadership who tends to reflect the views of the Revolutionary Guards and other hard-liners. **********The two officials argued loudly over who had the authority to speak for Iran during the final negotiations over the production accord. Several OPEC oil ministers who attended that meeting said privately afterward that they feared the dispute would deflate any rally in oil prices the agreement might otherwise have brought. **********At one point during the session, according to several officials who were present, Nigeria's oil minister, Dan Etete, raised his walking stick in anger at the two Iranians, proclaiming, ''This is no way to do business.'' **********In the end, the Iranians and several oil ministers stormed out of the closed-door meeting, and OPEC was forced to delay the announcement of the agreement. **********''When a senior member of the Iranian delegation disagrees with his minister publicly, it poses a big question mark about what is happening there,'' a senior Arab delegate said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Can you imagine what it would be like if in our delegation the minister and the deputy minister argued over who speaks for the country?'' **********But other officials said there were some benefits from bringing the Iranian dispute out into the open. ''It is good that a misunderstanding has been aired here because last time when we here in March, we left with two different Iranian interpretations of a deal,'' said Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's former oil minister, who is a senior adviser to his country's OPEC delegation. ''This time, we are all clear as to where Iran stands.'' **********By agreeing this time to cut their daily output by 1.3 million barrels, the 11 members of OPEC have pledged since March to remove a daily total of about 2.6 million barrels from the market. **********If OPEC, which controls about 40 percent of the world's oil production, can live up to those commitments, it could significantly reduce the excess supplies of crude oil that have sent prices plunging. But too often, oil producers both in and outside OPEC have failed to meet all their pledges. **********Late in March, for instance, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, with Mexico helping as intermediary, led a coalition of oil exporters that agreed to cut oil output by 1.7 million barrels a day. But fewer than one million barrels are estimated to have actually been taken out of production, and oil prices, which initially rallied, resumed their decline. **********Earlier this month, a number of these countries agreed to cut a further total of 740,000 barrels, starting on July 1. **********The production cutbacks announced by OPEC today will expand on the reductions planned for July 1 by more than 600,000 barrels a day. **********The biggest sacrifice in production is to come from Saudi Arabia, which plans to reduce its output by 425,000 barrels daily. Venezuela promised to cut its oil output by 325,000 barrels, and the United Arab Emirates by 100,000 barrels a day. **********After much negotiation, Iran agreed to lower its production by 65,000 barrels a day instead of OPEC's request for a 95,000-barrel cutback. Mr. Ardebili, who is an adviser to Iran's Foreign Minister and the oil minister as well as Iran's governor on the OPEC board, insisted on the smaller cut, saying this quantity was what the Government had authorized. But Mr. Namdar-Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, said he would agree to a larger cut. **********A senior Arab official said the differences in these Iranian positions reflected concerns over the rising production of oil by Iraq, Iran's rival and its wartime enemy in the 1980's. Over the last year, the Iraqi Government of President Saddam Hussein has raised its production of oil with United Nations permission to 2.2 million barrels a day, of which it exports 1.7 million barrels, crowding Iranian and Saudi sales. **********It does so under an oil-for-food agreement worked out with the United Nations, and if its production should continue to expand, the Iraqis might reclaim their old position as OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, passing the Iranians. **********For that reason, the hard-liners in Teheran have insisted on giving as little as possible. But President Khatami's Government, which is eager to improve ties with the rest of the world, has insisted on more cooperation. Both tendencies are represented in Iran's OPEC delegation. **********A number of non-OPEC countries that attended the meeting as observers, including representatives of Mexico, Russia, Norway and Oman, have made some production cuts themselves. **********Mexico, which reduced its output by 100,000 barrels a day at the beginning of April, plans to cut another 100,000 in July. **********But Norway, which has cut 100,000 barrels a day, has no plans for further reductions. Russia pledged reductions this year of 80,000 barrels daily, and Oman offered a 50,000- barrel-a-day cut. **********OPEC officials acknowledged that it would take a while for the market to verify that these pledges had been carried out. **********And, there is concern here that the Asian economic crisis, which has removed about one million barrels a day in demand, could grow worse, making further production cuts necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/28/world/india-s-confident-leader-faces-a-key-vote-today.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1998-03-28", "snippet": "Prime Min Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India strengthens his week-old Hindu nationalist coalition by assuring Indians that policies will not depart from those of previous governments; nationalists are expected to have trouble holding coalition together...", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India's Confident Leader Faces a Key Vote Today", "print_headline": "India's Confident Leader Faces a Key Vote Today", "body_text": " **********Despite the inherent fragility of their 19-party coalition, a week in office has been enough for the Hindu nationalists who lead India's new Government to fend off threats of a repetition of their humiliation in 1996, when the nationalists' first bid to govern collapsed in 13 days. **********Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the nationalists' leader, has presided over a stream of policy pronouncements aimed at reassuring Indians that there will be no radical departures from the policies of previous governments. In addition, Mr. Vajpayee's lieutenants have maneuvered to head off a repeat of the 1996 events, when the nationalists -- unable to round up support from other parties -- quit ahead of certain defeat in Parliament. **********Mr. Vajpayee, 72, has been a different man in Parliament this week  from the disconsolate figure he cut two years ago. With party tallies today showing that his Government was virtually certain to survive a crucial confidence vote in Parliament on Saturday, he used one of India's popular cricket analogies, comparing his fate in 1996 to that of a batsman who quit even before ''the umpire raised his finger'' to dismiss him. **********''But this time we have a majority, and we will prove it,'' he said. **********Opposition leaders have conceded privately that India seems set for at least a few months under the nationalists and their allies, longer if they succeed in efforts to broaden their coalition. But while many Indians are relieved that the nationalists have set aside divisive campaign pledges that had caused deep anxieties among India's Muslim minority, few believe that Mr. Vajpayee is likely to achieve the main goal he has set since taking office: providing stable government to a country that has had four Governments and five Prime Ministers in 22 months. **********This time, Mr. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party entered the parliamentary confidence debate with the opposition parties in disarray. Too deeply divided to forge a coalition of their own, the Congress Party and the United Front -- a grouping of leftist and regional parties -- appear to have reconciled themselves to remaining on the opposition benches, while hoping that personal and doctrinal differences within the Vajpayee coalition will eventually bring its collapse. **********The prospects of a quick defeat for the new Government vanished when a key component of the United Front, with 12 members of Parliament from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, quit the front and declared itself neutral in the confidence debate. With the front split, independent tallies indicated that the Government was likely to win the confidence vote by 10 votes or more. **********Over the longer term, it seems certain that the nationalists will have trouble holding the coalition together. **********In the confidence debate, they were repeatedly chided by opposition speakers for joining with groups that have been bitter critics of the nationalists in the past, and of each other. **********Somnath Chatterjee, a leading Communist member of Parliament, recalled that one partner had called another a ''pathological liar'' in 1996, and chuckled.

But it is far from sure that they can stick to Mr. Vajpayee's pledge to offer ''genuine secularism,'' a phrase understood by most Indians to mean government that is evenhanded toward the country's many cultural, language and religious groups. **********For the moment, few Indians expect the hard-liners to follow through on threats to mount protests if Mr. Vajpayee sticks to the vow the Government has made to set aside the most controversial of the nationalists' campaign pledges, to build a Hindu temple on the site of a 16th-century mosque that was destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992. But some Indians think the real test of Mr. Vajpayee's commitment may come in more subtle ways; one would be the fashion in which law enforcement agencies react if Hindu-Muslim frictions of the kind that have caused more than 8,000 riots since 1947 should recur. **********In its early days, the Vajpayee Government has seemed intent on emphasizing its moderation. After an initial flurry last week when the coalition partners announced that they would ''induct nuclear weapons'' into the country's military arsenal, the new defense minister, George Fernandes, has said that no decision will be made until after a full defense review. **********Even then, Mr. Fernandes has said, India may or may not choose to become a declared nuclear-weapons power."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/12/world/russia-vows-to-push-pact-cutting-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1998-03-12", "snippet": "Prime Min Viktor S Chernomyrdin says Russia will push to ratify second strategic arms reduction treaty in order to prepare way for Pres Clinton to visit Moscow for summit meeting by middle of year (M)", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia Vows To Push Pact Cutting Arms", "print_headline": "Russia Vows To Push Pact Cutting Arms", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia said today that his Government would push to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty in order to prepare the way for President Clinton to visit Moscow for a summit meeting by the middle of the year. **********The Clinton Administration has quietly made a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin conditional on Russian passage of Start II, senior Administration officials say. Start II would cut each side's existing levels of warheads by two-thirds. **********The treaty, negotiated by President Bush at the end of his term and signed by him and Mr. Yeltsin in early 1993, was approved by the Senate in January 1996. But Mr. Yeltsin has never pressed for its passage in the Russian Parliament, apparently believing that the political cost of winning would be too high. **********American critics of NATO expansion, which the Senate is expected to approve later this month, have argued that the Russian Parliament has refused to ratify Start II out of anger about NATO's move to the east. Clinton officials are eager to get the arms pact passed, in part to answer those critics and to move toward deeper cuts in a Start III agreement, which Mr. Yeltsin also favors. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin appeared with Vice President Al Gore at a joint news conference today concluding the Washington meetings of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which in semi-annual meetings over the last five years has become the main venue for some of the most difficult issues in United States-Russian relations. American officials in the audience said they were very pleased to hear Mr. Chernomyrdin himself make the connection between a summit meeting, which Mr. Yeltsin wants, and Start II approval. **********Mr. Gore also announced a new joint commission of experts to discuss and monitor the export of sensitive nuclear and missile technologies. The United States and Israel have accused Russian companies of helping Iran develop strategic missiles that could hit Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Israel. **********After originally denying such assistance, Moscow then denied an official connection to any assistance, which would break its commitments under an agreement to control missile exports. American diplomats have been pressing Moscow to stop any such aid, even from privatized companies, and the Russians recently issued a decree announcing new export controls. **********The new controls, known as ''catch-all controls,'' are designed to ban the export of goods that could be used by another country to develop weapons of mass destruction or prohibited delivery systems. **********But as Mr. Gore said today, ''Implementation is key.'' **********''By working together on export controls on weapons, weapons materials and dual-use goods,'' Mr. Gore continued, ''I believe we can -- and will -- strengthen existing international nonproliferation regimes and promote regional stability.'' **********American officials said the new team would help Washington monitor Russian compliance with its pledges and help the Russians with equipment and technology to improve their export controls. **********Administration officials are trying to dissuade the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, from putting forward a bill that would sanction Russian companies that aid Iran's missile programs by banning them from any work on the joint American-Russian international space station. The bill has already passed the House. **********During the two days of meetings with Mr. Gore, Mr. Chernomyrdin reaffirmed a 1995 Russian pledge to have no further nuclear cooperation with Iran while work continued on a Russian nuclear reactor being built, slowly and against American advice, in the city of Bushehr. The Russians have a contract to build one reactor there, and some Russian offficials indicate an interest in building more. **********American officials have tried to block that construction, convincing the Germans, who began the project in the 1970's, not to give the blueprints to the Russians and, last week, getting Ukraine to refuse to supply specialized turbines for the reactor. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Gore spent most of their news conference praising each other and their commission. In meetings between Cabinet secretaries, agreements have been reached on everything from energy issues to health care. **********For example, Conoco Inc. announced tentative agreement today with Russia's largest oil compnay, Lukoil, for joint development of oil reserves in the northern Arctic. The agreement, which is subject to approval by the Russian Government and Parliament, would give Conoco 40 percent of the venture and Lukoil 60 percent. It has been long stalled, and American officials pressed for the agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/21/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-21", "snippet": "Japanese yen gains again after leading aspirants for Prime Minister say they will intensify efforts to end nation's recession; dollar falls to 138.88 yen in New York from 139.47; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********YEN RISES FOR THIRD DAY.

His Internet-derived collection of haiku-like verse inspired by Spam, the popular processed-pork product, is the sole listing under the subject heading ''Canned meat -- poetry.'' **********With the deaths last year of the Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, Mr. Cho crowed, ''I'm the first in a generation of 'meat poets.' '' **********For ''Spam-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf'' (88 pp., HarperCollins, $7.95), Mr. Cho sliced 162 prime examples of porcine poetry out of the Spam Haiku Archive (pemtropics.mit.edu/jcho/spam), a Web site he launched as a lark in June 1995. To date, about 1,500 on-line poets have submitted more than 11,000 entries to the site. All refer in some manner to the rosy-toned Hormel Foods product, and most follow the three-line, 5-7-5 pattern of syllables that schoolchildren learn is the classic haiku form. The Spam-ku range from earnest, often ham-fisted efforts at evoking a mood, such as Mr. Cho's ''The first time we kissed:/ Your cheeks flushed a deep Spam pink,/ Your lips soft, hungry'' to such swinishly punny entries as Chris Fishel's ''Descartes on pig parts/ Says: I'm pink, therefore I'm Spam/ Deep philosophy.'' **********Mr. Cho, a 34-year-old research scientist at M.I.T., attributes part of Spam-ku's popularity to the simple fact that it is a short, silly-sounding word. ''It's hard to compose haiku about Vienna sausage or Canadian bacon,'' Mr. Cho said. ''They take up too many syllables. He said that contributors liked to play with the tension between the nostalgia invoked by Spam's rich history -- introduced in 1937, it was a staple of many wartime diets -- and its anachronistic status today as processed pork in a fresh-meat era. **********More than anything, though, Spam-ku are easy to compose, an appealing ingredient for those taking advantage of the Web's self-publishing capabilities. Mr. Cho's site also contains an area for haiku about news events, and earlier this year the Salon (www.salonmagazine.com), the on-line magazine, held a competition for haiku error messages. **********''American poetry in the 20th Century has become pretty intimidating,'' Mr. Cho said. ''Both rhyme and meter have gone out of fashion, and people find it hard to understand what poetry is and how to write it. Here, you have a very simple structure that anyone can follow -- although you'd be surprised how many entries I get that miss the syllable count.'' **********Francis Heaney has written about 230 Spam-ku for the archive. ''They're not all gems,'' Mr. Heaney conceded. His favorite -- ''Moon rises,/ White as two slices of bread,/ Sunset pink as Spam within'' -- did not make it into Mr. Cho's book. **********Although he has since abandoned the form, Mr. Heaney, a 28-year-old puzzle writer and editor in Manhattan, said, ''I do my best writing under constraints, so the constraint of a haiku, plus the fact that it has to be about Spam, is very limiting. To do things within that is fun.'' **********Because haiku almost always involves nature, Mr. Heaney sought to incorporate that element into his poems. Would that requirement be fulfilled by a reference to Spam alone? ''It's made out of pigs,'' Mr. Heaney replied. ''I guess pigs are natural.'' **********Another entry that did not make it into the book was this candidate from Alex Dunne: ''Spam's own irony/ Is that its haiku's never/ Worse than Spam itself.'' **********Haiku experts are skeptical about the new form. ''It's technically not poetry,'' said Lee Gurga, a dentist from Lincoln, Ill., who recently served as president of the Haiku Society of America (www.octet. com/hsa/). ''Spam haiku makes statements; statements are not the same as images.'' **********Despite Mr. Cho's claims to the contrary, Dr. Gurga said, the archive entries are not ''senryu'' either. ''Senryu have to do with human nature, and they can be very funny, but they tend to have a little more resonance than Spam.'' Ultimately, Dr. Gurga said, Spam-ku ''doesn't bother me in the least,'' adding, ''I like it when people have fun.'' **********And Dr. Gurga said he hoped that the archive would lead visitors to more serious haiku sites on the Internet. Well-regarded examples include Dhugal J. Lindsay's Haiku Universe (www2.ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dhugal/haikuhome.html) and the Shiki Internet Haiku Salon (cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/shiki). **********Mr. Cho's slim volume represents a burgeoning breed of books that were sired in cyberspace. Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, who edited ''Spam-ku'' for HarperCollins and has published a compendium of martini recipes siphoned from a Web site, approached Mr. Cho after stumbling upon his archive. **********Mr. Ruby-Strauss, who uses an unopened can of Spam as a paperweight, said he had seen Spam-ku swapped with gusto elsewhere on the Net. ''Here's a product that's been marketed,'' Mr. Ruby-Strauss said of Spam, but there was no literary product. ''So let's make a product.'' **********At his publisher's insistence, Mr. Cho sent his selections to Hormel at its headquarters in Austin, Minn., for approval. He omitted those he feared might raise objections. **********For the most part, Mr. Cho said, ''They just wanted all the capitalizations right and for some strange reason, they said no possessives.'' **********The book's illustrations received the toughest inspection. One that showed a mouse sniffing at a tin of Spam was rejected by the company. **********''They said, 'Please, no rodents associated with Spam,' '' Mr. Cho recalled. ''We just decided to can that one.'' **********Hormel officials declined to comment, but the company does maintain a tongue-in-cheek Web site for its product (www.spam.com). **********In addition to offering a Spam mouse pad for sale, the site contains a dissertation that strives to distance the company from ''spam,'' Internet slang for unsolicited E-mail. The term was derived from a Monty Python comedy routine in which the word is repeated ad nauseum. **********A few weeks ago, at the bidding of a friend's daughter who enjoyed the book and wanted to sample its salty, spicy subject, Mr. Cho consumed Spam for the first time in nearly 20 years. Despite his seven-syllable description of the sensation -- an ''elastic, rubbery feel'' -- he said the experience had not prompted him to compose a haiku about the moment. After penning 200 entries for the on-line archive, Mr. Cho lost his appetite for the verse form in early 1996. **********''It was like an addiction,'' he recalled. ''When it was over, it was completely over. I went cold turkey.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/08/business/international-briefs-indonesia-seizes-assets-of-bank-shareholders.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "1998-08-08", "snippet": "Indonesia seizes 'shareholder rights' of four large banks, a sign Government is holding owners of troubled banks responsible for their problems; Government does not name the four banks (S)", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Indonesia Seizes Assets Of Bank Shareholders", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Indonesia Seizes Assets Of Bank Shareholders", "body_text": " **********Indonesia said yesterday that it had seized the ''shareholders rights'' of four large banks, a sign the Government is holding the owners of troubled banks responsible for their problems.

The trade-off -- political stability -- is not quite here yet. And given this nation's history of political turmoil and the mutual animosities of its leaders, a stable Cambodia in the long term would be a surprise. **********On Wednesday, the national election committee announced that the incumbent leader, Hun Sen, had won a majority of the 122 seats in Parliament, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government without forming a coalition with his rivals. Opposition parties are challenging the count and threatening to paralyze the opening of Parliament six weeks from now with a boycott. **********And reports continued to accumulate today of a sort of political cleansing in villages around the country where threats of reprisals are forcing supporters of opposition parties to flee. **********But most political experts predict that after a period of political theater, threats and horse-trading -- and even a possible constitutional crisis --that could last well into the fall, the second-place finisher, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, is likely to join Mr. Hun Sen in some form of coalition. **********''If nothing else, he will be under intense pressure from his party to take a share of the spoils of government,'' a senior aid worker said. ''What's in it for them to stay out in the cold?'' **********That outcome carries its share of irony. After muscling his way into a coalition leadership with Prince Ranariddh after the Prince won the last election, in 1993, Mr. Hun Sen pushed Prince overboard in a coup one year ago and declared, ''I am the only captain of the ship.'' **********The clear domination of Mr. Hun Sen's party this time around, and the weakening of military forces loyal to Prince Ranariddh, may, through force of arms and politics, create a more stable situation than under the dual premiership of the previous Government. **********After the coup last year, Mr. Hun Sen's supporters systematically killed about 100 members of the opposition, monopolized the broadcast media, took control of the mechanisms of the political campaign, intimidated the voters and then invited the Prince to return from exile and take part in a free election. **********Election day, July 26, was an uplifting demonstration of the desire of Cambodians to exercise their mandate, as more than 90 percent of eligible voters crowded into polling places. Foreign election monitors were thrilled. Some called the spectacle ''a miracle.'' **********But many diplomats and aid workers who live here were incensed at this quick-draw assessment. **********''This country has been perpetually in turmoil for the last 30 years,'' a diplomat said. ''It's going to take more than one Sunday of relative peace and quiet to change that. It is incredibly disingenuous and intellectually dishonest as well as possibly immoral for the international community to come in here and say, 'O.K., you have democracy,' when the reality on the ground is much different.'' **********It is impossible to quantify the effects of any threats or manipulation by the governing party. But the picture of voting day that has emerged in reports from Cambodian and foreign observers suggests that a good deal more was going on than was apparent on the surface. **********Voters had already been given the message in the previous weeks and months that there was a right and wrong way to vote. Mr. Hun Sen's party members, who virtually monopolize local and provincial government, had thumb-printed voters, had collected and held their voting cards and had selectively threatened, attacked and sometimes killed villagers who opposed them. **********On voting day, it was those same party functionaries who ran the polling stations, sending a signal that, as one foreign monitor put it, ''we'll still be here tomorrow, and you're still going to have to live with us.'' **********A variety of ballot manipulation was used at the polling stations, said the election monitor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. With a population that is more than 60 percent illiterate, polling station staff marked ballots for many people, the election monitor said. **********They sometimes engaged in a system of ''telegraph'' voting, in which premarked ballots were substituted for clean ones. Once the count was under way, a disproportionate number of opposition ballots were ruled invalid. **********There are unconfirmed allegations of larger-scale manipulation that may have involved the switching of ballot boxes and the massaging of vote totals. **********''I have heard people say that next time they won't vote -- it makes no difference anyway,'' a European diplomat said. ''A lot of people see this election not as a democratic exercise but as a tool by Hun Sen to perpetuate his power. They feel used.'' **********For two years leading up to the 1993 election, the United Nations employed 20,000 foreign aid workers here and spent more than $2 billion in an effort to plant the seeds of democracy in one of the world's most battered and suffering countries. **********The years since then have been a struggle between Cambodia's violent past and the small but growing corps of people who have embraced the United Nations' democratic ideals. The country has a wildly free press -- though journalists are sometimes killed -- and a vigorous sector of private groups focusing on human rights, the rights of women and children, legal reforms, environmental protection and the alleviation of poverty. **********They are the real opposition to Mr. Hun Sen's monopoly of power. **********Now that representatives of other countries have returned briefly, pronounced themselves satisfied and left again, Mr. Hun Sen may feel himself under less pressure to permit this range of democratic activity, said Thomas Hammarberg, the human rights envoy to Cambodia from the United Nations. **********''The nature of the international community is that interest moves from country to country,'' he said.

Sontheimer, a creative electronics engineer and successful entrepreneur who made his most visible contribution to the American economy -- and American kitchens -- after his retirement, died on Monday at a hospital near his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 83 and known as the man who revolutionized American cooking by bringing the Cuisinart to the United States. **********His family said the cause was respiratory failure. **********It's a shudder to think what would have happened -- or not happened -- to American cooking if Mr. Sontheimer had taken up golf. **********There he was in 1971, a 57-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate who had invented an array of technical devices, including a microwave direction finder that went to the moon, and started and sold two electronics companies, giving him the wherewithal to enjoy a well-deserved life of leisure. And he was bored. **********So bored, in fact, that almost as soon as he had sold his last company, Anzac Electronics, in 1966, and completed a three-year consulting contract with the new owner, he had begun casting around for a new venture, among other things considering and rejecting a flier in home security systems. **********Then, drawing on a lifelong passion for French food and French cooking, he decided to try to combine business with pleasure by finding French products suitable for an American franchising operation. **********So Mr. Sontheimer, a native New Yorker who had grown up in France, where his father represented an American company, headed back to France in 1971 with his wife, Shirley, on a scouting trip. **********It was there, at a French cookery show, that he spotted it, an ungainly but versatile machine designed to process food for restaurants. A sort of glorified blender whose multiple attachments allowed it to cut, slice, knead, chop, dice, grate, grind or even blend, it had been manufactured by a French restaurant supply giant, Robot-Coupe, for eight years, but Mr. Sontheimer immediately saw its possibilities for the home kitchen, specifically his. **********As he told his wife, the machine would be ideal for making quenelles, those French delicacies whose meat or fish bases had to be chopped to a fare-thee-well, then laboriously forced through a sieve to achieve the proper consistency. **********Moving swiftly, Mr. Sontheimer and his wife concluded an agreement to distribute a modified version of the commercial machine in the United States, then came up with the name that would soon become a household word. **********''He always thought of French cooking as an art and he wanted it to be based on the word, 'cuisine,' '' his wife said yesterday in explaining how they had come up with Cuisinart. **********It was not until January 1973 that the Cuisinart was introduced at a show in Chicago, and for all its French lineage, the product had more than just an American touch. No wonder. Mr. Sontheimer had spent more than a year modifying virtually every component. **********But then Mr. Sontheimer was never one to leave well enough alone, especially when it came to food. There was the time, for example, when he suffered such cuisine shock eating the food at his M.I.T. fraternity after years of fine dining in France that he went into the kitchen to help put things right. **********He continued his interest in cooking throughout his varied career, which included stints with RCA and Maguire Industries before he founded the forerunner of Trak Electronics in 1947 and then, after selling his Trak stake in 1960, establishing Anzac to develop and manufacture precision microwave systems. **********Along the way he studied French cooking in New York and became friends with James Beard, the enormous cooking master he only occasionally resembled. At a bit more than 6 feet tall, Mr. Sontheimer would periodically trim down to portly. **********For all the Sontheimer improvements, the expensive Cuisinart sold sluggishly until 1975 when a rave review in Gourmet magazine and endorsements from Mr. Beard and others touched off a stampede of sales and created a new industry. **********As Cuisinart sales soared, a host of competitors offered similar food processors, but although the clones were generally much less expensive, Cuisinart's acknowleded edge in quality, a Sontheimer obsession, led to a marketing anomaly in which the most expensive machine was the biggest seller. **********The road to Cuisinart success was not always smooth. After winning permission from Robot-Coupe to use other suppliers, for example, Mr. Sontheimer created an improved model and had it manufactured in Japan, a move that led Robot-Coupe to market its own model in the United States, but without success. **********There was also his battle with Zabar's, the Manhattan specialty food store, which sold Cuisinarts at such a deep discount that Mr. Sontheimer cut off the store's supply until his efforts ran afoul of Federal and state laws, leading to a $250,000 fine. **********Partly because of fresh competition from Sunbeam's Oskar and other cheap, miniature processors, Cuisinart's sales declined in the 1980's, but when he and his wife sold the company to an investment group in 1987 the price was $42 million.

A senior Administration official said of the prospect of military action, ''We're focused more on weeks than months or days.'' **********Members of Mr. Clinton's national security team briefed the President later today on their discussion. **********The participants in the meeting included Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen; the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; the Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and the chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill Richardson. They left the White House without deciding on their ultimate course, an Administration spokesman said. **********The White House meeting came as a consensus emerged in the President's national security staff that Iraq would never comply with the United Nations inspectors, and that smart bombs and cruise missiles may be needed to destroy President Hussein's hidden potential to build crude weapons of mass destruction. **********With the White House enveloped in a miasma of sexual and legal scandals, Administration officials said they were painfully aware that they might be accused of using an attack on Iraq as a diversion to sustain political and popular support for an embattled President. But they took pains to point out that the military plans they are weighing were drawn up two months ago, in November, during the last standoff with Iraq over the United Nations inspections. **********The Administration plans to devote next week to convincing skeptical American allies and members of Congress that military action is the only way to stop Iraq from building a biological and chemical arsenal. **********''We have never put the question directly: 'We're going in. Are you with us or not?' '' the National Security Council official said. **********So far, only Britain is clearly supporting a hard line. Seven years after it came together to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait, the international coalition that fought the Persian Gulf war under the United Nations banner has splintered. **********Two United States battle groups in the gulf -- including warships, fighter jets, hundreds of cruise missiles and precision-guided bombs -- will soon be joined by a British battle group. Together they will form the largest military deployment in the region since the gulf war. **********But no other allies are likely to join. Washington is in a poor position to rebuild the worldwide coalition  that it assembled to fight Iraq in 1991. The United States has been politically weakened at the United Nations by its failure to pay its dues, and Russia, France, China and some Arab allies are unlikely to openly support a military attack on Iraq. **********Nonetheless, the momentum propelling the United States toward bombing Iraq appears inexorable. **********Iraq continues to defy the United Nations inspectors who are charged with identifying and helping to eliminate Baghdad's ability to build nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. A senior United Nations official, Richard Spertzel, said on Friday that there was ''tantalizing information'' that Iraq is operating a secret biological weapons plant despite United Nations inspections and in defiance of an international ban. **********The chief of the inspection team, Richard Butler, told the Security Council on Friday that Iraq was continuing to mislead the inspectors. **********Diplomacy, jawboning and continuing economic sanctions have not moved President Hussein. **********Mr. Clinton warned on Wednesday that diplomacy might be approaching a dead end. ''Something is going to have to give here,'' he said. Administration officials strongly suggested that after going an extra mile down this diplomatic route in the coming week, military action might lie at the end of the road. **********The military plans drawn up in November were originally aimed at compelling Baghdad to comply with United Nations' attempts to rid Iraq of its ability to build weapons of mass destruction. But diplomacy and threats have failed to persuade President Hussein to cooperate. **********Now a crucial question for the United States is whether Washington can or should destroy his suspected weapons plants with bombs and missiles -- and whether force will change his behavior, a strategy that has not worked well in the past. **********The commander of United States forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, said two months ago that if called to battle, he would attack ''the things that mean most to Saddam.'' **********The general defined those targets as the forces that ''enable him to inflict the kind of pain he does on his own people and on others in the region.'' He said those forces include the ''Republican Guard units that keep him in power, his own infrastructure and command and control systems,'' and his ability to build and use biological and chemical weapons. That ability is thought to be concealed in dozens of sites, including presidential palaces. **********''The intent is to deny him the capability to continue to threaten his neighbors and his own people and to threaten the world with his capability,'' General Zinni said. **********Three new teams of United Nations technical experts are scheduled to begin a series of meetings in Baghdad on Feb. 1 to weigh Iraq's compliance on missile warhead, germ warfare and chemical weapons issues. The meetings are expected to continue throughout February; it is unclear whether the United States can attack while the teams meet in the Iraqi capital. **********A United States attack on Iraq, Administration officials said, will create more questions: whether to forbid Iraq from flying any planes within its borders and whether to force Iraq to open the suspected weapons sites -- assuming such sites are still standing after what may become the biggest bombing campaign against Iraq since the war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/business/storm-clouds-over-wall-street-investors-long-horizon-mantra-with-chorus-380830.html": {"writer_name": "Dawn Gilbertson", "pub_date": "1998-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Long-Horizon Mantra, With a Chorus of 'Diversify'", "print_headline": "STORM CLOUDS OVER WALL STREET: THE INVESTORS; A Long-Horizon Mantra, With a Chorus of 'Diversify'", "body_text": " **********In light of the market's recent declines,  The New York Times interviewed three families with differing investment philosophies to see what, if any, adjustments they were making.

Given their aggressive saving -- the two have contributed 10 percent of their annual salaries over the last 30 years to their retirement plans -- and the market's great run, Mr. Schechter thinks they are close to their goal, regardless what the market does in the short term. **********Reviewing the Schechters' portfolio, George Toth, a certified financial planner at Chestnut Investment Advisory in Erdenheim, Pa., said the couple did a ''great job'' of accumulating assets through disciplined investing. But he was concerned that they might have too much money in large stocks and large-stock mutual funds, both of which track the market and put them at more risk than they might realize. For diversification, he suggested putting about 15 percent of their retirement money in a convertible bond fund -- at least temporarily. **********Mr. Toth also said the Schechters needed to figure out their downside risk and set price targets for their stocks and funds -- and to get out if those targets were hit. **********Mr. Schechter dismissed the recommendation to diversify (''The economy was built on these large, well-capitalized companies'') and added that he didn't need to set price floors because he's a long-term holder.

Mergers can result in fewer bank branches and fewer bank employees to help smaller businesses. **********But the growing number of these disenfranchised customers represents an opportunity for smaller banks that can offer sophisticated products in combination with caring, personal service. These customers often rely heavily on relationships with specific bank employees who can resolve problems and provide prompt answers. **********For business customers, a good bank means several things: a useful line of products and services at a reasonable cost; prompt responses to loan requests; timely financial solutions and capital, and access to bankers with decision-making power. **********These are the exact qualities that can be  overlooked during and after a bank merger -- especially when the focus and culture of  the merging institutions are different. And that is when smaller business customers can become lost in the shuffle. **********In a recent survey, the Opinion Research Corporation asked senior executives at 225 small- and medium-size companies -- those with revenues of $5 million to $15 million -- to rate their primary bank on how well it  understood their needs. While half of the executives said they were satisfied with their banks' problem-solving ability and convenience, only 38 percent gave the bank high marks as a trusted source of financial advice. In addition, only 46 percent of the executives were extremely satisfied or very satisfied with the attention they had received from their primary bank. **********Many companies just don't feel that they are getting good value in their banking relationships. Midsize banks -- those with $1 billion to $5 billion in assets -- have traditionally been considered too small to offer technically sophisticated products and too  large to provide personal and efficient service. But the new availability and affordability of technology is giving smaller banks a way to offer such products while still providing access to senior managers. **********Consolidation among the bigger players also lets midsize banks contribute more meaningfully to economic growth in their communities. In the New York area, where many new jobs are being created by small-  and middle-market businesses, the flexibility of smaller banks puts them in an ideal  position to supply the capital and services to support growth and neighborhood renewal -- particularly in commercial transactions of $1 million to $10 million. **********Midsize banks are nimbler than larger banks, and can leverage their close-to-the-customer style to introduce new products quickly. They are also adaptable enough to examine opportunities case by case. **********In one instance, my bank uncovered an opportunity to provide financing for properties that were a mix of residential and commercial uses. The need was initially seen by a branch manager who was trying to help a customer finance an unusual property. It didn't fit with our existing menu of financial products, so we created a new one -- a combination residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan -- and got it into the field quickly. **********We applied the same logic in a new portfolio of private banking and investment services that would otherwise be out of the reach of smaller commercial customers. **********The spigot-on, spigot-off approach that many of our bigger competitors apply to  commercial lending has made smaller customers less likely to rely on them for financing. The small size and complex nature of many deals in today's market simply do not whet the appetite of large banks. **********Midsize banks, on the other hand, can be willing and able to fill the widening service gap for small and midsize businesses that are lost in the merger chaos."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/business/company-news-mexican-conglomerate-buys-authentic-specialty-foods.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-05-09", "snippet": "Authentic Specialty Foods Inc to be acquired by Mexican conglomerate Desc SA for $136.4 million (S)", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEXICAN CONGLOMERATE BUYS AUTHENTIC SPECIALTY FOODS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MEXICAN CONGLOMERATE BUYS AUTHENTIC SPECIALTY FOODS", "body_text": " **********Authentic Specialty Foods Inc., a provider of Mexican food products, said yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired by the Mexican conglomerate Desc S.A. for $17 a share, or $136.4 million.

But figuring out whether the power-sharing agreements made by top executives of the merged companies will work is nearly impossible. **********Even the executives who negotiate these arrangements can find them confusing. Charles R. Lee, chairman of GTE, stumbled  last week while trying to explain his arrangement with Ivan G. Seidenberg, chief executive of Bell Atlantic. **********''I will be chairman and chief executive officer of the merged company,'' he said at a news conference, ''and Ivan will be president and co-chief executive officer of the company. I'm a co-chief executive, he's a 'co' -- I think I goofed that up. We're partners, we're two 'co's.' '' **********Mr. Lee can be forgiven his tied tongue.  After all, such marriages of convenience are still a bit new for corporate America. Among the biggest merger deals, hostile takeovers are giving way to so-called mergers of equals, in which the chief executives of the merged companies must, by definition, maintain equal status after their deal. **********Never mind that old-fashioned command-and-control hierarchies still drive the action  at corporate headquarters. These days, sharing is a fashionable term, and chief executives besides Mr. Lee and Mr. Seidenberg are using it often. **********John R. Stafford, chief executive of American Home Products, and Robert B. Shapiro, chief executive of Monsanto, for example, announced such an arrangement in June. And Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Travelers Group, and John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, agreed to share power in their new company, Citigroup. **********But what are the chances that these modern marriages will work? **********Consider, as a baseline, that close to half of all real marriages end in divorce -- and most of them do not start off as marriages of convenience. In corporate weddings of chief executives, the power-sharing agreements are typically just a side effect of getting the deal done, not a result of two executives' seeking each other out because their strengths are complementary. **********EXECUTIVES may have any number of reasons to want to retain the title of chief executive in the new company: protecting their lieutenants in the merged company, making more money or avoiding being seen as a loser in a power struggle. **********''They're trying to solve a social problem,'' said Herbert M. Sandler, the co-chief executive of the Golden West Financial Corporation, the Oakland, Calif.-based parent of World Savings Bank. ''They're not saying, 'That's a guy I'd really like to team up with.' '' **********Mr. Sandler can speak with some authority on the subject. He has shared the title of chief executive with his wife, Marion O. Sandler, since they bought Golden West in 1963. **********Mr. Sandler said that for co-chief arrangements to work, the executives must trust and respect each other, and, most important, have no hidden agendas. ''If it's being driven by other factors, then you're making real compromises, and then there is a high risk that it's not going to work,'' he added. **********Some executives have said they do not think such relationships can work, period. When CUC International merged with HFS Inc. last December, CUC's chairman, Walter A. Forbes, entered into an unusual agreement with Henry R. Silverman, the HFS chairman. Until the year 2000, Mr. Forbes would be chairman of the merged company, the Cendant Corporation, and Mr. Silverman would be chief executive; after that they would switch jobs. Although Mr. Forbes resigned this week over accounting irregularities at the company, he said in an interview earlier this month that they chose the job-trading structure because it would have been unwieldy to have two chief executives making decisions at the same time. **********''We just felt that co-anything is difficult,'' Mr. Forbes said. **********Mr. Lee of GTE and Mr. Seidenberg declined to be interviewed. But Dennis C. Carey, vice chairman for the United States practice of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm that has often worked for GTE, said he believed Mr. Lee and Mr. Seidenberg would develop a productive relationship. Mr. Lee, he said, has long made a habit of sharing decision-making with his top managers at GTE. **********''I have no doubt that Chuck will find this power-sharing arrangement very comfortable,'' Mr. Carey said. ''It's part of his approach to conducting business.'' **********And Mr. Seidenberg, who will become the sole chief executive of the merged company in July 2002 and will replace Mr. Lee as chairman two years later, has already shown that he can wait patiently. He was chairman of Nynex when it merged with Bell Atlantic and agreed then to take a back seat until Raymond W. Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic, stepped aside. **********''This is not a radical departure from what Ivan had already adapted to,'' Mr. Carey said. **********Sometimes, marriages of convenience do work out. Robin H. H. Wilson and Glenn R. Zander were co-chief executives of Trans World Airlines during most of 1993, as it was working its way out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. They were thrown together because they represented two important parties in the bankruptcy -- Mr. Wilson the airline's employees, and Mr. Zander the  creditors. **********As it turned out, their skills fit together nicely: Mr. Wilson had expertise in airline operations and Mr. Zander in finance. **********''In this particular circumstance, this was the right solution,'' Mr. Wilson, who is now managing director of SH & E Inc., a consulting firm, said last week. ''But it does create some particular pressures on individuals to acquire a certain compatibility.'' **********As successful as the executives were in helping T.W.A. emerge from bankruptcy, Mr. Wilson said he would probably not have chosen a co-chief role if he had the chance to do it all over again. **********''A more traditional model would be preferable,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/business/microsoft-has-a-stronghold-in-office-suites.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1998-05-27", "snippet": "Dataquest, market research firm, says that Microsoft Office has 93 percent of world market for collections of business software known as suites; Lotus Smartsuite has 4 percent of market, and Corel Wordperfect Suite has 3 percent; part of states' l...", "word_count": 1281, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Has A Stronghold In Office Suites", "print_headline": "Microsoft Has A Stronghold In Office Suites", "body_text": " **********When employees of the New York Attorney General's office sat down last week to prepare the final draft of the multistate lawsuit  accusing the Microsoft Corporation of monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior, they typed the document using Microsoft Word, the word processor installed on the office's computers as part of a group of business programs known as Office. **********''We have Windows 95 and the Microsoft Office suite,'' Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco acknowledged with a rueful chuckle. **********So does virtually every other office in America, which is one of the reasons that Mr. Vacco and 19 other state Attorneys General have targeted Office in their lawsuit. **********Dataquest, a market research firm, said that Microsoft Office now has 93 percent of the world market for the collections of business software known as suites. The other 7 percent is divided between two other suites built around former industry heavyweights. Lotus Smartsuite, has 4 percent of the market, and Corel Wordperfect Suite has 3 percent. **********In addition to Word, Microsoft Office includes the Excel spreadsheet program for financial analysis and management, and Outlook, a personal information manager for keeping schedules and contact directories. Microsoft offers Office in three versions -- standard, professional and small-business editions. Various versions also include Powerpoint presentation software for developing slide shows on a computer screen; Access, a data-base management tool for finding and analyzing information stored in large computer filing cabinets, or Streets, a mapping and directions program. **********The part of the states' lawsuit dealing with Office accuses Microsoft of using predatory pricing strategies to gain dominance in the market for office suites. **********The Justice Department argues that Microsoft's pricing policy for Office leaves computer manufacturers the practical choice of installing Microsoft's suite on all the computers they make or on none of them. The result, the suit says, is that competition ''is threatened to be curtailed and foreclosed.'' **********But some experts in the industry argue that the states are mounting a battle that may already be lost, since  Microsoft Office already enjoys the same level of monopolistic dominance held by the company's Windows operating system. **********Just three years ago, Wordperfect was the world's best-selling word processor, with more than half the market. Lotus 1-2-3, the venerable spreadsheet program, had a similar market share. **********No one argues that Microsoft's pricing strategies alone are responsible for the sharp decline of these competing suites. **********Most analysts say that Microsoft gained its monopoly position in part by figuring out more quickly than others that most people want programs bundled in a suite and designed to work with and look like one another. The company also produced updates that took advantage of technological advances far more quickly than competitors did. **********As an example, Dennis Tevlin, Microsoft's director of marketing for the desktop applications division, said that when Windows 95 was released, ''Lotus and Wordperfect had ample time to develop updates. But they just didn't do it. So we were already on to our second generation when they were just shipping product.'' **********Corel assigns blame for Wordperfect's decline largely to its previous owner, Novell Inc. And a senior Lotus Development executive, who, under company policy declined to be identified, said that the many shifts in the industry the last five years, including the move to suites, brought the downfall of Lotus 1-2-3. Neither company placed primary emphasis on the pricing policy described in the states' lawsuit. **********Whatever happened in the past, said Chris Le Tocq, an analyst for Dataquest who follows this industry, ''it's very tough to see a way anyone could come in with a word processor or a spreadsheet and turn this around'' in the future. **********And Lewis E. Platt, chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company, said: ''By now, it's over in that business. Most people find it more difficult to switch applications programs than to even switch operating systems.'' **********Even Attorney General Vacco, when told of the latest sales figures, said: ''Wow! Perhaps it has gone too far, but only the marketplace can provide an answer. Given a more level playing field, can another player compete? I don't know.'' **********A senior Government official involved with the state and Federal lawsuits said, ''When a market tips as decisively as this, there's a real question whether or not it makes sense to try to generate competition.'' **********Microsoft, the state lawsuit said, offered computer manufacturers -- known in the industry as an O.E.M., for original equipment manufacturer -- two choices when buying the office suite. They can buy individual copies of the program for installation on some computers at a price of roughly $170 to $190. Or, they can buy the program at a far lower price, roughly $125, if they purchase it for installation on every computer in a company line -- the Dimension series of Dell computers, for example. **********This is called a ''per system'' license, and the suit says: ''It is impractical in an economic sense for an O.E.M. to install a competing office productivity suite on a computer subject to a per-system license. In order to do so, the O.E.M. would have to pay for both Office and the competing product, and likewise would be required to pass along to the customer the cost of offering both Office and the competing product.'' **********But Mr. Tevlin said that Microsoft's pricing was set in this manner because retailers would complain if manufacturers could buy single copies at a cost far below theirs. **********Executives of the Corel Corporation, the Canadian company that owns Wordperfect, said sales may have been hurt by this -- but not very much. ''The fact is, sales to O.E.M.s are not really a big money maker for us; the retail market is more important,'' said Cindy McGann, Corel's corporate counsel. Mr. Tevlin of Microsoft said manufacturers accounted for only about 6 percent of the Office market. **********Still, Don Sylvester, a senior vice president at Corel, argued that Microsoft's pricing ''absolutely harms everyone in the market, and nobody wants to wake up six months from now and find that Micorosoft is the only one standing in the word processing and suite market.'' **********As it is, Corel has changed its marketing strategy. ''It's clear to us that Microsoft isn't our competition anymore,'' he said. ''They are our environment, and we need to deal with that fact by making our product completely compatible with Microsoft Office so users can move files back and forth between their programs and ours.'' **********The senior Lotus executive agreed that compatibility was essential for survival. And both companies are now selling their products at a fraction of the cost of Microsoft Office. This leaves Microsoft officials wondering aloud what all the fuss is about, since predatory pricing typically means selling a product for far less than a competitor. Corel sells Wordperfect Suite to manufacturers for about $15, and the retail price for the program is only $99. Lotus is owned by I.B.M., and its suite is bundled free on most I.B.M. personal computers. The retail price of Microsoft Office is $399. **********Even with rock-bottom prices, both companies said they believed they could survive and both have large bases of customers who buy updated versions of the programs. A survey early this year of about 300 companies by the Olsten Corporation, a temporary worker company, found that 21 percent of the offices surveyed still used Wordperfect, and 27 percent still used Lotus 1-2-3."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/20/business/patents-what-s-new-pool-new-design-for-fins-protection-for-ears-float-for-baby.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1998-07-20", "snippet": "Pete McCarthy, scuba-diving entrepreneur, receives patent for new type of swimming fin that he says will require less exertion on part of divers; Joanne Marie DeAngeles gets patent for swimming goggles with built-in ear protectors; Martin C Metro ...", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; What's new at the pool: A new design for fins, protection for the ears and a float for baby.", "print_headline": "Patents; What's new at the pool: A new design for fins, protection for the ears and a float for baby.", "body_text": " **********THE last big innovation in swimming fins -- those rubber appendages that give scuba divers and snorkelers more leg power -- came in 1965, with the introduction of vents. The vents, by allowing water to pass through the fin, reduced drag and made kicking less laborious. **********Pete McCarthy, a 32-year-old scuba-diving entrepreneur, had not even been born when the vented fins first appeared. But Mr. McCarthy has just patented a new type of fin that he says will require a lot less exertion on the part of divers. **********In anthropomorphic terms, Mr. McCarthy's fin more resembles the tail of a tuna than the webbed foot of a duck. ''It's split into two slender wings that are kind of V-shaped,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''It acts like a fish tail.'' **********The fins rotate somewhat like the propeller blades on a boat, he said. ''Only they don't go all the way around.'' **********Mr. McCarthy -- who said he came up with the design through trial and error after experimenting with about 200 handmade prototypes -- quit his job as a software salesman in 1996 to work full time on his idea. **********The fins allow a diver to go faster than he would wearing conventional fins, Mr. McCarthy contends. Using an underwater speedometer that he also invented, Mr. McCarthy said he had clocked divers going about 30 percent faster with his fins. **********But that is a bit like claiming that a new car can go 150 miles an hour. Impressive, but not particularly relevant if it is used for commuting and running errands. **********A more meaningful measurement, said Jon Hardy, who runs a scuba-products testing company called Scuba Lab on Catalina Island, Calif., is the consumption of oxygen. **********Mr. Hardy, whom Mr. McCarthy paid to test his fins, said the split fins did reduce divers' air consumption. ''The fins are from 20 to 40 percent more efficient than conventional fins,'' Mr. Hardy said. Mr. McCarthy said divers wearing his fins just perform a small flutter kick, rather than the big bent-knee kick that is most effective with traditional fins. ''No knees at all,'' he said. ''You just roll your ankles.'' **********Apollo Sports, a Japanese company that distributes diving equipment in the United States, has licensed Mr. McCarthy's patent and will be coming out with its version of the split fin this summer. **********Mr. McCarthy, who has a company called Nature's Wing, in Newport Beach, Calif., said he had also licensed patent 5,746,631 to other companies that will be developing their own versions of the fin. **********Swim Goggles With Ear Protectors **********Joanne Marie DeAngelis's daughter is grown now.

Kaunda arrives at court each morning, up to 100 soldiers surround him and not only shove photographers back with rifle butts, but also jump like basketball forwards trying to block his face. **********Inside, when a political ally of his asks for a glass of water, a lawyer for Mr. Kaunda makes the court clerk taste it first. **********Suspicion runs deep in Zambian politics these days. **********In the last two years, Zambia has had a bomb blast outside the President's house, a roundup of opposition leaders, a flawed election, the shooting of two opposition candidates, a lawsuit asserting that the President is secretly a foreigner, threats of invasion, riots in the capital, a coup attempt, a roundup of 90 coup suspects, torture allegations and, on Christmas Day, the arrest of Mr. Kaunda. **********And yet, life goes rather normally.  The country, some say, would probably be much the same if none of this had happened. This nation of nine million people on the divide between relatively stable southern Africa and chaotic central Africa is stumbling along: Once relatively wealthy, now poor; once staunchly socialist, now aggressively free-market; never wholly democratic nor wholly despotic, Zambia is still giving the donor nations that support it a combination of hope and the heebie-jeebies. **********A state of emergency is in effect.  But there is no curfew, airports are open and rush-hour traffic jams the business district. As a police sergeant in the northern city of Kitwe said, ''The state of emergency is only for the political elite in Lusaka.'' **********Under the emergency's broad detention laws, Mr. Kaunda is under house arrest while the police try to build a case that he was behind the three-hour coup attempt on Oct. 28. **********His lawyers are fighting to have him released, since the prosecutors have presented no evidence, other than an unsubstantiated statement that he agreed to give the coup leaders money and jobs. But Zambia's courts are so slow that a habeas corpus hearing, normally urgent, has dragged on for a month. The Government says Mr. Kaunda exploits the hearings to make speeches, and the court has barred all press contact with him. **********Many Zambians and outside experts believe that the coup attempt had nothing to do with Mr. Kaunda, but was a foray by a few captains and majors who had been drinking and were bitter about their low pay and their generals' handsome lifestyles. **********One of the two accused coup leaders, Capt. Jackson Chiti, testified on  Jan. 15 that the police had tortured him, demanding that he implicate Mr. Kaunda. But he denied that the former President was involved and tearfully apologized to him in court. **********But there are other theories too:  one put about by some American officials and South African military experts is that Zambia overreacted to a feeble coup attempt because it is terrified that Angola is plotting against it. **********Supply flights to the Unita rebels in eastern Angola have originated in western Zambia, prompting threats of invasion by the Angolan Government. Since Angolan troops helped overthrow Presidents Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire and Pascal Lissouba in the Congo Republic last year because Unita had bases in those countries, Zambia is nervous. **********But Eric Silwamba, the President's chief of staff and a special envoy to Angola, said Zambia closed the airstrips and expelled the South African company running the supply flights, Meteor-Ex. Its relations with Angola are cordial again, he said. **********Nonetheless, a South African military expert said western Zambia's airspace is still largely unwatched by radar and the Zambian Army is spread thin in border areas west of the Zambezi River. **********Mr. Silwamba denied that the demoted Defense Minister and other party insiders had enriched themselves by helping Unita, which still controls diamond areas. **********The most common outlook on the repeated crises of the last two years is that they all spring from a deep hatred between two very touchy men: Mr. Kaunda, a schoolteacher who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964 and ruled it for 27 years, and President Frederick J. T. Chiluba, a trade unionist who formed the coalition that ousted Mr. Kaunda in a democratic election in 1991 and then fractured in squabbles. **********Mr. Chiluba ''tried to destroy Dr. Kaunda's reputation, calling him a dictator who ruined the country,'' said the Rev. Nevers Mumba, a clergyman building his own political party. ''That touched Dr. Kaunda's ego and pride. That's what made him come back into politics.'' **********The two could hardly be more different. Mr. Kaunda is tall and solid, wears Nehru suits and affects a large white handkerchief into which he alternately storms and weeps; as a liberation leader he combed his hair like Don King's, but now, at 73,  he has a gray beard and lives on raw vegetables. **********Mr. Chiluba, 54, is tiny and efficient, a fundamentalist Christian who wears natty suits and does without a scurrying entourage. In his rapid-delivery speeches, he quickly lapses into tart scorn, doing imitations while telling folksy stories deriding Mr. Kaunda, African and Western leaders and other critics. **********''I think he's driven by a fear of appearing weak,'' said Jim Polhemus, an American consultant studying democracy here. ''The people around him are telling him not to let Mandela or Mugabe or the donor nations push him around.'' **********Asked about the series of crises,  Mr. Kaunda's party says Mr. Chiluba changed the Constitution to bar him from running again in 1996, planted small bombs as an excuse to claim the existence of a ''Black Mamba gang'' and jail his party leadership until the 1996 race was over, rigged the election, secretly ordered the police to fire into Mr. Kaunda's car during a 1997 party meeting, grazing him and seriously wounding an ally, framed him on the coup charges and hopes for another chance to kill him. **********Mr. Chiluba's aides say Mr. Kaunda ignored the people's will by running again, produced false witnesses saying Mr. Chiluba is Zairian, faked his own shooting, provoked the 1997 riot in which the downtown  market was burned and arranged the coup attempt. **********Almost every one of these charges has led to court; almost all have petered out inconclusively. The Black Mamba bombing charges were dropped for lack of evidence.  The Supreme Court ruled that Mr.  Chiluba did not have to take a DNA test to prove his identity. It still has not ruled on the 1996 election. The wounding of Mr. Kaunda has yet to be officially investigated. **********Acknowledging that it looked as if the Government trumped up the  Black Mamba case, Mr. Silwamba says the police botched it by being hasty. They do not want to repeat that mistake over the coup, he said.  He denied that the Government was persecuting Mr. Kaunda. **********Many Zambians view these fights as confined to the political elite. **********''The average Zambian is marginalized completely, and the playing ground is being left to the politicians,'' said Ngande Mwanajiti, who ran the Clean Campaign Committee in 1996. As a defender of civil liberties, though, he feels threatened.  ''The police can come and take me away at any time.'' **********Most Zambians, however, are just trying to get by. The standard of living today is about half what it was in 1964, when copper prices were high. Mr. Kaunda's socialism unraveled the economy, and Mr. Chiluba's bold privatization efforts have forced thousands of layoffs. **********The foreign investment he hopes to attract is slow in arriving, and the budget is propped up with foreign aid. Mr. Silwamba calls that ''the pity of being a poor country -- they give the money, so they want you to play the tune.'' **********Mr. Chiluba's Government resents the fuss foreigners are suddenly making over Mr. Kaunda. They recall that Mr. Kaunda muzzled the press, jailed hundreds of political opponents and made children leave school to line the roads and wave whenever his motorcade went by.  Many Zambians remember waiting all night for cooking oil or sugar, which inevitably ran out, leaving soldiers to whip angry shoppers away. **********''Now,'' a museum guard said, ''it is the opposite.

Think of them as a good hedge against an overheated stock market or a global recession. **********''Any time risk is that high in equities, it's always a good idea to look at less risky alternatives, and balanced funds fall into that category,'' said Norman G. Fosback, editor of the Mutual Fund Forecaster, a newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. ''Balanced funds, as a class, are extremely attractive.'' **********The average balanced fund lost 6.7 percent in the third quarter -- a return not as good as the 1.8 percent gain for the average bond fund but far better than the 13.4 percent slide of the average stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. **********The class, however, includes a lot of individual differences. Some balanced funds are split between two managers -- one for the stock assets, one for the bonds. The funds can also have a fixed or variable asset split and enormously different objectives. **********Investors should be aware that scores of balanced funds have been rolled out recently by firms eager to fill out their product lines for the 401(k) market, said Amy Arnott, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. Nearly half of the balanced funds tracked by Morningstar have assets of less than $30 million and thus do not appear in the mutual fund tables of The New York Times. **********It may behoove investors to either select big, established balanced funds, said Ms. Arnott, or to pay extra-close attention to the style a fund uses. ''Be more cautious,'' she said. ''Especially if it's going to have a newer manager.'' **********In fact, some balanced funds are not very balanced. Portfolio managers may make big bets on the stock market, or even on certain types of stocks. Avondale Total Return, for example, has almost 86 percent of its assets in stocks and just 9 percent in bonds. The Berger Balanced fund, by contrast, has 50 percent of its assets in stocks, 18 percent in bonds and the rest in cash. In a down market, such differences between funds can produce a vast gulf in results. For the year through Sept. 30, Avondale's 1.7 percent return was far below Berger's 13.7 percent. **********The types of stocks in a balanced fund can also throw performance out of kilter. Consider the Smith Barney Security and Growth fund, which has a nearly 50-50 split between stocks and bonds. The fund may look evenly balanced, but the majority of its stock holdings are in small companies, which are getting hammered in this market -- as is the fund, down 9.4 percent through the third quarter of this year. **********While balanced funds as a group are known for their stability, certain funds still change the weightings in their portfolios radically and quickly. Provident Investment Counsel Pinnacle Balanced, for example, has cut its stock holdings to about 62 percent, from 74 percent in July, according to Jeffrey Miller, managing director of the fund. It has returned 12.7 percent this year through Sept. 30. **********Alliance Growth Investors is another balanced fund that has unloaded stocks. Nicholas D. Carn, the portfolio manager, recently cut his equity holdings to 55 percent, from 68 percent in July and 82 percent in January. ''Obviously, the high stock exposure is one of the things that has helped our performance'' in the bull market, he said. The fund returned 5 percent in the first three quarters. Investors looking for a less risky balanced fund, he said, can put their money in Alliance Conservative Investors, which has only about 23 percent of its holdings in stocks and returned 6.8 percent in the period. **********While bonds give these funds more stability, they have their own risks. In general, the longer the bonds' maturities, the higher the interest-rate risk. Long-term bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short-term bonds, but if rates rise, a fund dominated by long-term bonds is locked in at a lower rate of return. **********Balanced funds can hold many different types of bonds -- corporate and municipal, as well as Treasury -- with varying maturities. The Mainstay Total Return B fund, for example, is holding bonds with an average maturity of 13.2 years, while Avondale Total Return is holding short-term debt with an average maturity of two years. For the first three quarters, Mainstay's 7.8 percent gain beat Avondale's return by more than 6 percentage points. **********''Balanced funds are usually sold as conservative investments, but if you've got a fund that is concentrated in small stocks and long-term bonds, you don't have a conservative product,'' said Steve M. Lipper, senior vice president at Lipper Analytical Services, the research firm in Summit, N.J. **********Mutual fund experts caution investors to read the current and past semiannual reports to see what kind of securities a fund is holding and the changes the portfolio has made. **********An investor's tax bracket will also influence her choice of balanced mutual funds. One option for investors in the top brackets is USAA Growth and Tax Strategy, a fund with about 51 percent of its assets in tax-free bonds and 49 percent in growth stocks. It returned 2.8 percent in the first three quarters. **********Then, of course, there is always another option. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No Load Fund Investor, a newsletter, recommends that investors do their own portfolio balancing by buying separate stock and bond funds. That, he said, gives them more control over the amount and types of stocks they are holding and lets them plan tax gains and losses more effectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/07/business/international-briefs-fuji-bank-raising-stake-in-yasuda-trust.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-02-07", "snippet": "Fuji Bank Ltd to raise its stake in troubled Yasuda Trust & Banking Co to 16.8 percent from under 4 percent by buying 215 million shares for 50 billion yen ($404 million); both banks are part of Fuyo Group (S)", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fuji Bank Raising Stake In Yasuda Trust", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Fuji Bank Raising Stake In Yasuda Trust", "body_text": " **********Fuji Bank Ltd., Japan's sixth-biggest bank, will raise its stake in the Yasuda Trust and Banking Company to 16.8 percent from less than 4 percent now by purchasing 215 million shares in the troubled lender.

''If they are not virgins they can be charged with practicing prostitution or brought back to their families, where they often face serious problems.'' **********''No one should have an interest in whether an adult woman is a virgin or not,'' Dr. Yuksel said.

He began working in the automobile industry in Britain in 1925 as a designer but also had an interest in bicycles. **********Only a few hundred examples of his streamlined, fiberglass-construction Bowden Spacelander bike were built. It was one of a handful of creations selected from hundreds of entries in 1946 by the British Council of Industrial Design for a London exhibition, Britain Can Make It. **********The original model included an electric motor that gathered energy on downhill and flat terrain and helped the rider climb hills.

The yen's higher exchange value makes their products more expensive abroad and lowers the value of their foreign earnings when converted back into yen. **********''If the high yen trend continues, we will see the influence on our sales and profits within several months,'' Tamotsu Iba, vice president of Sony, said in a statement. ''The current rapid rise in the yen does not reflect the fundamentals of the Japanese economy.'' **********Up until this week, the yen had been weakening for months, a reflection of the litany of economic problems confronting Japan: debt-laden banks, rising bankruptcies, falling domestic sales, plummeting business confidence and a stock market that has continued to flirt with 12-year lows. Asia's economic crisis put further downward pressure on the yen. **********But the yen's weakness has also been regarded as a benefit to Japan because it has helped stimulate exports, the one area of Japan's economy that has continued to maintain relative health. **********Now, the abrupt change to a stronger yen, combined with signs of economic weakness appearing in Japan's most important market, the United States, has raised doubts about Japanese exporters as well. **********Share prices of companies heavily dependent on exports have been falling recently. Many of those companies are the bluest of Japan's blue chips, the industrial elite of the nation. **********Honda shares, for example, fell 470 yen yesterday, to close at 2,900 yen, while Sony's shares declined 380, to 7,770 yen. Honda is now trading at about 9 times earnings, while Sony trades at 16 times earnings. In comparison, shares of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which is less dependent on exports to the United States than Honda and Sony, trade at 27 times earnings. **********''It's hard to say in any definitive way what the exact impact could be without knowing each company's hedging ratios, the final demand for their products and where they are produced,'' said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. ''But I still think that, net-net, it's hard to say it's positive for the exporters.'' **********Some companies did offer rudimentary snapshots of the potential impact of the yen's swing. **********A one yen move in the dollar-yen exchange rate makes a 5-billion-yen difference in Sony's profits. Thus, the recent seesaw of the rate from 135.35 yen to the dollar when trading opened this week to 116.95 yen in late New York trading today caused a slide of more than $780 million in potential earnings from Sony's operating profits. The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car company, sees a 10-billion-yen swing in operating profits every time the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuates by one yen. **********The yen's rise is not necessarily viewed as a bad development elsewhere in Asia -- in fact, other weakened Asian economies could benefit from a rising yen because it would make their exports more competitive. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand rose today because of that prospect. **********But Japan has been counting on its mighty car and electronics manufacturers with their vast global sales networks to generate the cash needed to keep its gross domestic product from slumping further than the 1.8 percent decline the Government has projected. With much of Asia still stuck in an economic rut and the domestic market in a funk, the Japanese exporters are regarded as increasingly important to Japan's still- elusive recovery. **********If the United States economy slows further, as many believe it will, and the yen maintains its current strength, corporate Japan will face an unprecedented jump in excess capacity and inventories, which are already at levels that are pressuring prices. While the long-term impact of the drop in the dollar could become moot overnight should sentiment turn again, sudden swings in the exchange rate can hurt day-to-day corporate decision-making. **********''The movement affects short-term business conditions, too, in terms of competitiveness,'' said Aston J. Bridgman, a spokesman for NEC, the world's second-largest semiconductor manufacturer. ''If we're bidding on projects, we can quickly become uncompetitive when exchange rates swing like they have today and yesterday.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/27/business/working-the-prodigal-team-player.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Cottle", "pub_date": "1998-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Prodigal Team Player", "print_headline": "WORKING; The Prodigal Team Player", "body_text": " **********Q. I am part of a small team that creates product marketing materials for our manufacturing company.

Without a doubt, your best option is C: Neither of the above. (Isn't that always the case?) Both courses you mention aren't really plans at all; rather, they are ways to avoid dealing with your team's problem. And you do have a problem. **********It is essential for everyone in a group to recognize that each member is responsible for the performance of the whole, says Jon R. Katzenbach, a director with McKinsey & Company, the consultants, and an author of ''The Wisdom of Teams'' (HarperBusiness). ''All members should be mutually accountable to one another for their expenditures or the budget or whatever,'' he said. ''Otherwise, you don't have a real team.'' **********For a work group to function effectively -- and profitably -- the members must address internal crises like a spendthrift's  breaking of the budget. They shouldn't wait for an outsider to instill order. ''The team should confront the person,'' Mr. Katzenbach advised. ''Say: 'Look, we're all accountable for this. We have to collectively be comfortable that this spending is going to help us achieve our purpose.' '' **********David Schafer, a vice president at the Enron Corporation who has worked closely with self-directed teams, said, ''One characteristic of teams that really should have appeal is the self-policing nature of the group.'' **********Of course, it can take time for a team to learn how to handle conflicts itself, rather than relying on a supervisor. ''It's certainly not automatic,'' Mr. Schafer said. ''One of the things I would tell my teams is that there's safety in numbers. You've got to be careful not to look like you're ganging up on someone, but whoever confronts the person can say: 'This isn't just my take on the issue. This is the way the group sees it.' '' **********Ron Burnaska, a consultant at the General Electric Company on personnel and team issues, offered a four-step approach: *********** Designate a team member to confront the offender about the group's concerns. *********** Ask the offender the reasons for his behavior. (There may be a good explanation.) *********** If the explanation isn't convincing,  work with the person on a corrective plan. *********** Arrange a follow-up meeting with the person to review the situation and determine if progress is being made. **********No one likes confrontations with co-workers. But if the problem festers, Mr. Schafer warned, ''frustration levels on the team rise and suck the energy out of the group.'' **********Besides, your team's only alternative is to wait for a higher-up to step in and handle your management responsibilities for you.

Jesse L. Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH coalition. **********The meeting -- with its star-studded cast that included President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- offered Mr. Jackson and his organization an opportunity to generate headlines again while raising tough questions about why black Americans and other minorities have had so little access to investment capital, financial training and well-paying jobs. **********And with affirmative action under increasing assault in the political arena and in the courts, business may actually be a friendlier forum these days for Mr. Jackson to practice his patented blend of uplift and agitation. Hobnobbing with the country's financial titans did not hurt Mr. Jackson's image, either. **********''You raised my stock, thank you very much,'' Mr. Jackson half-jokingly told Mr.  Greenspan after the Fed chairman addressed the conference. He did more than that. The meeting also provided Mr. Jackson and Rainbow/PUSH with an opportunity to raise tens of thousands of dollars from Wall Street's bulging pockets. **********Mr. Jackson would not say exactly how much money had been raised by this week's event, although he said that the event's sponsors, which included big Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary of Travelers Group, had provided $400,000 ''in round figures'' to help cover the cost. **********Rainbow/PUSH also held a fund-raiser Thursday night on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, with about 450 guests paying $500 each for dinner and entertainment by the singer Roberta Flack. Mr. Jackson declined to say how much that event had raised, explaining that not all the costs had been calculated. He also raised money yesterday at a $350-a-head luncheon. **********But beyond the coffers filled, is anything likely to change as a result of the sessions, which combined 1960's-style consciousness-raising with a hardheaded 1990's focus on the bottom line? **********For the middle-aged white men who run most Wall Street firms, the two-day gathering at the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan that ended late yesterday offered an opportunity to pay lip service to minority hiring and to wear their hearts on their sleeves before a basically sympathetic audience. **********After all, critics said, Wall Street has plenty of explaining to do: Blacks now account for no more than 600 of the country's 90,000 brokers, according to Tony Chapelle, publisher of Securities Pro newsletter, which reports on blacks on Wall Street. The percentage of employees in the securities industry who are black has dropped from 10.6 percent in 1990 to 8.4 percent in 1996. And nearly three out of five blacks on Wall Street are employed as office and clerical workers, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. **********The conference exposed a clear divide on Wall Street. In general, firms with lots of ordinary customers seemed to take the conference more seriously. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover both contributed to the event, officials said, and senior executives from each firm attended. **********But firms that deal little with the investing public, like Lehman Brothers, seemed less involved. William Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman, said this week that the firm had ''at least one person attending,'' but was not supporting the event with a donation  or providing speakers for any of the industry panels. **********Asked what he had achieved at the conference, Mr. Jackson gave a discursive answer, setting out the grim economic history of the country's black population. ''For 250 years blacks were listed as commodities,'' he said. **********''There are these definable, quantifiable gaps in our economy,'' he said, adding that the conference had helped to draw attention to ''the investment gap, the education gap and the trade gap in our economy.'' **********''Wall Street stands to gain if it closes the gap,'' he said. **********In interviews, Mr. Jackson and his staff insisted yesterday that they would continue to keep a close eye on Wall Street, and that their newfound closeness with the securities industry would be characterized by ''tough love,'' combining friendship and criticism. **********At some firms, Mr. Jackson's carrot approach appears to be having some effect. James Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Smith Barney, has told managers for the last two years that they will be rewarded financially if they succeed in hiring good minority and women candidates, according to Gordon McAndrew, a spokesman for the firm. **********But the stick may prove even more effective. Smith Barney settled a class action suit brought by women and minority employees in part by pledging to do more to safeguard their rights. A resolution to a similar suit brought against Merrill Lynch is currently being negotiated. **********Mr. Jackson, when asked about the cases, replied with a broad statement offering few specific suggestions. **********As for the black business leaders among the 650 people in attendance, the meeting was a chance to do more than exchange business cards. ''It's bringing people together to focus on the task at hand,'' said Kenneth I. Tatum of Mitchell & Titus L.L.P., an accounting and consulting firm. That task, he said, is to ''insure that minorities get to share opportunities'' in fast-growth sectors of the economy like finance, software and high technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/30/world/reporter-s-notebook-africa-presents-clinton-with-a-raft-of-distractions.html": {"writer_name": "James Bennet", "pub_date": "1998-03-30", "snippet": "Reporter's Notebook offers vignettes of Pres Clinton's visit to Botswana; photo; map (M)", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Africa Presents Clinton With a Raft of Distractions", "print_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Africa Presents Clinton With a Raft of Distractions", "body_text": " **********President Clinton seemed to have every reason to fear that his embarrassing troubles back home -- ''the current situation,'' as some White House officials delicately refer to it -- would trail him to Africa, during the 12-day trip that brought him here today for two days of relaxing among the big game of the Kalahari Desert. **********Last Monday morning, as the President prepared to disembark from Air Force One in Accra, Ghana, for his first moments on African soil, Kwesi Koomson, a Ghanaian reporter for the Business Chronicle in Accra, stood musing over who would emerge next. **********''Let's see if it's Monica or Kathleen,'' he said softly, with only the slightest of grins. Turning to an American colleague, Mr. Koomson proceeded to display an intricate knowledge not only about Monica S. Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey, but also about other members of the ensemble in the running White House follies. **********''Ken Starr,'' Mr. Koomson said, referring to the independent counsel. ''Do you think he is getting frustrated with his job?'' **********And so it went, from country to country: shouted questions about legal maneuverings from White House reporters and lewd editorial cartoons in the local newspapers. President Clinton was in town, a popular radio host warned in Cape Town on Thursday, and added, ''Lock up your daughters!'' **********The presence in Mr. Clinton's delegation of Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel, and Betty Currie, the President's personal secretary, served as reminders to those on the road of the troubles back home. Both have testified to the grand jury. **********Mrs. Currie's testimony is believed to have differed in a critical way from a sworn deposition by Mr. Clinton, though she has seemed happy and relaxed when glimpsed on this trip. ''Wonderful!'' she exclaimed on Thursday, when asked what she thought of Mr. Clinton's speech to the South African Parliament. **********As the week wore on, and as somber matters like the 1994 genocide in Rwanda took center stage, ''the current situation'' receded farther into the background. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Clinton was not asked about Ms. Lewinsky. Granted, Nelson Mandela was standing beside him, and Mr. Clinton took only four questions. But even an extra question shouted by an American reporter at the President's retreating back was about gun control, not executive privilege. **********By Friday evening in Cape Town, Mr. Clinton evidently felt relaxed enough to wander within easy questioning range of reporters. ''I like your hat,'' he told one of them. Surprised, she replied, ''Oh, really?'' **********''I noticed it earlier today,'' Mr. Clinton said. No, despite initial reports to the contrary, the hat was not a beret. It was brown, and had a brim. **********At Church, Two Sermons **********This morning, before he left South Africa, Mr. Clinton -- or at least some reporters traveling with him -- received a jolting reminder at a church service in Soweto of the charges back in Washington. **********In the Regina Mundi Catholic Church, a refuge for black activists during the apartheid fight, the pastor performed a Lenten reading that happens to be about an adulterous woman. ''If there is one of you who has not sinned, let him be the first to throw a stone at her,'' he read. **********In his remarks later to the enthusiastic congregation of 1,000, Mr. Clinton did not allude to the reading. Speaking about the hard work ahead for South Africa, he offered a snippet of Scripture that he called ''one of the very most important to me.'' **********''When you are discouraged, when you are frustrated, when you are angry, when you wonder whether you can make the most of your freedom for these children,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''remember what St. Paul said to the Galatians: 'Let us not grow weary in doing good. For in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.' '' **********The Local Delicacy, Worm **********Africa has presented the White House, which has been known to go to great lengths to divert reporters from the President's woes, with plenty of potential diversions. Today, the President's press secretary ate a worm. **********Presented with a local delicacy -- a Mopane worm boiled in salt water and dried in the sun -- Michael D. McCurry popped it into his mouth. Then, at the request of journalists, he ate another one for the cameras. ''Tastes like a dead worm,'' he reported, ''fried in oil.'' **********What Happened at the Gate **********Not that the White House has been happy with all of the coverage of this trip. Administration officials have been aggravated with reporters for focusing on the President's contrite comments about past American actions here. **********Some were furious about television reports that showed Mr. Clinton in Ghana shouting for a crowd to move back after he had approached to shake hands. The pictures, they said, played into the worst stereotypes about Africans and implied that Mr. Clinton was fearful when he was actually trying to protect two women pressed against the steel barricades. **********''The subtheme of that was savagery, out-of-control violence,'' said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the President's special envoy to Africa. He said the crowd was actually engaged in a ''love surge.'' **********Ready to Rest **********A further reason that the charges regarding Ms. Lewinsky have slipped into the background may be sheer exhaustion, because of the sleepless schedule set by the White House.

The third time through, titters swept the crowd of 2,000 or so. **********When he stepped up to the lectern, Mr. Clinton greeted the people on the podium and ''all the other people who have previously been recognized by a previous speaker.'' The crowd cracked up. **********The President went on to speak for less than six minutes, without ever removing his sunglasses.

Domingo Laino, 62, leader of the Alliance parties, won 43.1 percent. Mr. Laino, a career politician and human rights activist, has made two previous unsuccessful bids for the presidency. The results were released by Saka, a respected civic organization. Official tallies will not be available for several days. **********Though public opinion surveys had shown the Colorado and the Alliance parties in a dead tie, the Colorado also appeared to have won majorities in Congress, taking 24 seats in the Senate to the opposition's 21, and 43 of 80 seats in the lower house. **********The Colorado, which has become a potent fusion of political party, patronage machine, cultural tradition and state during its many years in power, had been riven by internal schisms that led to repeated calls for the postponement of elections. The Colorado was also the party of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, whose 35-year dictatorship was the last to end in South America, in 1989. **********Though the Colorado party was euphoric with its election victory,  which supporters began celebrating even before exit polls were announced, party leaders turned their attention today to settling internal differences to produce a government program. **********Uppermost in the public debate was the fate of Lino Oviedo, an Army general who precipitated the political crisis here when he defied a presidential order to retire two years ago in what was generally seen as an attempt to seize power from President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. **********Though Mr. Cubas won the vote, the triumph was General Oviedo's. Mr. Cubas had started as the general's vice presidential running mate in party primaries last September. After he unexpectedly won the primary, General Oviedo was arrested  and sentenced to 10 years for insubordination for his actions two years previously. At rallies and victory celebrations yesterday, supporters called out the general's name, not that of the newly elected President. **********Today, Mr. Cubas, who had campaigned on the slogan, ''Cubas in government, Oviedo in power,'' left his options open when asked about General Oviedo's future. ''We're going to try to see that justice is done with him, and afterwards we'll see what he would like or can do,'' Mr. Cubas said. **********Experts here said Mr. Cubas's most urgent task will be getting Paraguay's financial house in order. Its economy has been stagnant for 15 years, and has shrunk for the last 2 years. The country is a center for arms and drug smuggling and most of the economy is underground. **********It also remains a bastion of old-style Government spending, with the state owning the telecommunications, energy, ports and other key industries.

The report is expected to be released next week. **********While hard and fast numbers are impossible to come by, Cerulli estimates that total assets under the hedge funds' management, referred to as investors' capital, have increased roughly sixfold since 1990 to some $300 billion at the end of 1997. The figures do not reflect borrowing by the funds, which significantly increases the amount they can invest and the impact that they have on markets. About half of the money invested is from foreign investors, using off-shore funds. The number of funds has more than doubled to roughly 4,500. **********Despite the recent debacle involving Long-Term Capital Management, Cerulli believes investors will continue to clamor to put their money in hedge funds and estimates that assets will continue to climb by at least 15 percent annually over the next 5 to 10 years. ''I still believe the industry is very alive and positioned for growth,'' said Jeff Benjamin, a consultant with Cerulli who was the lead author of the report. **********Once the domain of wealthy investors, hedge funds are now attracting pension funds, endowments, foundations and investment managers who invest in a group of hedge funds. These institutions, which accounted for only 5 percent of the hedge funds' assets five years ago, now account for about 80 percent of assets. The involvement of such big institutions should help push hedge funds, which frequently refuse to let their investors know exactly what they are doing, to disclose more about their strategies and what they own. **********On the basis of a data base of about 1,100 funds, Cerulli also offers a glimpse into the makeup of these funds. While George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr. get the lion's share of attention, most of the funds are much smaller entities. About a quarter of them have assets of less than $10 million, and only about 5 percent have assets of more than $500 million. **********''They operate like little entrepreneurs, in one-to-two-person offices,'' Mr. Benjamin said. **********While Cerulli did not examine the strategies of these funds in any detail, the report does show that about 81 percent of the funds use borrowings to leverage their returns. Mr. Benjamin estimates that the majority of funds do not use the extraordinarily high leverage that Long-Term Capital employed, but typically keep their borrowings to less than five times their assets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/03/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-03", "snippet": "Natural gas prices fall 7.5 percent after Hurricane Earl veers away from rigs off Texas and Louisiana, easing supply worries; graphs (S)", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********NATURAL GAS TUMBLES.

In ''The Lie of the Land: Migrant Workers and the Californian Landscape'' (University of Minnesota Press, 1996), he explored how the endless struggles between big farming interests and migrant workers shaped the state's agricultural landscape. **********''The way the land looks today is the result of these debates and arguments,'' he said in the phone interview. **********As an example, he pointed to the labor camps built for migrant workers in California's central valley after the strikes of 1933 and 1934 because authorities feared a social explosion if the farmers failed to improve conditions for their help. ''You only find decent living and washing facilities where the workers were militant,'' he said. **********As other examples of the way social or political conflicts can shape a landscape, Mr. Mitchell cites Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's East Village and the People's Park near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. **********Both parks, he said, are products of long political battles among various interests, including city and university bureaucrats, local residents, environmentalists and advocates of the rights of homeless people. **********In New York, a result has been a space that now serves the needs of local residents, while in Berkeley the university constructed a park where it had originally planned to build dormitories. **********Mr. Mitchell, born in Walnut Creek, Calif., came to Syracuse University in 1997 from the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had taught since gaining a doctorate in geography from Rutgers University in 1992. **********He said he had no firm idea yet how he would spend his award: ''I'm not an entrepreneur.

That is a record pace, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Among the latest to close are Lord Abbett Research Small-Cap, with $677 million in assets; Janus Overseas, $4.2 billion, and Vanguard Primecap, $10.2 billion. **********If the market stays strong, more funds are likely to follow suit, particularly among the ranks of top-performing small-  and mid-cap stock funds that often have trouble putting sudden, large amounts of new cash to work. But would-be investors should take heart: There are often ways to slither into such closed funds, even as companies tighten the loopholes. **********In past years, many closings were announced well in advance -- a sort of last call for outside investors to plunk down their money before the fund rolled up the welcome mat. But fund companies have become less hospitable since the infamous 1991 closing of the Janus Venture fund, which offered new investors a three-month grace period to get in. It was swamped with new money and suffered from the bloat for years. **********By contrast, Vanguard announced the immediate closing of its Primecap fund after the close of business on April 21. What's more, it now limits existing shareholders to a maximum additional investment of $25,000 a year. **********Fund managers often turn off the investment spigot for the best of reasons -- to protect returns for existing investors -- but the announcements often cause new shareholders to rush in before the deadline. **********''Everyone wants what they can't have,'' said Stephen Janachowski, partner in Brouwer & Janachowski, an investment firm in Tiburon, Calif., that specializes in placing client money in no-load mutual funds. ''When a fund closes, there's definitely an allure. For better or for worse, people want to get in.'' **********How does the determined investor storm the ramparts of such a fund? There are several ways. **********Friends and family may provide the easiest point of entry to a closed fund. For example, family members of any Janus fund shareholder are welcomed into any of the firm's funds, including the just-closed Janus Overseas, provided they have the same home address as the shareholder. Similar accommodations may be offered by other fund companies; investors can check the fund prospectus for details. **********Fund companies do not advertise the fact, but it is simple for an investor to transfer shares of his or her stock to family members, or even to strangers. One- or two-page transfer-of-ownership forms, available from fund companies, are used most often to transfer shares within a family --  from a parent to a child, for example, or, for married couples, to change from single to joint ownership. **********Many fund companies once allowed transfers as small as a single share, but no longer. At Vanguard, for example, there is a $3,000 minimum. And if you are the seller who is helping someone in from the cold, remember that the current price for a share of your fund, expressed as net asset value, is only part of the real cost, because of likely capital gains upon which you'll be taxed. **********FOR buyers, the main problem can be finding a shareholder who is willing to sell. That's where the Internet can help. ''On line gets you out there fastest,'' says Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors. **********Prospective buyers, for example, can post a bulletin-board message at  Web sites like www.morningstar.net or on Sage Online, available only to subscribers of America Online, offering to pay above net asset value for a particular fund. Sellers can then use transfer-of-ownership forms to make the deal. **********The discount broker Jack White & Company runs a service called Connect that matches mutual fund buyers and sellers. The service was started in 1990 as a way to match buyers and sellers of load funds, allowing buyers to sidestep the sales charge. While Connect is not widely known, it can also help you gain entry to a fund that is technically closed to new money. Buyers pay a flat $200 fee, which is split between the seller and the brokerage firm. **********Here is how the service works: The investor opens a brokerage account at Jack White ($500 minimum in cash or securities), and informs  the broker that he is interested in buying into a specific mutual fund. Then he waits until a seller appears -- and the vigil may be long. **********''There are some funds we've never found a match for,'' warned Peter Mangan, executive vice president at Jack White. ''Others have a long list of interested buyers. We match orders by size, and serve them on a first-come, first-served basis.'' Among the funds in highest demand are T. Rowe Price New Horizons and FPA Capital. **********Another tactic is to hire a financial adviser. When most big funds close the door on new retail investors, they also do so on registered financial advisers, who manage accounts for their individual customers. But with some fund companies, especially smaller ones, there is often some leeway for an investor to wiggle in.  Skyline Asset Management of Chicago, for example, closed its Skyline Special Equities Portfolio to new investors last year. But advisers with a minimum $250,000 investment in the fund as of Jan 30, 1997, are grandfathered in, and may continue to place new clients in the fund, a small-cap value offering with $561 million in assets. **********''It's a courtesy to advisers who believed in us early and put significant assets with us,'' says Michele  Brennan, director of marketing. ''They put a lot of time and effort into choosing funds. When one closes, it can cause a lot of problems for them.'' **********Of course, to pursue this option, investors must be willing to turn over their money to a professional manager. If one is in the market for professional advice anyway, this route makes sense. **********IS it wise to spend the time and effort to seek out such funds? The short answer: It depends. The Sequoia Fund closed to new investors in December 1982. It has returned 19.9 percent annually since then, compared with 15.5 percent for the average large-value peer fund, according to Morningstar. That certainly seems worth the trouble. **********But the desire to gain access to such forbidden fruit is not always well-founded. ''A fund closes because a manager feels the fund's performance is threatened,'' said Susan Belden, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, an investment guide published in Orinda, Calif. ''There are so many funds out there to choose from,'' she said, that it is hardly worth the time to pursue one that has closed. **********On the other hand, the No-Load Fund Analyst includes three closed funds -- Strong Common Stock, N/I Growth, and Harbor International -- in its ''model portfolio'' of 20 recommended offerings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/07/business/company-news-seagram-to-sell-its-state-in-french-fashion-house.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-08-07", "snippet": "Seagram Co will sell it majority stake in Herve Leger, a French fashion house, to BCBG Max Azria, maker of men's and women's clothing, for undisclosed price (S)", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEAGRAM TO SELL ITS STATE IN FRENCH FASHION HOUSE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SEAGRAM TO SELL ITS STATE IN FRENCH FASHION HOUSE", "body_text": " **********The Seagram Company agreed yesterday to sell its majority stake in Herve Leger, a French fashion house, to the closely held BCBG Max Azria, a maker of men's and women's clothing, for an undisclosed price.

One title is ''An Instance of the Fingerpost,'' a British literary thriller by Iain Pears, just published in the United States under the Riverhead imprint. The other is ''Firebird,'' a romantic first novel by Janice Graham to be published under the Putnam imprint in July. **********In both cases, rather than planning  the authors' bookstore and media appearances around publication date, as is customary, Putnam sent Mr. Pears to 13 cities, and Ms.Graham to 20 cities, five months in advance, when signings and interviews were nowhere on the horizon. But it was at the times when retailers were deciding how many copies of each book they would initially stock. **********In each city, the author met 8 or 10 independent and chain booksellers, journalists and book club leaders over a group meal. Then came the follow-up: from October, when Mr. Pears's tour took place, until publication in March, a different coordinated mailing piece arrived on booksellers' desks every month. A similar campaign will ensue for Ms. Graham, who conducted her meet-and-eat tour in February and early March. **********''It's a clear sign of the lengths to which a publisher now goes to make a case for an unknown author,'' said Jeff Seroy, vice president for publicity at a competitor, the Farrar, Straus unit of Holtzbrinck. **********Other publishers could recall only one other occasion when something similar was tried, albeit on a much smaller scale. In January 1996, Henry Holt, another Holtzbrinck unit, took the English novelist John Lanchester on a six-city ''eating tour'' for ''The Debt to Pleasure'' three months before publication. According to Holt executives, the ploy worked beautifully, capturing attention for this first novel, which went on to sell more than 50,000 copies. **********Now Putnam is gambling that this expensive ''quality time'' and intensive, carefully designed follow-up will influence retailers' orders and ''better position our authors,'' says Marilyn Ducksworth, the senior vice president who devised the plan. **********Although another competitor, Random House, has not tried Ms. Ducksworth's particular gambit, Carol Schneider, a Random House associate publisher said she understood the impulse. ''Everyone is aware of the need to get a buzz started as early as possible,'' Ms. Schneider said, ''partly because the bookstore chains make their buying decisions so early and partly because the marketplace seems so much more competitive.'' **********These days, even presidents of some publishing houses are taking to the road to introduce important titles to accounts, as Morgan Entrekin did last year to introduce booksellers to Charles Frazier's first novel, ''Cold Mountain,'' which became a best seller and literary award winner. **********Publishers reserve such efforts for books with best-seller potential that have usually cost them a large royalty advance. Ms. Graham's book was bought as the first in a three-book, world-rights deal for $1 million, a sum Putnam has already recouped through foreign rights sales. Industry executives say that Putnam paid a substantial six-figure sum for Mr. Pears's book. **********Although Mr. Pears is the author of several mysteries, and ''An Instance of the Fingerpost'' was a best seller after its publication in Britain last September, his is not a household name and British success does not necessarily translate into American sales. Moreover, the shy, scholarly Mr. Pears ''wouldn't fare well on the show circuit,'' his editor, Julie Grau, conceded. The book itself requires a fair degree of intellectual gymnastics, costs $27, and, at 700 pages risks ''landing with a thud'' on reviewers' desks, Ms. Grau said. **********Lise Friedman, the events coordinator at Dutton's bookstore in Los Angeles, recalled eating breakfast with Mr. Pears. ''We ordered 35 copies because we could see how important the book was to the publisher,'' she said. ''We probably would have ordered five without the tour and follow-up.'' **********Another who met with Mr. Pears was Steve Wasserman, editor of The Los Angeles Times Book Review, which featured the book on its front page the week of publication. **********Compared with the introverted Mr. Pears, Ms. Graham is outgoing and vivacious. But she posed a separate set of marketing challenges. ''At publication it would be very difficult to get consumers into the stores for signings with someone they'd never heard of,'' Ms. Ducksworth said. Indeed, an author talking to rows of empty chairs is an embarrassing commonplace event on the signing circuit these days. **********Thus far, the advance introductions seem to be paying off handsomely. Mr. Pears's book made its debut at No. 11 on yesterday's New York Times best-seller list. Costco, the warehouse club chain, has decided to make Ms. Graham's novel the debut selection for its new book club. **********Familiarity may breed contentment. Leslie Graham, head buyer at a San Francisco bookstore called a Clean, Well Lighted Place, met with Ms. Graham (no relation) and recalled, ''Many of us don't normally read romantic fiction; but because we were breakfasting with her, every bookseller had read the entire novel.'' **********That impressed Ms. Graham. ''I was told touring would be incredibly stressful, but I found this tour to be a writer's dream,'' she said. ''What better than actually to come in contact with people who've read your book?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/22/business/international-briefs-german-bank-forming-venture-with-insurer.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-09-22", "snippet": "Dresdner Bank AG, Germany's third-largest bank, and Allianz AG, Europe's second-largest insurer, to form asset management venture in effort to cut costs (S)", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Bank Forming Venture With Insurer", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; German Bank Forming Venture With Insurer", "body_text": " **********Dresdner Bank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank, and Allianz A.G., Europe's second-largest insurer, said yesterday that they would form an asset management venture in an effort to cut costs.

In the evenings, he rushes to open the doors of tourists cars. He works outside Pain de Paris, an expensive bakery in Vedado. Most nights, he makes at least $2. When someone handed him $1 recently, the boy rushed home to buy bananas for dinner. **********Years ago, it was easier for parents to keep their children blissfully unaware of both their true political feelings and the hardships they went through. But now, with the country's economy in chaos, even young children know that once they turn 7 they lose the right to buy milk. **********They know that the Government issues only two school uniforms during elementary school -- one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade. And that they are no longer able to buy toys because the Government did away with the yearly ritual of selling toys to children on the 26th of July, the anniversary of the beginning of Fidel Castro's armed uprising in 1953. **********The contradictions of their young lives -- hearing one message in school and another, radically different, at home -- confuses some children. Their teachers want them to fight the Americans; their parents want to join them or, at least, to get some of their dollars. **********''Mom,'' a 7-year-old girl recently asked her mother, ''if William Clinton is so bad, why do we want to go live with him?'' **********Trusting their children and thinking them ready to absorb contrasting messages, many parents openly discuss their beliefs in front of them and even mock the revolutionary slogans and songs they bring home. But then they ask their children to keep it to themselves. **********Some parents fear that their children will be ostracized if their teachers know that they live in a non-revolutionary home. Parents who make a living in what the Government considers illegal activities -- renting a room or selling cigars without a license -- also fear that, if their children talk, the Government may confiscate their goods, fine them or, in some cases, jail them. **********The burden of living in two distinct realities affects some children in psychological and physical ways. Teresita, a 14-year-old ninth grader who lives in Old Havana, said she had never told her best friend that her parents desperately want to leave the country. **********She has also never told anyone that, when the doors are locked, her mother rants against President Castro, blaming his Government for the scarcities in their home. Two months ago, Teresita began to shed the hairs of her arms and legs. The doctors told her that she lacked some essential vitamins in her diet; the mother thinks it is a result of stress. **********A 52-year-old writer who insisted on being identified only by his first name, Angel, cannot stand a song praising the revolution that his 9-year-old daughter has been singing lately. He tells her to stop and his daughter obeys. The mother, worried about her daughter, intercedes. **********''You want your children to be a full member of the family, to know how you feel about everything,'' said the mother, a member of the Communist Party who long ago grew disenchanted with the revolution but outside the home pretends to be as enthusiastic as ever. ''But I worry sometimes how all this is going to affect her and how much contradiction she can really absorb in her young mind.'' **********Yet the girl's mother, in a fit of anger, recently ripped to pieces her red Communist Party ID and threw it out the window. It was her daughter who ran three flights downstairs in a panic to retrieve the picture from the sidewalk so that no one would ever know what her mother had done. **********While Angel helps his daughter with her homework, he systematically deconstructs everything she has been taught at school. She is now learning about Jose Marti, a 19th-century patriot who fought to free Cuba from Spanish colonialism. In Cuba today, Marti is also regarded as the intellectual precursor of the revolution. Angel tells his daughter that Marti would never have supported Mr. Castro's Government. The little girl giggles and rolls her eyes. **********But there is very little that parents  can do to shape their children's education. In a country with no private schools and compulsory education until ninth grade, parents are forced to send their children to state-run schools. They also have no say about the curriculum and, more and more these days, very little about their children's extracurricular activities. **********Some parents try to exert control by taking their children late to school  to avoid the morning ritual where students salute the flag, sing the national anthem and repeat revolutionary slogans. Others are turning to religion, hoping that lessons in catechism will open their children's minds to other points of view. **********The Roman Catholic Church is taking full advantage of it. To make the shift easier for the children, it is incorporating some of the messages children hear in school into Sunday sermons. It is not unusual for priests now to somehow link Cuba's patriots to religion. **********At a recent Mass here, Jaime Cardinal Ortega Alamino drew cheers from his mostly young listeners when he reminded them that the full name of Antonio Maceo, one of Cuba's most revered martyrs, was Antonio de la Caridad, a clear reference to Cuba's patriot saint, Our Lady of Charity. **********Priests in some churches are also enticing children to attend Mass and catechism classes through a system of bonuses and rewards. Children receive bonuses for every Mass and catechism class they attend. Once a week, they can exchange the bonuses for gifts like gum, clothing, pencils and toys, all donated from churches abroad. **********''They get things they want and need and we get an opportunity to show them the church's way,'' said the Rev. Jesus Maria Lusarreta, a priest at La Milagrosa, where more than 400 children attend catechism weekly. **********During his five-day visit to Cuba in January, Pope John Paul II referred to Cuba's youth in two of the four Masses he held. At the first, in Santa Clara, some parents nodded in silence when the Pope said, ''Parents must be acknowledged as the first and foremost educators of their children.'' **********But it is difficult for parents to heed the Pope's words. Elementary school children go to school here from 8 A.M. to 4:20 P.M. On Saturdays, they often return to school for sports or political events. Sometimes they sleep over in the school to await so-called Domingos de Defensa, Sundays of Defense, days in which the children practice what it is like to be under attack and receive their lessons in a bunker. **********Marta Perez Herrera, deputy director of Pepito Tey, an elementary school in Old Havana, said that, beginning in third grade, children are  trained by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who teach them everything from patriotic symbols to military moves. At a recent practice session in a park, uniformed men were training young children to march as one. **********While the children marched, a 16-year-old girl in tight pink shorts stood in a corner a few blocks away eyeing foreigners. The girl, Yanel Noa, said she dropped out of school because she did not want to work in the fields, a requirement for all students in high school. **********Had she continued in school, she would have become a dancer, she said. For now, she lives off the charity of a special friend: a 32-year-old married American man who often travels to Cuba loaded with cash."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/14/business/company-briefs-578720.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********ABBOTT LABORATORIES, Abbott Park, Ill., a health care company, said its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, and increased the company's quarterly dividend 11 percent, to 30 cents a share. **********CAPITAL AUTOMOTIVE, Arlington, Va., a real estate investment trust specializing in acquiring auto dealership properties, said it sold 20 million shares for $300 million, or $15 each, in an initial public offering. **********BAYOU STEEL CORP., La Place, La., agreed to acquire Northwestern Steel and Wire Co. in Sterling, Ill., for about $96 million in cash and stock. **********CITICORP, New York, said it was moving much of its student loan business to South Dakota, eliminating 580 mostly clerical jobs in Perinton, N.Y."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/24/business/international-business-thyssen-and-dover-in-1.1-billion-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-11-24", "snippet": "Thyssen AG agrees to buy elevator business of Dover Corp for $1.1 billion (S)", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thyssen and Dover in $1.1 Billion Deal", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Thyssen and Dover in $1.1 Billion Deal", "body_text": " **********Thyssen A.G., the fifth-largest elevator and escalator maker in the world, said today that it had agreed to buy the elevator business of the Dover Corporation for $1.1 billion as it seeks to expand in North America. **********Thyssen Industrie, a unit of Thyssen, will pay Dover, which is based in New York, $1.1 billion plus expenses related to the transaction, Dover said.

''The key here is what's happening to Japanese savings and the fear that ordinary Japanese are looking to send their cash abroad in droves.'' **********The yen's slow erosion over the last few months has contributed to a surge in the Government's already large surplus in the current account, which measures the difference between income from foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net capital investment. **********Few have been paying attention, however, to the even larger outflows from capital and investment accounts since last spring, a strong indication that Japanese households are beginning to seek higher returns and less volatility in other currencies. **********Mr. Barrow noted that while the current account surplus has been running at one trillion to 1.5 trillion yen a month, according to Government figures issued in July, Japan's capital and investment accounts are running deficits of 2 to 2.5 trillion yen a month, reflecting a net outflow of money. **********''While they're earning more foreign currency from trade, it seems they're only too willing to see even greater sums flowing back out to take advantage of higher yields elsewhere,'' he said. **********One of the biggest factors in the decision last month by Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, to put Japan's triple-A rating on review for a possible downgrading was concern that the household sector had joined the flight to other currencies. **********''Of particular concern is the potential for volatile portfolio shifts into foreign currency assets by Japanese residents in the post-Big Bang environment,'' Moody's said in its news release, referring to sweeping financial reform measures that went into effect on April 1. **********And traders worry that the Government statistics fail to fully capture the flight from yen to dollars or other currencies. A shift of individual savings out of yen and into other currencies may not show up in the Government numbers because the money may never leave the country. Instead, it may sit in a foreign currency account at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Citibank, Sumitomo Bank and other banks that offer such accounts. **********It is difficult to get a read on how big that shift is, however, since most banks refuse to disclose breakdowns of foreign-currency deposit accounts and yen deposit accounts. **********Japanese bank officials contend that April's financial reform measures did not really enhance the ability of Japanese depositors to shift their savings into dollars and other currencies, but they do concede a marked uptick in demand for foreign-currency accounts since then. **********Until this spring, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was almost the only Japanese bank to promote foreign-currency accounts aggressively. Katsumi Tsuiji, a Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi spokesman, said the demand for those accounts had accelerated since April, although the increase was somewhat modest because the bank already had a significant part of the foreign-currency deposit market. **********Mr. Tsuiji declined, however, to disclose the amount in foreign-currency deposits, as did a spokesman for Citibank. **********Sumitomo Bank began offering foreign-currency deposit accounts in five different currencies last year, in advance of the financial reforms. A spokesman said that from March until the end of July, the amount of deposits held in foreign-currency accounts had increased 150 percent. **********Few believe the Government is prepared to step in and try to stem that tide. In the past, intervention has taken place only in advance of a significant policy development, and there is no new policy in sight. **********Indeed, various senior officials of the ruling party have expressed dissatisfaction with the yen's direction in recent days, but to no avail. Today, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hinted obliquely that the Government might move to prop up the yen, and Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Minister of Finance for international affairs, suggested that the Group of Seven industrial nations would join in support of the Japanese currency. **********Mr. Miyazawa, noting the negative impact that the slide in the yen is having on other Asian currencies, said, ''I couldn't speak of specific levels, but it is necessary to intervene if the market is not moving in an orderly fashion.'' **********The markets assume that as the yen weakens, Japanese exports become more competitive with those of other Asian countries, and concern is mounting that the Chinese will be forced to devalue their currency, the yuan, in spite of pledges not to do so. **********A report today in The Financial Times said the Chinese Government was selling yen, in a major shift in its foreign-currency portfolio. **********''The next key point is 150'' yen to the dollar, said Hiroshi Sakuma, a foreign-exchange trader at Barclays Bank in Tokyo. ''That's the target point for a lot of investors and speculators because that's the point that many think the Chinese will have to devalue.'' **********Some economists and strategists suggest that allowing the yen to weaken is, in fact, the Government's newest plan to reinvigorate the deteriorating Japanese economy, in spite of the stern tone of disapproval emanating from the Ministry of Finance. **********Economists like Paul Krugman have argued that Japan should deliberately unleash inflation, which would encourage consumers and companies to spend rather than save in fear that their purchasing power would be diluted in the future. **********Craig Chudler, chief strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. said: ''This could be the economic policy they're after. If they allow the currency to depreciate, it should be inflationary by making imports more expensive, and many economists believe Japan desperately needs inflation to get the economy going again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/26/business/economic-calendar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calendar", "print_headline": "Economic Calendar", "body_text": " **********Expected dates for the release of major economic indicators this week. **********MONDAY **********None **********TUESDAY **********Consumer Confidence   Oct. **********WEDNESDAY **********Durable Goods Orders   Sept. **********THURSDAY **********Weekly Jobless Claims **********FRIDAY **********New-Home Sales   Sept. **********G.D.P.   3d Qtr."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/business/executive-changes-115630.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********FLEMING COS., Oklahoma City, said Robert E.

Fyodorov, who was chief tax collector and top economic policy maker, was removed from both positions, the Kremlin said. **********His dismissal follows other resignations that have made a shambles of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov's promise to assemble a well-oiled professional team. **********''The formation of the Government is going very badly,'' said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko Party who promoted Mr. Primakov for Prime Minister. ''These people cannot work together.'' **********In many respects this does not seem to be the most auspicious moment to discharge an official who symbolizes a tough-minded approach to collecting taxes and has credibility with the West. Russia is desperate for revenue. Tax receipts are plummeting along with the ruble. Recent efforts at privatization have been a bust. The sale of state property has raised 16 percent of the goal for January to August. **********Russia also badly needs a clear economic plan. International Monetary Fund officials who recently met with Mr. Primakov and his aides said they left without a coherent idea of the economic program beyond printing money. **********The Government is not entirely devoid of liberals. Mikhail M. Zadornov, recently appointed as Finance Minister, is a free-market advocate. And Aleksandr Y. Livshits, a former Finance Minister, appears to be angling for a high job. **********But they are just a part of a coalition that includes a Communist central banker, a Communist aide for economic policy and a left-leaning Agriculture Minister. **********Still the story of Mr. Fyodorov is an especially vivid case study in the  Government's inability to chart an economic course, put the right person in charge and stick with the plan and the person. **********Western economists were heartened in May when Mr. Fyodorov was tapped as head of the State Tax Service. A wealthy investment banker and former Finance Minister, Mr. Fyodorov was brash, self-assured and avidly pro-capitalist. **********No sooner was he in office than he instructed his aides to compile a list of the 1,000 richest citizens. He put himself on the list and ordered Government audits of everybody on it. **********He started a campaign to collect back taxes from Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly that has long enjoyed cozy ties at the highest level of the Government. Mr. Fyodorov joined police officers in publicity-making raids of tax deadbeats. **********After the ruble collapsed and Mr. Yeltsin discharged Sergei M. Kiriyenko as Prime Minister last month, Mr. Fyodorov rode out the storm. For a brief moment he emerged as the point man for the Government's effort to pull itself out of the crisis. **********The worldly Mr. Fyodorov met the I.M.F. over the billions of dollars that  Russia hopes to receive in loans.  He also promoted the ''currency board'' approach, in which the ruble  exchange rate would be fixed, pegged to a hard currency like the dollar. Domingo F. Cavallo, the former Argentine Economics Minister who conquered soaring inflation in his country, described Mr. Fyodorov as a veritable soulmate on a visit here. **********But it was downhill from there.  After Mr. Primakov became Prime Minister, he began to reach out to the Communists, and they had a score to settle with Mr. Fyodorov. **********To placate the left, Viktor S. Gerashenko, the former central bank chairman who presided over the ruble devaluation in 1994, was reappointed to the post. Yury Maslyukov, a Communist, was made First Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for economic matters. **********But the Communists continued to bray for Mr. Fyodorov's head. ''The Communists and the Agrarians said that they could not possibly have him in the Government,'' said Tom Adshead, codirector of research at the United Financial Group, an investment company that Mr. Fyodorov founded. **********Still, Mr. Fyodorov seemed determined to soldier on. When rumors  circulated this month that he was out of a job, he issued a defiant statement insisting that he was not leaving. Even tonight a spokesman for Mr. Fyodorov voiced the hope that he would land another Government job. **********Mr. Fyodorov's is just the latest casualty in the political wars. On Friday Aleksandr Shohkin, a centrist and ally of former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, resigned after  10 days in office. He said he was leaving to protest the reappointment of Mr. Zadornov, who was Finance Minister when Russia devalued the ruble in August.

Local industrial and agricultural production has dropped 22 percent in the last four years. Doctors, teachers and most factory workers have not been paid in months and their salaries, when they get them, are on the average a paltry $110 a month. **********Bad news, on the other hand, arrives regularly. And this week, while the ruble tumbled, it was coming in by the truckful as shipments of imported goods pulled up to Kaluga's crowded street market with prices on Turkish jackets, Polish boots and Korean blankets already as much as 10 percent higher. **********In the circumstances, what is a Kaluga street vendor to do? **********''We have raised our prices a little, but there is so much competition we can't raise them too high,'' said Oleg, 34, who left his job at a local military plant four years ago to try his hand at selling shoes. ''If you raise them too high,'' added Oleg, who would not give his last name, ''people won't buy because they just don't have the money.'' **********As the value of the ruble fell after the Russian Government's sudden shift in economic policy, people here in Kaluga, 100 miles south of Moscow, were poised for the worst. Many flocked to the local offices of Russia's Government-backed savings bank, some to withdraw funds, others to switch their accounts from rubles to dollars, which, to their relief, they discovered they could do. Still others found refuge in jewelry shops. Only a few managed to exchange rubles to dollars before local currency offices were shut down early Monday afternoon. **********Four days after the crisis hit, early signs of panic had subsided. When the currency offices reopened on Wednesday, the ruble was trading at roughly 7.9 to the dollar, a drop of 15 percent from last week's levels, but less than the 30 percent plunge some had feared. **********Prices were going up, but in a country where everyone, including the the Government and the banks, is running out of money, that does not necessarily mean inflation; it just means people are going to have to do with even less than the little they have. **********''In Russia, it is just a matter of survival,'' said Lena Petrukhina, 27, who sells shoes in a tent next to Oleg. ''Right now, things are very tense. I don't see how it will get any better, if it ever does get better. '' **********For most people in Kaluga, this week has been just another chapter in a crisis that dates from 1991, to the collapse of Communism and of a way of life that was, if nothing else, secure. Since then, they have lived through worse: the soaring inflation of the early 1990's utterly wiped out people's Soviet-era savings. This time, their savings accounts have remained secure -- at least for now. **********What has made this week's events so painful, and so bitter, was the reminder that the seven-year crisis is not over, not by a long shot. A year ago, the Kaluga regional government thought that by 1999 the region would be on the threshold of economic growth. Last week, its expectations, already lowered, were that the economy next year would stay at 1998 levels. By the end of this week, Maksim Akimov, deputy director of the region's economic department, was predicting things would only get worse. **********Mr. Akimov, 28, is not so worried about inflation, or the value of the ruble, which he, like many others, now believes will be held at more or less its current level by the Central Bank. His worries are about the freeze on capital investment, domestic and foreign, that this region of 1.1 million sorely needs to pull itself out of its economic mess. **********''The main problem is how debt crisis affects investments,'' he said. ''The reaction of capital markets will be, 'Better not to even touch Russia,' and who can blame them? If I were an investor, I would take my money and run.'' **********Like so much of Russia, the Kaluga region was heavily dependent on the military-industrial complex,  which here, as elsewhere, has sunk into terminal depression. Factories that once employed 14,000 now employ 4,000 and those that still have jobs have seen paychecks buried in a mountain of backed-up debt, starting with $34 million that the Russian Defense Ministry still owes the region for unpaid orders. **********''I can name you 10 factories in the whole region that pay their workers on time,'' said Yuri Rastorguyev, business manager at the local government newspaper Vest. ''So you can understand, if people haven't gotten their salaries in six months, and they raise prices, where does that leave them? Basically, the system is in total collapse.'' **********Yet people do survive, or as Denis Skyanik, a 25-year-old violinist, noted, ''Nobody is going to die of hunger.'' In his case, he supplements his 300-ruble monthly salary from the Kaluga Orchestra by playing on a street corner, weather permitting. He also plays at parties. ''Russians like to drink and have fun,'' he said. ''So that business will always be there.'' **********To make ends meet, Igor Babichev, editor of a private financial newspaper that by his own admission makes no money, sold shoes, imported Spanish wine and dabbled in real estate before settling on a side business of campaign consulting. ''Everybody here has a hobby,'' he said almost cheerily, ''and no one will tell you how much they earn.'' **********Getting a handle on Kaluga's economy is one the lcoal government's next orders of business. According to Mr. Akimov, traders on the Kaluga street markets will soon be required to install cash registers, to issue sales slips and to pay a single simplified tax. **********''For some people, it will make life easier,'' he said, ''but there is no doubt it will be a lot harder for those who aren't paying any taxes, and they are many.'' **********The drop in the value of the ruble could prove a boon for local industries that produce consumer products, from building materials to food processing, Mr. Akimov said. But such industries account for only 13 percent of local production, another harsh legacy from the Soviet era, and many of those have done little to adapt to a market economy. **********As it is, Kaluga gets 40 percent of its food and 70 percent of its consumer goods from abroad, a fact that many see as an example of their economic humiliation. **********''Before, in Soviet times, people had money, but they had nothing to buy,'' said Aleksei Slabov, a political commentator for the newspaper Vest. ''Now they can buy anything they want, but they have no money. Basically, it comes to the same thing. Nothing has changed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/23/business/fed-by-the-hand-that-bites.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Whitaker", "pub_date": "1998-09-23", "snippet": "Many more entrepreneurs in recent years find that govt is not simply the enemy and has more to offer than red tape; multi-million dollar companies now do everything from operate prisons to deliver mail to American troops overseas; there is a whole...", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed by the Hand That Bites", "print_headline": "Fed by the Hand That Bites", "body_text": " **********FIFTY years ago, Lou Witzeman watched as a neighbor's house in an unincorporated area of Phoenix burned to the ground.

While continuing to work as a reporter, he formed a one-engine, four-person fire department that sold subscriptions for service to his neighbors. **********In 1969, his company, Rural-Metro Corporation, began operating an ambulance service separate from the fire company. The service has grown into a company with annual revenues of $476 million and has shifted its focus to developing public-private partnerships. **********In recent years, many more entrepreneurs are finding that  the government is not simply the enemy and has more to offer than red tape. Multimillion dollar companies now do everything from operate prisons to deliver mail to American troops overseas. And small-business owners like Ben Farmer, a respiratory therapist, have taken over less weighty assignments. Mr. Farmer, for example, has been operating the paddle-boat rides for the last five years on the Downtown Canal in Indianapolis, where municipal services have been privatized extensively through competitive bidding. **********''There is a whole market now of firms whose primary business is contract services for the government,'' said Adrian Moore, a director at the Reason Public Policy Institute, a nonprofit center in Los Angeles that focuses on privatization. ''It's been around for a long time in the simplified form of janitorial services or purchasing contracts, but in the last 5 to 10 years it's gotten a lot more complex.'' **********In many cases, what started as small entrepreneurial efforts have grown into huge corporations. The Corrections Corporation of America, started by a business executive, a lawyer and a corrections official in Tennessee, is a good model. **********C.C.A., as it is known, was founded in 1983 in Nashville and got off the ground by operating a juvenile center in Memphis. It is now a business  responsible for 78 prison-related ventures that encompass 63,308 beds,  about 3.5 percent of the more than 1.8 million jail and prison beds in the United States. **********''The private sector looks at the Federal Government as a new market,'' said Robert L. Raasch, the  chairman of the Coalition for Taxpayer Value. ''If the Federal Government looks at ways to save money, it's going to look to private sector bidders or entrepreneurs.'' **********The coalition is spearheading the push for legislation that would result in privatization of what are considered commercial jobs in the Federal Government. The measure would push Federal agencies to decide whether to turn these commercial activities over to private companies. **********Mr. Raasch said that his goal goes beyond privatization. He wants the Federal Government to stop taking business away from the private sector. As examples he used the Veterans Administration's hospitals competing for laundry contracts. **********''Our official position is that anything that is not inherently governmental, like providing advice to the President or national security, should be done privately,'' Mr. Raasch said. **********Organizations representing Federal workers, however, have opposed the measure, saying that it is based on a faulty assumption -- that making a government function private always saves money. **********Opponents note that there are plenty of cases where privatization or extensive outside contracting has led to shoddy work and higher costs. In the private prison industry, cases of brutality, neglect and insufficient services have raised questions about  prisons being a bottom-line business. **********Companies handling government business is not new, but in recent years the relationships have become more entwined. For example, when United States troops went into Bosnia in 1995, a private Houston company did the troops' laundry, provided their meals and helped establish base camps. **********The company, Brown & Root Services, won a five-year contract in 1992 to provide logistical services to forces deployed overseas because the military, after downsizing, began farming out support services. The contract has also taken the company to Somalia, Zaire and Haiti. **********''They've done mail delivery, run shuttle services, provided potable water and taken care of solid waste,'' said Joan Kibler, the public-affairs officer for the Trans-Atlantic Program Center of the Army Corps of Engineers, which ran the service. **********Representatives of small businesses complain that the  the opportunities for them are more limited. ''Larger businesses are more likely to do government contracting,'' said Dan Danner, a vice president of Federal Government relations with the National Federation of Independent Business. For what he called the ''smallest of the small,'' local and Federal governments are still more of a problem -- think regulations and taxes -- than a benefit. **********But Mr. Witzeman, who has retired but remains on the board of Rural-Metro, says that he still sees plenty of room for entrepreneurs to explore business relationships with all government levels. **********''I didn't expect it to be this at the beginning,'' he said, considering how his company has grown into a major corporation by working with local governments. ''But as I saw the trend developing I got less and less surprised. I wish I could be here 50 years from now to see where it's going.

Several people close to the companies who were reached for comment expressed surprise that the transaction was not completed. **********''There is no deal with ITT,'' Barbara Posner, the vice president of communications for Tenneco, said last night. ''We are not acquiring their brake and chassis unit as rumored.'' She declined to comment further. **********Executives at the companies had been in talks for more than a month. **********ITT Industries, based in White Plains, designs and manufactures automobile products, including brake and chassis systems and electronics for the military market. The European automotive division has been on the auction block since March. It is estimated that the division employs 16,700 people and has annual sales of about $2.2 billion. **********In early June, several companies were said to be interested in buying all or part of the European operations, including Delphi Automotive Systems, Visteon Automotive Systems, Siemens A.G. and Tenneco. Several companies took plant tours to inspect the operations then. **********The unit would have been a significant addition to Tenneco's automotive line. Tenneco entered the auto parts business with the acquisition of Walker Manufacturing, a muffler maker, in 1967. The Tenneco Automotive division, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill., had 1997 sales of $3.2 billion. It not only sells mufflers, but Monroe brand shock absorbers, too."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/24/technology/user-s-guide-web-shopping-not-for-the-picky.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Slatalla", "pub_date": "1998-09-24", "snippet": "Article on advantages and disadvantages of grocery shopping on World Wide Web; drawing (M)", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Web Shopping?

Not for the Picky", "body_text": " **********ON days when life is under control in our household, either my husband or I will take the baby to shop at a friendly family-owned grocery. We all benefit from such leisurely outings. Clementine always gets a cookie (iced) from the owner, who also remembers to ask us how our older daughters are liking school so far this year. We bask in the amazing luxury of checkout  clerks who cheerfully insist on bagging all the groceries. **********But more often, our household suffers shopping emergencies. Alerted by the baby sitter that the premises are devoid of some absolutely vital item, I will jump up from my desk to rush out to buy, say, diapers. **********In theory, that pattern should make me an ideal candidate for on-line shopping -- at least for mundane, nonperishable provisions. After all, I could conveniently arrange for the delivery of whole truckloads of diapers -- and avoid unduly interrupting my work or appearing in public in my lucky writing sweatpants (paint-spattered on one leg). **********But in reality, I am as reluctant as the next shopper to tinker with my habits. That's because shopping isn't really about shopping. It's about defining ourselves through the acquisition of goods, the items that tell the rest of the world about our wants, needs and tastes, including our willingness to eat generic-brand corn niblets. **********So as I browsed through on-line shopping sites recently, I realized that I would need an incentive to make an actual purchase, some prize or reward. Something like---- hey, a chance to earn free movie tickets. **********I had arrived at www.freeride.com, one of a growing number of marketing Web sites that award prizes to on-line shoppers. The more you buy from Freeride partners like www.netgrocer.com, www.books.com or www.magmall.com, the more points you earn. Freeride users who accumulate enough points can redeem them for a $20 gift certificate at Tower Records (1,000 points), a $5 gift certificate at Red Lobster (275 points) or even a Playboy T-shirt (800 points). Me? I opened a Freeride account with the relatively modest goal of getting a free ticket for ''There's Something About Mary''(460 points) before it left town. **********There is nothing new about Freeride's brand of marketing, of course. Today's on-line techniques borrow heavily from the same marketing efforts that led to the trading stamp craze that began throughout the United States and Canada at the turn of the century, according to David Monot, a historian and author of ''Store Wars: Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing 1890-1939'' (University of Toronto Press, 1996).  In those days, the tedium of routine shopping was replaced by the excitement of earning stamps for purchases, then pasting them into books. Full books could be redeemed for prizes. The trading stamp era ended in scandal after some unscrupulous stamp companies didn't pony up the rewards they had promised shoppers. **********But after I called Freeride's founder, Jordan Stanley, I was confident that Freeride was a legitimate business -- and not just because I learned, coincidentally, that Mr. Stanley lived in the same town I do. And not because every time I go to the Little League fields, I practically drive by his house, which would make it really convenient to knock on his door to complain if free movie passes failed to arrive promptly in the mail. No, what endeared Mr. Stanley to me was that he gave me tips for earning Freeride points without actually buying anything. **********How I love to beat the system. By filling out surveys Mr. Stanley told me about, I earned 55 points. By clicking on any of thedesignated shopping sites promoted on the Freeride site, I could earn 5 more points. **********Mr. Stanley even told me how to set up a second Freeride account to get around paying a $4.99 shipping fee that Netgrocer wanted to charge me to get six cases of 48 diapers delivered to my door by Federal Express. ''We just started a new promotion --  it waives the shipping,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''Go to www.att.net, click on the Freeride ad that rotates on that site, then set up a new Freeride account in your husband's name and go to Netgrocer,'' he said. **********But even with the head start given me by Mr. Stanley, I wavered. The real problem was one of choice: On the day I shopped, Netgrocer's best value in the category of diapers was 48 Pampers Baby Dry Stretch Size 4, packaged in a green bag, for $13.49: about what I would pay at the store (once the shipping was waived). But our regular brand is Huggies Ultratrim Girls Size 4, in a pink bag, which would cost $14.58 for the same number of diapers, a dollar more than I would pay at the store. **********I felt paralyzed by indecision: Should I get the price I want or the diapers I want? I phoned Daniel Miller, a British anthropologist, for guidance, and he made me feel much better. ''Shopping isn't just about defining yourself,'' Dr. Miller said. ''It's really about defining your relationships to the people closest to you, in this case, your infant.'' **********Dr. Miller, who spent a year studying the shopping habits of North London families for his new book, ''A Theory of Shopping'' (Cornell University Press), was confident that my crisis was a common case of ''infant obsession.'' That syndrome is characterized by the creation of a largely fictitious list of the infant's likes and dislikes. **********''Parents develop strong views about the particular nature of their infants,'' Dr. Miller explained. ''That comes out with items of clothing -- what an infant supposedly likes to wear or doesn't like to wear -- and with particular foodstuffs.'' In case I might have thought that Dr. Miller was being too critical of obsessed parents, he added, ''It's a way of expressing love.'' **********He was right, of course. Anyone can see that my baby is the sort who likes to wear diapers that come in a pink bag, not green, and it makes more sense to buy them at the store than over the Internet, at least for now. With that problem solved, I logged off, never earning the points I needed for a movie ticket. But we continue to reap the rewards of off-line shopping. Both Clementine and her father came home from the store yesterday licking icing off their fingers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/business/the-markets-stocks-dow-edges-higher-as-curtain-drops-on-a-troubled-week.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-07-25", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average rises 4.38 points, to 8,937.36; Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rises 1.05, to 1140.80; Nasdaq composite index falls 4.23, to 1,930.99; graphs of Dow Jones average; tables (M)", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Edges Higher as Curtain Drops on a Troubled Week", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS; Dow Edges Higher as Curtain Drops on a Troubled Week", "body_text": " **********Stocks seesawed yesterday to finish mixed, closing out the worst week for the market since January on investor concern that corporate profit growth is faltering. **********Gateway led a decline in computer stocks after reporting unexpectedly weak earnings, while Pepsico gained after saying Thursday that it might  spin off some bottling operations.

Numbers and procedures are not delineated, and the text speaks only of ''specific, detailed procedures which will be developed given the special nature of the presidential sites.'' **********Mr. Annan went to Baghdad with instructions to delineate presidential residences within the eight presidential sites, which include many other buildings. It was unclear in the text, officials said, if he had succeeded, or whether these ''special procedures'' had to apply to the larger sites and not merely the palaces or residences. **********But the text of the agreement, after standard references to the sovereignty and dignity of Iraq, does say that ''the Government of Iraq reconfirms its acceptance of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council,'' and that ''the Government of Iraq undertakes to accord Unscom and the I.A.E.A. immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access in conformity with the resolutions.'' **********Toward the end, the text also says, as Iraq wanted, that the lifting of tough economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 is ''obviously of paramount importance.'' **********But criticism of the deal was quick to come, with some Republicans saying Mr. Clinton had abdicated the making of foreign policy to the United Nations and could once again be snookered by Mr. Hussein. **********The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, voiced concern that the Administration had ''subcontracted'' its foreign policy to Mr. Annan. **********''I was worried that this initiative by Annan was going to put the President in a box, and that's exactly what's happened,'' Mr. Lott said. ''He's in a very difficult position now to say, 'Oh, no, this is not good enough.' '' **********The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said he had no qualms with the United Nations acting as a mediator. ''I think as long as the Secretary General is operating within a framework established by the American President, we have nothing to fear,'' he said. **********With Congress just returning from a 10-day recess, Democrats and Republicans gave guarded comments  before having examined the details of the agreement. ''We can only judge those details when we see them,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. **********''I have grave misgivings about this,'' Mr. Lieberman continued.  ''But if in fact there is an agreement in writing that provides for unlimited access by U.N. inspectors to all of the sites in Iraq, then I think it's going to be very hard for us to do anything but to let that agreement go into effect.'' **********Other senators complained that Mr. Hussein had badly outmaneuvered the United States. ''From the outset, the U.S. believed this was a military contest, and Saddam Hussein believed it was a political fight,'' Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who just returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, said in an interview. ''In retrospect, he was probably right. It may be incredible for most Americans to accept, but Saddam Hussein actually won the public relations battle.'' **********Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, spoke for many of his colleagues when he listed questions about unresolved issues: **********''What is the long-term policy, and where do we go in the long run here? What will the force deployment level be? How will we guarantee compliance? What happens if he doesn't comply down the road? How do we avoid this ratcheting up on an annual basis and sort of continual tweaking that Saddam Hussein seems to enjoy putting the United States to?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/business/market-watch-you-too-can-own-a-bad-bank-loan.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1998-07-26", "snippet": "Edward Wyatt column on faltering of some US companies as result of Asian financial crisis; Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan again warns that bad bank loans could hamper US employment and income; graph (M)", "word_count": 544, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "You, Too, Can Own A Bad Bank Loan", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; You, Too, Can Own A Bad Bank Loan", "body_text": " **********Wall Street saw a darker strain of trickle-down economics last week as several companies with little to no direct exposure to the Asian malaise warned that their businesses were beginning to suffer. **********Exhibit A was Computer Associates. A mere 5 percent of the software company's revenues come from Asian customers. But big multinational clients are not ordering as much of Computer Associates' mainframe software, apparently because the Asian decline is hurting their operations. **********It is not hard to imagine the trend continuing, funneling down to outfits that depend on Computer Associates or on the spending of its employees -- the company that cleans its office buildings, for instance, or the guys that fix the copy machines, or even the corner coffee bar where employees stop in the morning. **********Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, apparently agrees. ''We have yet to see the full effects of the crisis in East Asia on U.S. employment and income,'' he told Congress last week. **********Tucked into Mr. Greenspan's comments was a reprise of a recent Fed warning to banks that the loans they have eagerly been  making to businesses could come back to haunt them if the economy slows, whatever the cause. **********That problem could funnel down, too. Many banks have shrugged off the Fed's warning because they have unloaded one-quarter or more of their lower-quality loans onto ''loan participation funds.'' Generally, those loans are considered below investment grade, meaning that they have been made to companies whose prospects raise doubts about their ability to repay. Moreover, the loans themselves are illiquid and cannot be resold easily. **********But the funds, also known as ''floating rate'' or ''prime rate'' funds, have been snapped up by individuals seeking higher yields than those offered by short-term Treasuries or money market funds. **********Last month, in the biggest such offering in a decade, Van Kampen American Capital raised $1.6 billion for a new fund that invests almost solely in floating-rate loans -- and, moreover, borrows money to leverage its bets. Most of the big mutual fund companies, like Franklin Templeton, Merrill Lynch, Eaton Vance and Aim, offer similar funds; others, including Fidelity Investments, are considering joining the fray. **********The amount of loans held by these funds grew fivefold over the last three years, to $26 billion at the end of the first quarter, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation. Over the same period, the assets in equity mutual funds merely doubled, and the assets in bond funds rose just 25 percent. **********Because the funds are not able to turn the loans quickly into cash when investors want to redeem their shares, most of the funds allow investors to withdraw money only periodically, generally once a quarter. In doing so, the funds offer to repurchase a certain number of shares -- say, 5 percent of the fund's total. If more investors want to cash out, too bad; each shareholder gets only a portion of his shares redeemed. **********Making illiquid loans to companies with questionable ability to repay is not necessarily the best business to be in when a crisis hits. If the Asian malaise spreads more broadly in the United States, many of the loans held by these funds could turn sour. Panicky investors could have a difficult time getting their money out. And the pain will have trickled all the way down."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/world/indonesia-cuts-timor-force-but-islanders-are-skeptical.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-29", "snippet": "Indonesia begins withdrawing 1,000 combat troops from East Timor, but critics and residents remain skeptical about the more than 11,000 troops and police officers who will continue to patrol territory; photo; map (M)", "word_count": 583, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Indonesia Cuts Timor Force But Islanders Are Skeptical", "print_headline": "Indonesia Cuts Timor Force But Islanders Are Skeptical", "body_text": " **********Indonesia began withdrawing 1,000 combat troops from East Timor today, but critics and residents remained skeptical about the more than 11,000 troops and police officers who will continue to patrol the territory. **********The highly publicized withdrawal is an attempt to demonstrate Jakarta's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the fate of the former Portuguese colony, which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. Since then the disputed territory has been the scene of fierce fighting between security forces and separatists, that along with disease and starvation, has left an estimated 200,000 people dead. During the period since annexation, the Indonesian military has been accused of repeated human rights abuses against the people of East Timor. Today 398 departing troops, representing the elite Special Forces and the Strategic Reserves Command, boarded a vessel docked in the harbor here in the  capital while several hundred residents watched from behind an iron fence. **********''We are removing the combat troops because the number of rebels in the jungle is getting smaller,'' said the military's information officer, Capt. Tri Yoga Budi, who estimated the current number of rebels at fewer than 200. **********While the threat from rebels seeking independence for the area may have been reduced, the decision to pull out the combat troops is believed to have more to do with the talks between Indonesia and Portugal planned for Aug. 4 and 5 in New York under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary General. **********Requests for demilitarization have also come from Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations special envoy for East Timor who recently visited the territory, and from the Roman Catholic Bishop for the territory, Carlos Ximenes Belo, who has repeatedly called for freedom of movement on the island, which is 1,300 miles east of Jakarta. **********''As long as there are soldiers there will be threats,'' said Manuel Carrascalao, a founding member of the broad-based Movement for the Reconciliation and Unity of the East Timorese People, a new group that favors a referndum to determine the future of the territory. **********Residents and activists said that security officials were still stopping East Timorese at random and that the military retained a presence in each of the villages. **********''The soldiers are repressive as usual,'' said Anis Neves of the local Rights Foundation. **********He questioned the need to keep on so many troops if so few rebels remained to pose a threat. **********The official answer is that the troops will be employed in the territory's ''development.'' **********''The soldiers help the farmers with planting, some help teach and others are involved with development activities,'' said Lieut. Col. Saragi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. **********Mr. Carrascalao said only a complete withdrawal of troops would lead to peace in East Timor, where 85 percent of the population is Catholic. Indonesia is mostly Muslim. **********''The East Timorese don't have a problem with religious differences or with the Indonesians,'' he said. **********Mr. Carrascalao called the troop withdrawal a ''charade'' staged for the outside world at a time when the new administration under President B. J. Habibie has offered the territory a degree of autonomy in return for international recognition of East Timor as a part of Indonesia. **********The United Nations still recognizes Lisbon as the administrative authority over the territory. **********Jakarta's officials have ruled out the possibility of a referendum on East Timor's fate. **********''There have never been any problems solved by referendum,'' said Gov.

But today it is a placid outpost in a more unified Europe: a home for the European Parliament, and a mecca for cross-border shoppers. **********So it is not surprising that the European single currency, the euro, arrived here well before its official introduction this Friday. At the Cora supermarket, everything from bananas to televisions have been priced in euros (as well as in French francs) for months. At upscale restaurants like Roma, euro-pricing on menus is a fashion must. **********And residents like Michel Raymond, who shops for Grand Marnier in France but for port wine in Germany, are opening euro checking accounts right after the New Year. ''It will make things simpler for everybody,'' said Mr. Raymond, a retired French businessman. ''Some things are cheaper here and others are cheaper on the German side. This will make the payments easier.'' **********After decades of dreams, diplomacy and delays, the euro is suddenly real. On Thursday 11 European countries are to lock their exchange rates to the euro, now worth about $1.17, and cede to the new European Central Bank the power to set interest rates and monetary policy. **********On the street it may look as if little has happened. But currency conversion represents the most important step in Europe's long quest for political unity. In getting to this point, the 11 euro nations for the first time have adopted a common economic policy that has reined in public spending, reduced debt and tamed inflation. **********This achievement has seriously altered the political debate; indeed, governments in Germany, France and Italy have fallen in large part because of the spending cutbacks required to create the euro. Business strategy has been transformed, and more residents and visitors are thinking of Europe as a single place instead of a jigsaw of nationalities and a hodge-podge of currencies and laws. **********Today's German marks, French francs, Italian lire and eight other currencies may be used for three and a half years more. (Euro notes and coins arrive on Jan. 1, 2002.) Local currencies are to be removed from circulation by July 1, 2002. **********European stock and bond trades will be denominated entirely in euros, starting on Monday. All transactions between banks, which is frequently how Europeans pay their bills, will be in euros, even within the same country. Bank customers can write checks in euros, and many credit-card purchases will be calculated in euros. Euro travelers checks are coming. **********Though Americans are largely bystanders, the euro will affect them, too. Travelers will be spared the necessity of changing dollars into different currencies, and currency risks will be reduced for money managers. That alone is expected to yield substantial savings. **********While the euro was once viewed as a weakling because of doubts that Spain and Italy would have the discipline to get into fiscal trim, all signs now suggest that the euro will start off strong and may come to rival the dollar as a reserve currency held by central banks around the world. If that happens, economists say, it could push up American interest rates slightly. It could also make European goods more expensive for Americans. **********The new currency may also be a means for Europe to compete more strongly with the United States: The move to a unified market and a single currency has forced the transformation of Europe's biggest industries. Many are merging with rivals to cut costs; others are selling businesses to refocus on their strengths. And quite a few, like DaimlerChrysler A.G., have been doing both. **********One major country that is not party to the euro is Britain, which has always viewed itself as separate from Europe. It is taking a wait-and-see attitude because of public fears that using the euro would erode Britain's independence. **********British businesses definitely favor the currency, however, and worry that they will suffer a disadvantage by holding on to the pound. **********But Prime Minister Tony Blair insists that Britain will consider using the euro after the next round of national elections, which are likely by 2002, and only after a national referendum. **********The Origins **********Postwar Dreams, Post-Cold-War Fact **********Why did the 11 other nations go to all the trouble? **********The idea of a single currency dates back to the 1950's, when postwar diplomats like Jean Monnet, president of a precursor to the European Union, sketched out sweeping visions for economic and political unification. The idea was that the more each nation relied on the others for economic and political security, the more reluctant they would be to send their armies into battle. **********But the real impetus came with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. The prospect of a reunited German powerhouse alarmed many Western European governments, and Francois Mitterrand, then the President of France, pressed his German counterpart, Helmut Kohl: France would support the reunification if Mr. Kohl would commit his Government to replacing the mark with a single currency administered by an independent central bank. **********''After reunification, a lot of the neighbors around Germany were afraid that it might become politically and economically too strong,'' said Peter Wolf-Koppen, who oversees euro projects at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''They first tried to make a political union, but they failed. A monetary union was the best they could do.'' **********Mr. Kohl quickly became the euro's strongest champion, driven in part by memories of World War II. **********''I have often been told that the euro was a technocratic idea, invented by finance ministers,'' remarked Christian Noyer, vice president of the European Central Bank. ''That is clearly not the case. They had the simple idea that the money, the currency that people use every day, was a way to foster integration.'' **********Two years after the fall of the wall, in the Dutch city of Maastricht, European leaders reached a basic accord, with a strongly German imprint. Countries would have to meet strict limits on deficits and would have to bring inflation down to Germany's level, about 3 percent. **********But the Bundesbank, the influential German central bank, would take a back seat to an independent European Central Bank, which would focus on fighting inflation. **********The euro's proponents argue that it will make Europe more efficient and competitive because pricing differences will stand out. Trade will be enhanced because foreign-exchange risks will be minimal. (Europe abolished most tariffs and other trade restrictions six years ago.) **********But more important, supporters predict that the greater attention to prices will force cost-cutting by manufacturers. And while that may contribute to Europe's high unemployment, it may also initiate much-needed changes in costly regulations that hinder competitiveness today. **********''This can work like a reform program for Europe, and be very good for the competitiveness of Europe,'' said Jurgen Stark, vice president of the Bundesbank. ''On the one hand it is a great political challenge. But on the other it is a great opportunity for Europe to combine sound monetary and fiscal policy with more flexibility.'' **********The Change-Over **********Banks and Stores Do the Arithmetic **********In many respects, the euro will seem at first like a phantom currency because notes and coins will not circulate until Jan. 1, 2002, to give buyers and merchants time to adjust. And while euros will be usable beginning Monday in the ether of electronic payments, nobody can be forced to accept them before 2002. **********Many bankers argue that the long transition period makes the process needlessly costly and complicated. Instead of just converting to a new currency, banks have to change first to a system of dual currencies that will become obsolete in 2002. **********Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, says it will spend more than $200 million on the conversion during the next four years. ''The dual currency makes it much more expensive,'' said Peter Wolf-Koppen, at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. **********But merchants are reaching very different conclusions about how soon to price goods in euros. **********In France, supermarkets like Le Clerc and Caro are already posting all prices in euros. In Germany, where many are still hostile to trading in their solid marks for untested euros, big retailers are moving more slowly; most plan to post dual prices on some items right away, but they are reluctant to make a full conversion in 1999. **********For the moment, managers at the Cora hypermarket simply steer attention away from the euro price. A big sign promoting a widescreen television announces a price in French francs: FF 7,990.00. The euro price -- e 1,206.97 -- is printed in only small letters on the price tag. **********In part because of marketing uncertainties, some consumer-product companies are delaying the switch. **********''We're going to let someone else find out the answers on how to teach consumers about the euro,'' said Peter Csandi, a spokesman for Adidas, the sportswear company. ''We don't intend to be pioneers.'' **********But a growing number of Europe's biggest industrial companies are converting rapidly, convinced they can quickly recoup the cost by saving money on foreign-exchange dealings. DaimlerChrysler and Siemens plan to convert all their business systems early next year. They are also pressing suppliers to bill in euros, which is likely to speed up acceptance. **********The Future **********Not by Euros Alone Do Economies Live **********The euro has confounded naysayers ever since European leaders laid down the timetable in the early 1990's. As recently as four years ago, many were convinced that few countries would overcome national pride to abandon their currencies. **********When it became increasingly clear that monetary union would occur, most assumed that it would be limited to about eight ''core'' countries, led by Germany and France. But Europe's poorer and shakier countries -- Italy, Spain and Portugal -- started clamoring to join the club. And to the amazement of many, they brought their budget deficits and inflation rates down enough. **********But there could be some nasty surprises. Economic growth is uneven. There are inflation risks in fast-growing countries like Spain and Ireland; at the same time, growth is slowing in countries like Germany and France, where unemployment rates remain above 10 percent. **********The challenge for the new central bank is to set uniform interest rates that will foster growth everywhere. **********The political landscape has also changed profoundly. Some leading politicians who pushed for the euro are out of power now, casualties of voters' objections to relentless budget cutting, especially on social programs. New governments in Germany, Italy and France are not so beholden to the rules set out to create the euro. **********After Mr. Kohl and his center-right coalition were defeated last September by Gerhard Schroder and the left-of-center Social Democratic Party, the new Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, quickly became a vocal critic of both the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank. He argued that tight-money policies brought about by the euro were the real reason that European unemployment mostly remains high. **********Under the Maastricht Treaty, political leaders have no authority over the European Central Bank, which is led by a former Dutch central banker, Wim Duisenberg. And a separate treaty calls for huge fines on governments whose spending generates deficits of more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. The rules also say that once a nation enters the euro union, it cannot withdraw. **********In practice, many experts are skeptical that European leaders would impose such punishments. **********''Countries have to realize that the misbehaviors of one country can damage all the others,'' said Mr. Stark, the Bundesbank official. ''If a big country runs a high deficit, it is pretty clear the European Central Bank will have to react with a rate increase.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/27/business/milken-settles-sec-complaint-for-47-million.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1998-02-27", "snippet": "Michael R Milken, financier who used huge junk bond empire in 1980's to make or break a swath of big American companies, agrees to pay $47 million to settle SEC complaint that he had violated 1991 order barring him from securities industry for lif...", "word_count": 1147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Milken Settles S.E.C.

Milken, the financier who used a huge junk bond empire in the 1980's to make or break a swath of big American companies, agreed yesterday to pay $47 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that he had violated a 1991 order barring him from the securities industry for life. **********At the same time, in an apparently related deal, Federal prosecutors said they would not recommend new criminal charges against Mr. Milken for violating terms of his probation stemming from a criminal securities fraud conviction in 1990. **********In agreeing to settle with the S.E.C., Mr. Milken neither admitted nor denied its allegations that he had violated the 1991 order by offering advice to such financiers as Rupert Murdoch and Ronald O. Perelman on several transactions in recent years. And, with a net worth estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Milken can easily pay $47 million, a sum that represents fees received for his consulting work. **********During the years that Mr. Milken was advising Mr. Perelman and Mr. Murdoch, he was also on probation as part of the sentence for his conviction on the criminal charges. Prosecutors were investigating whether Mr. Milken had violated his probation after his release from prison in 1993 by continuing to provide securities advice, and as a result they successfully sought to extend his probation on several occasions. **********Prosecutors' continuing investigation into his activities threatened to put Mr. Milken back in prison for violation of probation. That probation will now apparently end. But he would still be unable to return to the securities industry. **********The settlement of the S.E.C. complaint was agreed on by lawyers for the S.E.C. and for Mr. Milken before Judge Milton Pollack in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday morning. **********Then, late yesterday, Mark F. Pomerantz, chief of the criminal division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, sent a letter to Judge Kimba M. Wood, who sentenced Mr. Milken in 1990 and has been overseeing his probation, saying that his office had decided not to recommend proceedings against Mr. Milken for violation of probation. The letter said that the United States Attorney's office ''concluded that the initiation of probation violation proceedings in this matter is not warranted by the existing evidence and by the law.'' **********Judge Wood sentenced Mr. Milken to 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to six counts of securities fraud, involving manipulation of the prices of securities and other illegal financial practices. He committed those crimes during his years at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a securities firm that Mr. Milken built into the dominant force in the junk bond market but that went bankrupt in 1990. Mr. Milken, however, served 22 months of that sentence, after Judge Wood reduced it. **********But Mr. Milken has remained on probation, and the United States Attorney's requests for several extensions of that probation over the last few years had raised the prospect that the Government might seek to return Mr. Milken to jail. The 51-year-old financier, who is suffering from prostate cancer that his advisers said yesterday was in remission, particularly feared returning to jail, associates say. **********Judge Wood's clerks forwarded copies of Mr. Pomerantz's letter to reporters, but did not say whether the judge might take further action. Stephen E. Kaufman, one of Mr. Milken's lawyers, declined to comment on the letter. **********The S.E.C. said in its complaint that Mr. Milken, and his company, the MC Group, had in two cases ''introduced companies, suggested business arrangements between them, participated in negotiations regarding the structure of such transactions, and securities issued in connection with these transactions, and received transaction-based compensation of $42 million.'' Such actions, the S.E.C. said, breached the commission's 1991 order barring Mr. Milken from associating with a securities broker. **********In a statement, Mr. Milken's lawyer, Richard V. Sandler, said Mr. Milken ''had taken legal advice before engaging in any consulting activities.'' **********''Mr. Milken,'' he added, ''is battling prostate cancer and has decided not to contest the S.E.C. allegations to determine who is right and who is wrong. Therefore, without admitting such allegations, or denying them, and without any findings of wrongdoing, Mr. Milken is returning the fees that he received with respect to the two transactions that are the subject of this action.'' **********The $47 million will go to the Treasury. It is not a fine but represents fees that Mr. Milken and his company earned for two transactions: In the first, they received $27 million for advising Bert C. Roberts Jr., the chairman of the MCI Communications Corporation, and Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, on a 1995 accord in which MCI agreed to invest $1 billion to $2 billion in the News Corporation. In the second, they were paid $15 million for advising Ronald O. Perelman, who controls Revlon Inc. and other businesses, on his acquisition of New World Communications, a television station and production company, from the News Corporation in 1996. The other $5 million  represents interest on these fees. **********Such fees are high, but not atypical, on Wall Street, where investment banks are paid for their advice calculated as small percentages of multibillion-dollar deals. Mr. Milken and his MC Group were ''integrally involved in the transaction between MCI and News Corp.,'' the S.E.C. said in its complaint. **********Though Mr. Milken can easily pay the $47 million, Dennis J. Block, a senior partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotschal & Manges, who was not involved in the case, said, ''It's quite an extraordinary amount of money and probably reflects his concern that he might have had his probation revoked.'' **********The regulatory action against Mr. Milken and his company made no mention of consulting by Mr. Milken regarding a third corporate deal that had attracted the attention of Government investigators in recent years: Time Warner's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting for $7.5 billion in 1996. There was apparently insufficient evidence to back S.E.C. allegations about this deal, in which Mr. Milken received a $50 million fee. **********''This is a guy who has been the subject of Government investigation for years,'' said Jeffrey B. Sklaroff, a partner at Greenberg, Traurig, a New York law firm, who was not involved in the case. ''At a certain point the Government believes that it has gotten more than a pound of flesh. Milken's also served jail time previously. It's hard for the Government to maintain an aggressive stance.

Aimers thought of the Liberal idea. Mr. Aimers had been through this fight before, which was why he helped found the Monarchist League of Canada, based in Toronto, more than 20 years ago. **********''This is a naive, fanciful project of some gutless wonders in Ottawa who don't want to attach their names to this,'' Mr. Aimers said. ''They should be more careful of what they let slip.'' **********There was a significant amount of backpedaling in the halls of Parliament after the first reports of the dump-the-Queen plan were released. Although the Prime Minister's office had made it clear that Mr. Chretien was anxious to hear what Canadians thought of the idea, in a year-end interview with the Canadian news magazine Maclean's, Mr. Chretien said that abolishing the monarchy was not a priority. **********''I have enough problems with the separatists in Quebec,'' Mr. Chretien said, ''I don't want to have problems with the monarchists in Ontario.'' **********And Sophie Galarneau, a spokeswoman for Mr. Chretien, said, ''While it's certainly true that the Prime Minister would like to know what Canadians think about it, this is not a Government project at this point.'' Although some officials, like Industry Minister John Manley, have openly espoused a republican Canada, Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray went on television to play down the idea. The Premier of the province of Prince Edward Island then said he would be the first to cast the one veto it would take from the provinces to block any such amendment. **********Columnists at some of Canada's largest newspapers gleefully took shots at the plan. Dan Gardner, writing in the Ottawa Citizen -- the newspaper that broke the story -- noted that the plan was billed as a visionary project to mark the year 2000. But, he wondered, ''Can't we just build a giant dome or something?'' **********In The Montreal Gazette, Tommy Schnurmacher, a columnist, called the idea of throwing out the Queen ''impertinent.'' **********Canada's relationship to the Queen is a complex one, similar to that of Australia, another member of the British Commonwealth seeking to come out from Britain's shadow. For several years, the Australians have engaged in a debate over whether to remove the Queen as head of state. **********Feelings toward the royal family are warmer in Canada than they are in Australia, said Mr. Aimers of the Monarchist League, at least in English-speaking Canada. While most Quebecers are cool to the crown, royal visits to the Maple Kingdom, as the Monarchists call it, almost always attract big crowds, and members of the royal family often vacation in Canada. **********While vowing allegiance to the Queen is considered by some Canadians to show a lack of independence, Mr. Aimers points out that under the Canadian Constitution, Queen Elizabeth is actually Canada's own monarch, quite separate and apart from being Queen of England or Queen of Australia, titles she also holds. And the Queen's role as head of state, he adds, ''is first and foremost the most significant distinction between Canada and the United States.'' **********On its Internet site (www.monarchist.ca), the Monarchist League sells stickers with pictures of the Queen that it suggests can be attached to letters to the Government to show support for the Maple Crown, and bumper stickers that say ''My Canada Includes the Monarchy.'' **********The Canadian writer Robertson Davies once called the crown ''the consecrated spirit of Canada.'' Despite changing times, monarchists want the Queen's profile to remain on all Canadian coins, and they insist the Queen is still a central figure in Canadian life. **********That much was proved quite smartly, Mr. Aimers said, when the country's immigration service retained the mention of the sovereign in the Canadian oath of citizenship that was recently updated. The oath, repeated by all immigrants who become Canadian citizens, still says, ''I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to Canada and Her Majesty, Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/21/business/worldbusiness/IHT-smithkline-and-american-home-discuss-creating-an.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1998-01-21", "snippet": "Stock prices of major international drug companies soared Tuesday in anticipation of a new round of takeover activity after SmithKline Beecham PLC said it was discussing a possible merger with American Home Products Corp..The combination, if compl...", "word_count": 3722, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SmithKline and American Home Discuss Creating an Industry Giant : Merger Talk Propels Drug Stocks", "print_headline": "SmithKline and American Home Discuss Creating an Industry Giant : Merger Talk Propels Drug Stocks", "body_text": " **********Stock prices of major international drug companies soared Tuesday in anticipation of a new round of takeover activity after SmithKline Beecham PLC said it was discussing a possible merger with American Home Products Corp. **********The combination, if completed, would create the world's largest pharmaceutical company and underscore the intensifying pressure for economies of scale in the industry. **********In 1996, the two companies sold a combined $14.4 billion of prescription drugs, compared with $13.5 billion for the market leader, Glaxo Wellcome PLC, itself the product of a 1995 acquisition by Glaxo PLC.

Baer, director of the commission's Bureau of Competition, said the new agreement committed Merck and Medco to maintain the safeguards and barred any return to the favorable treatment that the commission said Medco had given to Merck drugs on preferred drug lists called formularies. **********Mr. Baer noted that Merck adopted the earlier safeguards in February 1995 in settling a civil suit brought by the Bacon-Normandi Corporation on behalf of pharmacies that objected to the Merck-Medco merger. The three-year agreement ''was a little bit porous,'' he said. **********Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for Medco, said that only 38 of the 533 brand-name drugs on the preferred list had been made by Merck. Of these, 40 were recommended for substitution as lower priced and as effective or better than other products. He said only four such drugs were made by Merck: Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug; Prinivil and Prinzide for cardiovascular problems, and Timoptic XE for glaucoma. **********The commission's agreement binds Merck to provisions similar to those accepted by Eli Lilly after it bought PCS Health Systems from the McKesson Corporation. The Merck agreement would be for seven years after formal approval by the F.T.C.

''Before, companies that had done business with us for a decade would help us out in times of trouble. But no more.'' **********So the customers of Mr. Kim's clothing factory are breaking the rules of the game by squeezing him and curbing orders. And he reacts by breaking the rules again and laying off one-third of his 130 employees. **********That is the harsh reality of free-market capitalism, and it might be unremarkable in the United States. But this is Asia, where in the past some nations followed a different economic model, emphasizing not markets but rather Government planning and long-term relationships. **********That version of capitalism, particularly the variety developed by Japan and adopted by South Korea, is now widely regarded as a problem rather than a solution. For the present at least, the Asian financial crisis is driving Governments and businesses alike toward a more open, market-oriented, laissez-faire version of capitalism, the kind championed by the United States. **********While many aspects of East Asia's community ethos will remain, Asian officials and scholars suggest that the region's economies may emerge from the financial crisis looking a bit more like the American economy. In other words, they would be more open to imports and foreign investment, less curtailed by strict regulations, less dominated by Government planning and more ruthless about laying off workers. **********''Everybody has been liberating markets to take advantage of globalization and the world economy,'' said Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of a policy research center in Jakarta, Indonesia. ''So we are all moving more to the American model.'' **********Still, as Mr. Wanandi noted, this does not mean that Asian countries will adopt the free model outright. Many Asians are still not on friendly terms with the market forces that over the last few months have demolished their economies, and they worry that an excess of markets will threaten a way of life and community ethos. **********While the changes under way seem breathtaking to a laid-off Korean worker, they still leave the region looking -- to Western eyes -- far more Asian than American. Western commentators have been saying for generations that Asians are becoming ''more like us,'' and while in one sense they were right, that does not mean that convergence lies ahead. **********In any case, the change in the mood in Asia is striking because Japanese-style capitalism was perhaps the most formidable rival to neoclassical free-market capitalism as a model for other countries. Japanese officials vigorously urged other Asian nations to adopt the Japanese approach to capitalism, even sponsoring a 1993 World Bank report that was supposed to give the Japanese methods the seal of legitimacy. The report did not quite do that, but it was not as critical of state intervention as an earlier World Bank report. **********To be sure, Asia as a whole never adopted a single economic model. Hong Kong was traditionally a paragon of laissez-faire capitalism. On the other hand, Japan and South Korea relied on a very similar system of industrial planning, huge inter-linked conglomerates, lifetime jobs in big companies, export assistance and protected domestic industries. **********Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia were somewhere in-between, but all borrowed in part from the Japanese development model. Bureaucrats in all those countries sometimes seemed to think that they were better at allocating capital and goods than markets were. **********''How can you go hunting without a target?'' Naohiro Amaya, the late former top Japanese trade official and leading theorist of the Japanese model, was quoted as saying in 1988. ''When you go hunting, you have to shoot at a target. But your neoclassical school of economics says you can fire in all directions at once, and the 'market' will insure you hit the target. Well, we don't accept that line of reasoning, and our economic model will probably be stronger in the future, and have a greater demonstration effect for developing countries, than either the American model, which has become weak and less relevant, or the Soviet central-command model.'' **********The wheel may turn again, but for now there are no more boasts about the superiority of the Japanese-Korean model. **********''Other Asian markets should take note and move their economies more in the direction of free market logic and away from government and bureaucratic intervention and centralized monopolistic industrial power blocs,'' warned the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's leading newspaper. ''If Asians have been arrogant, soaked in snobbish and boastful attitudes, then now is the time to realize their limitations and show a degree of humility and repentance.'' **********These days, both Japan and Korea are trying to dismantle regulations and bureaucratic controls over the economy. ''Economies are all going the American way, and that's a major trend today,'' Makoto Kuroda, a former top Japanese trade official and managing director of Mitsubishi Corporation, said. **********Some Trends Under Way in Past **********Still, Mr. Kuroda noted that there are countercurrents as well, and in any case the trend away from bureaucratic intervention is not a completely new one. **********In Japan, the Government has been losing its ability to manipulate the economy, and layoffs have become more common in the last few years. Regulation is diminishing, and imports have risen, and those trends have been visible in South Korea and other Asian countries. **********The Asian financial crisis has dramatically accelerated this process. While Asia has had crises in the past, like the oil crisis of 1973-74, that were in some ways more severe than the present one, those were external shocks. In contrast, this crisis seems more of a collapse from within, especially with Japan's long stagnation since 1990, and the problems raise fundamental questions about whether a new strategy is necessary. **********''The model is now clear,'' said Lee Hong Koo, a member of the South Korean National Assembly and a former Prime Minister. ''It's not Japan. It's the West.'' **********''The current crisis has convinced almost all people that that the old style doesn't work,'' Mr. Lee added. ''We will adjust ourselves rapidly to the new requirements, which means we will fashion ourselves more like the West, like the U.S. and European model.'' **********Mr. Lee and others emphasize that they do not see the collapse of their development strategy as a defeat for Asia. On the contrary, they hope that freer markets may give the region a new dynamism. **********''If we faithfully implement the reforms we agreed on with the I.M.F., we will emerge with a stronger economic foundation, and we will be poised to overtake Japan,'' said You Jong Keun, a top economic adviser to President-elect Kim Dae Jung of South Korea. **********Several Changes Are Predicted **********In the real world, a shift to a new model is never quite so clear-cut as it sounds, but in general the changes that diplomats and business executives are talking about are these: ***********Governments may control economies less than before. The Finance Ministry in Korea no longer tells the banks whom to lend to, and the Finance Ministry in Japan has lost its capacity to determine the fate of banks and securities houses. As a result, despite official Japanese assurances that no big bank would be allowed to fail, one did in the fall. ***********Labor markets may become a bit more flexible, and unemployment rates will rise. Lifetime employment and rigid seniority will tend to be less important, and layoffs will increase. This has been happening for years but will accelerate. South Korea's unemployment rate is expected to quadruple this year to 10 percent. ***********Relationships in general may tend to become less important. The huge families of linked companies -- called keiretsu in Japan and chaebol in South Korea, where the ship-building arm buys its cars from the linked auto company and its beer from the linked brewery -- is gradually giving way to a more open system in which business is allocated not by loyalty but by price. Already, business groups in both countries are for the first time allowing affiliates to collapse, and Asia's great home-grown champion of relationship finance, Peregrine Securities in Hong Kong, collapsed this month. ***********Companies may make less effort to build market share and more effort to make money. Japanese banks and South Korean chaebol alike are being ordered to disclose more accurate and useful financial information, and everyone is paying more attention to credit-worthiness. **********Transition Apparent In Seoul Already **********These changes are matters of degree, and even modest change will take time. But in Chung Youn Goo's small clothing factory in Seoul, the transition is already apparent. Mr. Chung has laid off a third of his work force, rather than keep them on in hopes for a rebound, as he would have done in the old days, and he is now scrutinizing data as much as cultivating relationships. **********''Our methods of doing business have changed a lot,'' Mr. Chung said as he sat at a small table near the factory floor. ''We put a lot more emphasis on making sure that we have confidence in the companies we deal with. For companies listed on the stock exchange, for example, we conduct a thorough review of their financial standing, because now even the big companies can go belly up very quickly.'' **********The crisis is so recent that the changes in the way of doing business are tentative, and many still have not fully taken effect. But in South Korea, the chaebol have been forced to accept substantial changes by the markets and by President-elect Kim, who unlike other recent presidents owes the chaebol nothing. **********On Thursday, the chaebol jointly promised to adopt Western accounting standards, to bring outsiders into their boards of directors and to reduce the cross-guarantees that subsidiaries make to honor one another's debts. They also pledged to reduce their debt-equity ratios to bring them closer to Western standards. **********These measures are important because the top 30 chaebol account for nearly two-thirds of South Korea's economic output. That was the result of preferential treatment -- the Government ordered banks to lend to the chaebol, for instance -- and the ratio is expected to drop as South Korea becomes more market-oriented. **********To be sure, while executives find themselves forced to embrace the market, that is not to say they find it a pretty sight. Dong Hwa International, a trading company, did some deals with the United States a few years ago, and its executives were angered when the American company promptly cut costs by dispensing with Dong Hwa and contacting the Korean end company directly. **********That was shrewd but unethical, Dong Hwa executives say. Still, they see such moves as the way of the future. **********''I think the Korean economy will look more like America's, because all parties here are trying to cut costs, cutting out third parties, cutting out middlemen,'' lamented Kim Jin Hyung, an executive of Dong Hwa. **********Resembling America Only a Bit More **********Yet Asia is not suddenly going to look like America. One way of looking at it is that young Japanese, Taiwanese, Koreans, Chinese and Thais already wear Western clothes, eat American hamburgers, watch American movies and listen to American music. Within a few years, they are much more likely also to face the risk of layoffs, and to change jobs with American-style casualness. **********All this will make Asia's labor markets, finance and industry resemble America's a bit more, but  Americans do not become more group-oriented or respectful of their parents when they put on a Sony Walkman. **********Japan is still the country that is most hesitant about rapid change toward a more market-driven system, with Japanese wary of the brutality of market mechanisms. The old system protected a way of life that is often inefficient -- with the tiny rice shops and futon-makers that charge ludicrous prices -- but that is also central to the ethos of Japan. A more efficient, market-driven system may mean better prices and more supermarkets, but the fear is that it will also lead to alienation, crime and an end to the civility that is the most outstanding feature of daily Japanese life. **********The result is a profound ambivalence that has Japan tip-toeing toward a freer market system but still aghast at the layoffs and turbulence that a radical economic restructuring will require. **********''Markets are riddled with defects,'' the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest circulation newspaper in Japan, complained in an editorial. ''Markets widen the rich-poor gap and raise unemployment, putting the nation's entire social fabric at risk.'' **********Yet the newspaper acknowledged, just a bit sadly, that ''the move toward markets has reached the point of no return.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/17/technology/l-pet-sites-to-love-898040.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-17", "snippet": "Steven P Smith letter says Sept 10 article on Web sites for pet owners neglected to mention sites for pet adoption (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pet Sites to Love", "print_headline": "Pet Sites to Love", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I enjoyed ''Every Dog Has Its Data'' (Sept. 10) and ''Helping to Save a Few Good Doggies From Death Row,'' which pointed out how the Internet could make a real ''life or death'' difference for homeless animals. **********There are many Web-based pet adoption centers in the country.

Its tidings: Happy days are here again. **********As of yesterday's close, most broad market measures were either close to their summer highs or at them. The Dow Jones industrial average closed the week at 8,975.46, up 59.99 points for the day and 4.46 percent for the week. That places the Dow only 3.8 percent below its July 17 peak and up 19 percent from its Aug. 31 low. For the year, the Dow is up a respectable 13.49 percent. **********Big-capitalization stocks that make up the Dow average are not the only ones moving up. The Wilshire 5000 index, the best approximation for the entire United States stock market, has shown an even better performance. It has jumped 21 percent from its Oct. 8 low, and is up 12.4 percent for the year. Yesterday, the Wilshire had a value of $11.5 trillion. In about one month, the value of the index has risen more than $2 trillion. **********As of yesterday, the market has gone eight sessions without a down day, its second example of such durability in less than one month. But extended moves like these are unusual: to find a third example of such staying power requires a trip back to 1997. **********What's fueling this move? Traders and strategists point to several disparate factors. **********Most significant, perhaps, is a sea change in monetary policy not just domestically but around the world. Central banks, beginning with the Federal Reserve back in September and extending to Britain, Latin America and parts of Asia, have been reducing interest rates fairly aggressively. According to Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, since the September rate cut by the Fed, 27 central banks have done the same. **********''In the last month and a half, the global policy outlook has improved,'' Mr. Applegate said. ''Then this week we had a slew of data that was stock-market friendly. I think the fear trade is out of the market.'' **********Lower interest rates are almost always a tonic for stock prices largely because they mean reduced borrowing costs -- offering the potential for higher profit margins -- for corporations. So it is not surprising that a cut in the discount rate -- the Fed's rate on loans made to banks -- has historically been followed by an average 12-month increase of 18 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. **********Stocks have been getting an additional lift from a giant increase in the money supply. According to Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., the broadest measure of money supply, known as M-2, which includes currency in circulation, savings accounts and money market mutual funds, has grown by 2.5 percent in the last two months. The annualized rate for the last three months is 9.3 percent, the fastest annual expansion since 1987. ''This tells me that there isn't a credit crunch,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''And all this liquidity sloshing around has got to go somewhere.'' **********An increase in the money supply comes basically from the Fed's providing reserves to the banking system, which banks  use to lend. ''New lending and investing power is created as money turnover speeds,'' said Robert H. Parks, an economist and investment consultant in Scarborough, N.Y. ''It brings increased spending power that can go into stocks.'' **********Another supply of money coming into stocks is from investors selling Treasury holdings in recent days. When Russia effectively defaulted in August, Treasuries became the darling of investors. **********No more. The price of the 30-year bond has tumbled this week. Its yield, which rises as the price falls, ended at 5.38 percent, up from 5.15 percent a week earlier. **********An interesting, if somewhat obscure, reason for the advance in equities may be the decline in stock volatility recently. Volatility -- basically the range from high to low in stocks during the trading day -- peaked on Oct. 15. Mr. Applegate notes that since 1948, the S.& P. 500 has risen an average 12 percent in the 12-month period after a peak in volatility. **********''As long as the policy outlook continues to look good, then risk aversion should come down, volatility should come down and returns should come up,'' he said. **********The jubliant stock market is, however, choosing to shrug off some troubling indicators. Corporate earnings, for example. While all the third-quarter announcements are not quite in, the period was a disappointment. **********Even though many analysts have focused on the positive announcements, those were a distinct minority. John L. Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said that of 428 companies that have reported third-quarter results, fewer than 36 percent recorded a positive surprise. He defines a positive surprise as a company that reports a result greater than the consensus estimate on Wall Street one month before the quarter ended. **********Neither do stocks seem to care that it is becoming increasingly likely that the Fed's policy-making committee will not cut rates when it meets on Nov. 17. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, said on Thursday that investors and lenders appeared to be less fearful than they had been. If the deep freeze in the credit markets is indeed beginning to thaw, as Mr. Greenspan seems to believe, another quick rate cut becomes less likely. **********Some investors are calling this the John Glenn rally. After all, since Mr. Glenn blasted off from Cape Canaveral, the market has rallied nearly 10 percent. As long as he has been in orbit, so has the stock market. **********Mr. Glenn returns to earth today.

Prosecutors are scrambling to line up other last-minute witnesses, including the singer Paul Simon, who contributed more than $100,000 to Mr. Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice. **********But the case has gripped this country both because it has offered a window into Mr. Boesak's indulgent living and because President Nelson Mandela has several times swooped in to help him, in ways some critics find deeply objectionable. **********When Mr. Boesak returned from a year in California to face charges last year, Mr. Mandela sent his Justice Minister to greet him at the airport, and in recent weeks Mr. Mandela has openly raised funds for his defense and derided the quality of the prosecution's case, triggering outrage in legal circles. He later apologized for those remarks. **********In his heyday, Mr. Boesak was a clergyman in the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement, defying the authorities and landing more than once in solitary confinement. He was a founder of the United Democratic Front, the political group aligned with the outlawed African National Congress and a man with a certain gift for rallying a crowd. **********''The time has come,'' he told the crowds when the United Democratic Front was officially launched in 1983, ''for white people in this country to realize that their destiny is inextricably bound with our destiny and that they shall never be free until we are free.'' **********But in the years that followed, prosecutors say, Mr. Boesak began using the funds that poured in from foreign donors to support his Foundation for Peace and Justice for his own needs -- sports cars, an expensive home and, after his divorce, the debts of his new, young wife. **********At one point, auditors testified, more money was spent on first-class travel for Mr. Boesak and his family than for any other project the foundation was involved in. **********The accusations of misappropriation of funds surfaced in 1994, when lawyers for DanChurch Aid, a Danish charity, said that money it had sent to help victims of apartheid had been used to pay for Mr. Boesak's house. But it took more than two years before the case wound its way through various bureaucracies and formal charges were made. **********Mr. Boesak faces 32 counts of fraud and theft involving nearly $1.5 million, $195,000 of which he is accused of taking for himself. Much of the money had been donated by Scandinavian charities, but some was donated by Mr. Simon after his Graceland tour of South Africa and some was from the charitable arm of Coca-Cola. The prosecution says Mr. Boesak deliberately raised money from Coca-Cola saying it was for a poverty project, when he had every intention of using the money to invest in a hotel. **********Even after Mr. Boesak's return to South Africa, the case was delayed for more than a year as he battled to have the country's Legal Aid system pay for his legal bills. Eventually, an anonymous donor coughed up more than $150,000 for his defense. **********When Mr. Boesak ran out of funds last month, he appealed directly to Mr. Mandela, who then publicly solicited more money for him. Within 24 hours another anonymous donor gave another $150,000. **********On most days, Mr. Boesak has come to court accompanied by his wife. He has shown little emotion during the proceedings. Some witnesses have been former board members of Mr. Boesak's foundation who described being kept in the dark about almost all of the foundation's financial transactions. Some had even resigned because of the lack of accounting procedures. **********But some witnesses have clearly been reluctant to speak against a man they admire. During Thursday's testimony, the prosecutor battled with an auditor who had trouble remembering much of anything, including which years he audited the foundation's books. Finally, the prosecutor made him read the notes from the margins of his work sheets. **********''A good system of internal checks does not exist,'' the notes said. **********Most days, a small group of Mr. Boesak's supporters sit in the back of the room. But Mr. Boesak says he feels abandoned by almost everyone  but Mr. Mandela. **********At times, he says he has regretted ''ever leading one single march.'' He says the charges are not about fraud or theft but about politics and people getting revenge for the success he had. **********He says that administering the accounts of the foundation was not his work and that he paid little attention to it. ''My job was to work for the downfall of apartheid,'' Mr. Boesak said, brushing aside the notion that perhaps he should have been more aware. ''I should like to think that that was a job not badly done.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/15/business/saudi-prince-buys-stake-in-teledesic.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-04-15", "snippet": "Prince Walid bin Talal, Saudi Arabian billionaire, invests $200 million to acquire 13.7 percent stake in Teledesic LLC (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saudi Prince Buys Stake in Teledesic", "print_headline": "Saudi Prince Buys Stake in Teledesic", "body_text": " **********Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi Arabian billionaire, has invested $200 million to acquire a 13.7 percent stake of Teledesic L.L.C., extending his recent investments in technology, a spokesman for the prince said today. **********Teledesic plans to set up a $9 billion network of 288 satellites to provide Internet access, video conferencing and voice communication to companies beginning in 2002.

The first two players, assuming the usual three-legged stance, tied legs together with the rope; then they walked 50 yards to a hula hoop. The first player stepped into the hoop with his free leg, picked it up by hand and passed it over his head. Then both players lifted their common leg, passed the hoop through to the second player's free leg so that he could then pass the hoop over his head and place it on the ground. **********Having completed the drill, the team returned to the starting line, tied on another person and repeated the procedure. The goal was to sequentially tie together all 10 team members, pass the hula hoop and return to the starting line. **********Given the presence of the beer, coordination was not prevalent, and several participants were so drunk with competitive spirit that they failed to notice their bleeding, rope-burned ankles. **********Mr. Byrne writes, ''The new executive awarded first place to my team, for having the intelligence to quit soon into the game.'' **********After surviving hours of round-robin play, Brian Brown of Manhattan and his doubles partner reached  the finals of the hotly contested tennis tournament at their company's annual sales conference. **********Mr. Brown, who no longer works for the company, writes that their opponents in the finals included a man ''who fancied himself a tennis pro and happened to be a director of our publishing firm.'' **********Volleying with gusto and covering the net with tenacity, Mr. Brown and his partner sensed an impending victory, made all the sweeter by the presence of a crowd of their peers. **********The partners were on the verge of serving out the match when one of their more senior colleagues, who had been watching from the sidelines, called time out and walked across the court to the baseline, where Mr. Brown was standing. **********He cupped his hands to Mr. Brown's ear and whispered: ''Are you out of your mind? The purpose of this exercise is not to lose your job.'' **********Mr. Brown discussed this situation with his partner. **********''Now, with our priorities in proper perspective,'' Mr. Brown writes, ''we managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.'' **********Of course, there is always a bright side to losing. **********Jack Economou of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., recalls the Type A lawyer who lost his tennis match to an easygoing stockbroker by a score of 6-1, 6-2, 6-0. **********As they left the court, the Type A told his opponent, ''Could have gone either way.'' **********School Days For Workers **********Students of all ages are heading back to school this month.

Regional Asia funds plummeted 28.51 percent, while Latin America funds fell 19.21 percent. Eastern Europe specialists managed to escape some of the carnage, losing only 17.41 percent, but funds specializing in Russia were hammered. One of the highest fliers in the past, the Lexington Troika Russia fund, plunged a heart-stopping 55.2 percent in the second quarter. **********What makes the scenario even gloomier is that the extent of Asia's problems is only beginning to sink in. Newly released figures show that the region's economic contraction will be far worse than many had expected. Last week, for example, Indonesia announced that its gross domestic product fell an unprecedented 12.23 percent in the first half of this year. **********With no quick fix in sight, Korea and Thailand, whose markets had rallied by more than 50 percent earlier in the year, have fallen back to their previous lows. Investors are worried over the weak yen, which makes Japanese products cheaper and more competitive against those of its severely weakened neighbors and has even raised fears of currency devaluation in China. **********In one of the few positive events, the International Monetary Fund agreed this past week to provide Russia with $12.5 billion in loans to stave off a devaluation of the ruble. But the weak price of oil, a major source of the country's hard-currency income, remains a major problem. **********The aftershocks from Asia are spilling over into Latin America. Even the relatively stable Chilean economy has been hard hit as the price of copper, its biggest export, has hovered around an 11-year low amid slumping demand from Asia. Investors have fled Venezuela, which is dependent on revenue from petroleum, whose price is near its low for the decade. **********Investors should not expect any relief soon, especially in Asia, according to many analysts who follow these markets. **********\"I wouldn't touch Asia with a barge pole,\" said Albert Edwards of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, one of the few strategists who predicted the Asian crisis. He is forecasting substantial declines in earnings throughout the region next year, with contractions of 10 percent in Korea's gross domestic product and 6.5 percent in Malaysia. Economic recovery in Asia will not be as rapid as it was in Mexico after the peso was devalued in late 1994, Mr. Edwards warned. **********One reason, he said, is the huge amount of private-sector debt relative to the size of many Asian economies. In Malaysia, he said, such debt constitutes 170 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 125 percent for the United States and only 30 percent in Brazil. **********At HSBC Securities in London, Gordon Muir-Carby, who follows Europe's emerging markets, said he expected a difficult third quarter. Mr. Muir-Carby cited a flight to quality as a reason for the dismal performance of emerging-markets funds, as investors opted for safety and relatively easy profits in the blue-chip stocks of Europe's markets, which are booming in line with the approach of monetary union in January and improving economies. **********Of course, some investors who are not risk averse will want to keep an eye out for emerging-market possibilities. But they will have to look carefully at where portfolio managers have placed their bets. Mr. Muir-Carby thinks that by the end of this year, Poland, Hungary, Israel and possibly Egypt will provide opportunities. **********\"They will be providing some good earnings visibility and earnings momentum, and they are going to appear very cheap,\" he said. **********Fund managers with pure plays in the thriving economies of the so-called Club Med countries \u2014 Portugal, Turkey and Greece \u2014 have managed to withstand much of the malaise. The Portugal Fund, run by BEA Associates, slipped only 1.20 percent in the second quarter and is ahead by a hefty 30.93 percent this year, according to Lipper. Morgan Stanley Asset Management's Turkish Investment Fund leaped 20.23 percent in the second quarter after losing nearly 9 percent in the first. **********A 14.4 percent stake in Portugal also kept the Dresdner RCM Emerging Markets fund in the top quartile of diversified emerging-markets funds for the quarter \u2014 despite its 16.3 percent loss. **********\"The Portuguese market was up 40 percent this year and every stock has at least doubled,\" said Paul Cox, the fund's co-manager. The fund also benefited from a 3.5 percent stake in Greece, described by Mr. Cox as a \"massive Euro-convergence play\" that has attracted investors as the government lowers interest rates in preparation for joining monetary union in 2000. **********Another possibility might be Latin American funds. \"Once the storm clears, people will look for quality and see that Latin America is better than before,\" said Donald Hoskins, who runs the Excelsior Latin America fund for U.S. Trust Co. of New York. While he noted that commodity-related industries such as oil and copper have been hurt by falling demand from Asia, he cited solid companies that are unaffected by Asia's problems. The classic plays are those such as Telebras, Brazil's telephone company, which is to be broken up into 12 smaller companies this month. **********\"Brazil would use more and more phones if they could get them,\" said Mr. Hoskins. \"That's internal to Brazil.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/22/business/phone-carrier-fraud-brings-big-us-fine.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1998-04-22", "snippet": "Federal Communications Commission essentially shuts down small long-distance operator called Fletcher Companies and fines it $5.7 million for illegal practice of slamming--communications industry jargon for switching customer's long-distance provi...", "word_count": 329, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phone-Carrier Fraud Brings Big U.S. Fine", "print_headline": "Phone-Carrier Fraud Brings Big U.S. Fine", "body_text": " **********Taking its strongest action yet against the illegal practice of telephone slamming, the Federal Communications Commission essentially shut down a small long-distance operator called the Fletcher Companies yesterday and fined it $5.7 million. **********That was by far the largest fine the commission had levied for slamming, communications industry jargon for switching a customer's long-distance provider without explicit permission.

Ian Paisley issued a rallying cry so ferocious and frightening that you almost expected the 500 people crowded into a grand old hall to grab weapons and rush out to war -- not to their polling stations. **********''Ulster is in jeopardy!'' Mr. Paisley thundered to the delight of an audience that erupted into a frenzy of foot-stomping and whistling. ''A crisis has come upon us! No matter what comes, we will never bow at the knee to a Dublin Government! We will not give our heritage to anyone! What we have we hold! This is a life-or-death battle!'' **********More than anyone else, Mr. Paisley embodies the generations of resentments and resistance to compromise that have galvanized the opposing sides as the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland prepare to vote May 22 on an accord intended to halt the violence in the British province. He has become a lightning rod for those who support what he derides as ''the pernicious agreement,'' many of whom view him as a symbol of why peace has eluded Northern Ireland for so long. **********A hefty, white-haired evangelical minister who established the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party 27 years ago, Mr. Paisley takes pride in having devoted his career to making sure that Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland never reach accommodation. His success so far stands as testament to his skill at melding his religious roots with his political ambition in a conflict where both are inextricably linked. **********With his dramatic, confrontational manner, Mr. Paisley has catapulted himself to being a top vote-getter in the European Parliament, where he has served for two decades and a figure -- like it or not -- with whom politicians must reckon. **********Now, Mr. Paisley, 72, faces the challenge of his life: To try to destroy the settlement by persuading, if not goading, his fellow Protestants into voting against it. (Polls show that while Protestants are divided, most Catholics favor the agreement.) For Mr. Paisley, who has been dismissed as a relic many times over the years -- only to rise up once again -- the outcome might finally demonstrate whether his time has come or gone. **********In contrast to the agreement's supporters, who have been slow to campaign, Mr. Paisley has taken his microphone, loudspeaker and beefy body guard and energetically traveled throughout the lush green towns of this province, arousing a ''No!'' fervor that seems far more heartfelt than the emotions of those who favor the agreement. **********But his sharp edge may carry a cost. Polls conducted for the British Government have found that Mr. Paisley's unbending and blustery style puts off some Protestants. As much as he excites, the fear may also be that he could incite young Protestants to join paramilitary groups. **********Allowing his deputies to explain to audiences their grievances over the fine print, Mr. Paisley prefers broad-brush condemnation. ''If you got the birth certificate of the fellows who drew this up,'' Mr. Paisley said as he waved a copy of the agreement, ''you'd find under the father: the Devil!'' **********Mr. Paisley seems a throwback to the Protestant reformers of the 16th century (except for his ubiquitous cellular telephone), a contrast to the coolly confident, baby boom politicians who are pitching the agreement, like British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He once confronted Pope John Paul II, shouting, ''I renounce you as the anti-Christ.'' **********Unwittingly, perhaps, Mr. Paisley's appearance last week at the Apprentice Boys Hall in this walled city near the tip of this island served as a reminder that the Irish religious wars have persisted for centuries. The Apprentice Boys are remembered here for their defiance in 1689, when they slammed the wall gates in the face of an advancing Catholic army. While the city -- a flashpoint of turbulence in recent years -- is populated mostly by Catholics, Mr. Paisley had no difficulty attracting a loyalist crowd that responded most heartily when he ridiculed President Clinton. **********''We were going to have the President of the United States,'' Mr. Paisley, his voice booming, said of the President's scuttled plan to visit Ulster to campaign for the referendum. ''When I heard he was coming I said, 'Lock up all of the women!' '' **********That was only the warm-up to Mr. Paisley's gleeful tirade about their meeting when Mr. Clinton visited Northern Ireland in 1995. Mr. Paisley said he refused to wait for the President in the same line ''breathing the putrified air'' of Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. **********''So they had to arrange a special room,'' he said. ''The President sat down beside me and he started his usual flatteries. He said, 'You know, Dr. Paisley, I have watched your great career with great interest.'  I said, 'Mr. President, I happen to be exceedingly busy. And I understand you're supposed to be exceedingly busy. So I don't think there will be time for social exchange.' '' **********Then Mr. Paisley recounted his version of how he dressed down Mr. Clinton for meeting with Mr. Adams: ''I said, 'If I came into this room tonight, sir, and said you know those Oklahoma City bombers who did that terrible deed in your country? They are nice men. They are decent men. They were motivated by great principles. And I want to make a request of you, Mr. President: Bring them to the White House! Please shake hands with them! Give them tea and sticky buns!' '' **********His voice seething with disgust, Mr. Paisley growled: ''I said, 'That hand of yours, sir, held the blood-soaked hand of Gerry Adams! And, sir, you know what I feel like doing? Using my foot in your backside.' He just looked at me. Never even tried to reply.'' **********Watching him preach at his immense Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast, which has branches in England, Ireland and Canada, or engaging in retail-style campaigning (when he poses with small children and instructs them to give a thumbs-down for the cameras), it becomes clear that Mr. Paisley cannot be easily compared with any single American political figure. **********He has aroused passions from the pulpit, and built a career marked by demonstrations and jail time for taking part in demonstrations. He has marketed himself into something of an industry; tapes of his sermons are catalogued by his recording studio and available by mail. He has offered no middle ground, either attracting people or repelling them. And he has often been accused of whipping up dangerous, bigoted notions. **********During an interview at the Crumpet restaurant in the town of Limavady east of here, Mr. Paisley treated himself to a heaping helping of sausages and chips bathed in vinegar. Invoking two of the most conservative, and long lasting, Senators in the United States -- Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Jesse Helms of North Carolina -- he allowed how he is not about to fade. **********''I admire Strom Thurmond, being elected at his age,'' he said of the 95-year-old Senator. ''I admire Jesse Helms because they've done everything to remove him -- they couldn't. There's some people who think Ian Paisley will be removed. It's wishful thinking.'' **********Even if the referendum passes, if it lacks a majority of Protestant votes Mr. Paisley said he would consider that a victory -- and one that would give him public support to fight its implementation. He offered this message to Americans who think the peace agreement is a fine idea: ''I wonder what they would say if people of New Mexico were told that Mexico was to take them over?'' **********Then he stepped outside to the main street in Limavady and, undeterred by a drizzle, implored a gathering: ''Get your vote in early -- before it's stolen from you! Spend the whole of the 22nd of May to cajoling, wheedling, dragging, luring people into the booths to vote no!'' **********He then put down his microphone and led a hardy rendition of ''God Save the Queen.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/30/business/worldbusiness/IHT-seoul-turns-up-heat-on-labor-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Don Kirk", "pub_date": "1998-05-30", "snippet": "In a sharp escalation of South Korea's labor conflict, the government said Friday that it would round up and prosecute 143 union leaders for this week's nationwide general strike, while the unions retaliated by announcing fresh strikes in less tha...", "word_count": 3587, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Turns Up Heat on Labor Leaders", "print_headline": "Seoul Turns Up Heat on Labor Leaders", "body_text": " **********In a sharp escalation of South Korea's labor conflict, the government said Friday that it would round up and prosecute 143 union leaders for this week's nationwide general strike, while the unions retaliated by announcing fresh strikes in less than two weeks. **********\"We will have a long battle and strike this summer,\" said Chun Chang Soo, vice president of the Ulsan Council of the Korean Metal Workers' Federation, part of the militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the umbrella group for about 600,000 workers in South Korea. **********\"There will be violence again on the streets of Ulsan,\" Mr. Chun warned.

Nevertheless, a look at some of the outstanding features of European checking accounts today provides a clue to the potential competitive advantages of tomorrow. **********Some generalities apply across the major European markets: No minimum deposit is required to open an account, and there are per-transaction and/or periodic charges for checking and overdraft privileges. Debit cards are more widely used than credit cards, which are considered a perquisite of the well-to-do and carry high fees. **********In Britain, holders of current accounts, as checking accounts are known, can benefit from overdraft privileges, but the interest rates charged for such \"unarranged borrowing\" are among Europe's highest: 30 percent a year is not uncommon. Some banks charge a daily fee of about \u00a33 ($5) and a monthly fee and overdraft interest. **********France is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not pay interest on checking accounts. It is also one of the few in which the use of checks continues to be free of charge and widespread: The Economic Monetary Institute estimates that individuals in France write an average of 120 checks a year, and 50 percent of checks are for amounts less than 300 francs ($50) **********The downside is that if you write a check in France without sufficient funds in your account, the bank can close your account immediately and blacklist you (bancaire interdit) with all French banks. But overdraft privileges are widely available. **********In Germany, the check has never acquired the same importance as in most other Western countries. Consumers favor debit cards, with the Eurocheque card being the most widely distributed. **********ADV, a German consumer association, estimates that 500,000 Germans do not currently have bank accounts because banks consider them uncreditworthy. **********In Italy, where 700 banks vie for retail business, people generally open accounts with local branches because it is not always possible to make transactions at branches other than your own.

To put his finger on the vibrant pulse of modern China, his aides said, Mr. Clinton will spend two days and three nights here talking to regular people. **********Driving down the winding avenues of neon that advertise a distinctly commercial sensibility in Shanghai, his motorcade went from the airport to Shanghai's thriving waterfront, the visual centerpiece of any tour of this mega-city of 14 million. **********A meeting this morning with entreprenuers, community leaders and homeowners in Shanghai was meant to accent the dynamic, fast-growing economic side of China, though it veered off into other topics from the law to religion. President Clinton assembled seven ''agents of change'' for a roundtable discussion at the Shanghai Library. **********''Everyone understands there is a new China that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The purpose here is to help me and my wife and the American people understand the changes that are going on in modern China and the challenges that are out there and what all of your are doing in your lives to deal with those changes.'' **********The group included a law professor, a consumer advocate, a physicist, an economist and a bishop who spent years in prison. Unlike two earlier addresses by President Clinton in China, this event was not carried live on Chinese television. **********The bishop, Jin Luxian, who is attached to a Chinese Catholic church that is independent of the Vatican, appeared to surprise the President with the declaration that he did not think ''belief in religion'' was ''restricted in any way'' in China. **********Bishop Jin also said his church cooperated with the Government. ''Why should church believers do something against our Government?'' he asked. ''Here we adopted the policy of dialogue instead of contending with each other.'' **********Mr. Clinton, who gave lengthy responses to many of the questions, had no reply to Bishop Jin. **********Zhu Lanye, deputy dean of the international department at the East China University of Politics and Law, told the President that the state of the legal profession in China remained primitive but had improved. Mrs. Zhu, who is in her 40's, said China needed to train thousands more lawyers and persuade people to seek legal remedies to their grievances with the Government or in the private economy. **********Wang Xiaoying, 51, a novelist, said she had little trouble getting her novels about family life published. ''Personally, I have signed a contract to publish with three publishing houses,'' she said. ''The problem is not getting novels published but coming up with good ideas each day.'' **********Mrs. Wang asked the President whether literature played an important role in American life, and in his. **********''Very much,'' the President replied, ''and I think not only for enjoyment, but also for enlightenment. We have many books of literature, all kinds of prose and poetry published in America every year, and it is heavily taught in our schools and, at least in our case, widely discussed in our home with our daughter.'' **********To address ordinary Chinese, President Clinton was also the host on a live radio call-in program. **********As he stepped out of his limousine at the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel late Monday, on a busy street lined with crowds of people craning their necks for a glimpse, Mr. Clinton waved to acknowledge the cheer. **********Then he went inside for the evening, passing up the chance to peek at Shanghai's boisterous night life at any of the bars and supper clubs that self-consciously fashion themselves after the styles set in the 1920's and 30's, when Shanghai was the most cosmopolitan city in Asia. **********On Mr. Clinton's daytime itinerary are three landmarks that have opened in just the last two years: a stock exchange that is a leader technologically, a world-class museum with inventive display techniques and China's most modern library. **********Mr. Clinton's aides have portrayed his itinerary as one that traces China's history. In Xian, the first stop, one sees relics of ancient China; in Beijing, the largest icons of Communist China are on view; Shanghai is clearly the most forward-looking city in the country. Of course, that neat description does not account for Guilin, the pleasure spot, or Hong Kong, which both lie ahead. **********''In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China,'' said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. ''The changes that are taking place in China are reflected in the very dynamic growth, economically, and the changes taking place in South China.'' **********To Shanghai residents, actually, the rate of economic growth is palpably slowing. The real estate boom of the mid-1990's has now created a bubble of supply that seems poised to burst but has not done so yet. **********In comparison with much of the rest of Asia, however, Shanghai looks healthy. Round-the-clock construction continues on skyscrapers throughout the city, if on fewer than before. The unemployment rate is rising steadily, as state-owned factories downsize, yet average family income is still climbing marginally. **********There are relatively few formal events planned during Mr. Clinton's stay here, and officials doing advance work say that offers the Clinton family the flexibility for shopping and walks, or quiet time away from their 1,000-member entourage. **********Tuesday's itinerary includes only three events, leaving almost the entire afternoon free for something unscripted. Wednesday's plans are almost as relaxed. On Monday, after speaking at Beijing University, the Clintons took it easy. They stayed in, at Diaoyutai Guest House, playing cards and board games, Mr. McCurry said. **********Hillary Rodham Clinton also has a handful of nonofficial visits planned in Shanghai. To combine her interest in health care and children's welfare, she is to visit the Shanghai Children's Medical Center, a new hospital built by Project Hope, an American-based foundation, and Shanghai's Second Medical University. It is the first hospital in China devoted to treating children, and it was created by nongovernmental entities. **********''This was not in any five-year plan,'' said William B. Walsh, president and chief executive of Project Hope, which has been active in China since 1983, training and advising medical workers in public health. ''It reflects the kind of volunteerism that is starting to grow in China today.'' **********It has also helped, Mr. Walsh said, that two of Shanghai's former leaders who welcomed Project Hope here were later promoted to the nation's top posts: President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. **********Mrs. Clinton also plans to visit a women's education and training center and the Shanghai No. 3 Girls' School. On Wednesday she will visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue, originally built for Jews who lived in Shanghai before the Communist-led army arrived in 1949. **********Mrs. Clinton also joined her husband at the roundtable discussion today at the Shanghai Library, entitled ''Shaping China for the 21st Century,'' which highlighted the way an information-driven age will affect all countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/world/amnesty-given-mandela-aides-is-struck-down.html": {"writer_name": "Suzanne Daley", "pub_date": "1998-05-09", "snippet": "South African court strikes down blanket amnesties Truth and Reconciliation Commission granted to 37 top officials of Pres Nelson Mandela's African National Congress; amnesties were far broader than others issued by commission; ruling raises possi...", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amnesty Given Mandela Aides Is Struck Down", "print_headline": "Amnesty Given Mandela Aides Is Struck Down", "body_text": " **********A South African court today struck down the blanket amnesties granted to top officials of President Nelson Mandela's governing party by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating abuses committed in the apartheid era. **********The amnesties were far broader than others the commission had issued, giving immunity from civil and criminal prosecution to 37 officials of the African National Congress, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, without ever finding out specifically what each had done. **********The ruling raises the possibility that the officials, including five Cabinet ministers, will have to testify about their role in events ranging from terrorist bombings to the torture and killing of suspected spies in A.N.C. guerrilla camps. **********The commission had itself sought the ruling after its amnesty decision, issued in December by an independent committee within the panel, brought widespread protests; political opponents said it was an example of favoritism that undermined the commission's mandate. The ruling is not expected to be appealed. **********The commission was created as a way to put South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials. But it has repeatedly been accused of bias, particularly by whites who say it has vilified former apartheid-era officials and brushed over atrocities committed by others. **********In his ruling, Judge Johan Conradie put aside the amnesties on the ground that the commission had failed to follow proper procedures, including satisfying itself that a ''full disclosure of all relevant facts had been made.'' **********After the hearing, the chairman of the commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, applauded the court's decision, which sends the 37 applications back to the commission's amnesty committee for reconsideration. The committee, though part of the commission, operates independently and cannot be overruled by the Archbishop. **********''I must emphasize that the fault does not lie with the applicants,'' Archbishop Tutu said. ''It lies with the committee for having dealt with the applications in a particular way.'' **********The African National Congress issued a statement saying the party remained convinced that all 37 officials would eventually qualify for amnesty. ''The A.N.C. reaffirms its support for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission process, and its commitment to equality before the law,'' the statement said. **********But the ruling is a political bonanza for opposition parties, particularly the largely white-supported National Party, which has had to endure months of gruesome testimony from its members and can now look forward to watching A.N.C. leaders do the same. **********The National Party had also gone to court to try to overturn the amnesties, scoring a political coup by moving faster than the Truth Commission to file its papers. **********But at the Cape Town hearing today, the party joined the Truth Commission in its application so the case would be resolved faster. Afterward the party leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, quickly claimed victory. **********The decision to grant the 37 amnesties was unique from the outset and appeared to be a blatant violation of the guidelines set out in the legislation that created the commission. The law demands that the applicant must describe the specific acts, and if they include killing, torture, abduction or severe ill-treatment, there must also be a public hearing. **********In the case of the 37 A.N.C. applicants, however, the amnesty committee accepted broad statements from the applicants that they simply took responsibility for all actions of the group's operatives without finding out who did what. **********The applicants were never asked for detailed explanations of the human rights violations they took part in, nor were they asked to appear in public where victims and their families could ask questions. **********This was in sharp contrast to all other applicants, who have often had to sit for days facing harsh questioning before hostile audiences. **********In addition, the commission veered from its usual format by failing to explain its reasoning behind the decision to grant the amnesties. All the committee's previous rulings had been accompanied by arguments. But in these case, only a one-paragraph statement was issued. **********The commission, charged with investigating the past, suggesting reparations and issuing amnesties, is supposed to finish its work by the end of July. But officials have already said they do not expect to be able to finish dealing with amnesty applications by then. The commission has received 7,000 applications, about half of which have been processed. **********Today's ruling is not the first time that the commission has had to backtrack after being taken to court. Last year Archbishop Tutu and the commission's deputy, Alex Boraine, were forced to apologize for remarks they made about the former President F. W. de Klerk. Both officials said they believed that Mr. de Klerk was lying when he said he did not know anything about atrocities committed by South African security forces while he was President. The National Party charged the two men with failing to do their job properly. In exchange for the apologies, the National Party dropped the suit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/business/worldbusiness/IHT-european-central-bank-bristles-at-bonns-demand-for.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1998-11-04", "snippet": "The European Central Bank on Tuesday criticized mounting German political pressure to cut interest rates and fired back at Bonn with warnings not to neglect economic restructuring or fiscal discipline..Wim Duisenberg, president of the central bank...", "word_count": 4114, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "European Central Bank Bristles At Bonn's Demand for Lower Rates", "print_headline": "European Central Bank Bristles At Bonn's Demand for Lower Rates", "body_text": " **********The European Central Bank on Tuesday criticized mounting German political pressure to cut interest rates and fired back at Bonn with warnings not to neglect economic restructuring or fiscal discipline. **********Wim Duisenberg, president of the central bank, pledged to ignore demands by the new German government to loosen credit policy as a way to spawn new jobs and increase economic growth.

Ignored Report of Payments To Chinese for Satellite Contracts", "body_text": " **********Central Intelligence Agency officers in China told headquarters in March 1996 that a consultant who worked for American aerospace companies had made payments to Chinese officials in hopes of getting lucrative contracts, American intelligence officials say. **********The allegation, made in a secret cable, should have set off alarm bells. American law bars companies or individuals from paying bribes overseas to secure contracts, and the C.I.A. has agreed to share information about potential criminal activity with the Justice Department. **********But for reasons that remain unclear, the cable languished in C.I.A. files for more than two years, the officials said. It was unearthed this year only after Congressional committees began examining whether the Clinton Administration had compromised national security in its zeal to promote high technology exports to China, the officials said. **********The consultant is Bansang W. Lee, a Chinese-American who worked for Hughes Space and Communications and for Loral Space and Communications. **********It is not clear whether the cable specifies on whose behalf Mr. Lee would have been making any payments to Chinese officials, or what kind of officials these were. Nor is it clear whose money the C.I.A. believed it was, or how much money may have been involved. **********Administration officials say the Justice Department is re-examining Mr. Lee's activities. His lawyer, Brian O'Neill, said his client ''has never made any unlawful or improper payments of any kind to any Chinese official.'' **********Spokesmen for Hughes and Loral deny any wrongdoing but declined to discuss Mr. Lee's activities. **********A C.I.A. official said the failure to pass the cable on to the Justice Department had been an oversight that was now being reviewed by the agency's inspector general. But it marks the second time this year that agency officials have acknowledged that they failed to disseminate potentially significant information about questionable dealings involving China and American satellite manufacturers. **********The incident also illustrates the pressures that confront American manufacturers as they compete with European companies for a share of a Chinese market in which individual satellite sales can be worth as much as $1 billion. **********Mr. Lee was born and reared in China but educated in the United States, earning a doctorate from Princeton University in electrical engineering. Industry executives say he was a crucial intermediary between American companies and Chinese aerospace officials who on one hand were buying Western satellites and on the other hand marketing their country's ability to launch those satellites with China's rockets. **********State Department documents and interviews with industry executives suggest that Mr. Lee appears to have had a hand in both endeavors. During his years working for Hughes, the company sold hundreds of millions of dollars in satellites and telecommunications equipment to Chinese concerns, and Loral made its first satellite sale to China after it hired Mr. Lee. **********When he was working at Loral, Mr. Lee suggested that the company help Chinese rocket scientists understand the causes of a failed satellite launch in 1996, according to State Department documents. Loral sent technicians to China, and their dealings with Chinese scientists, carried out without United States Government approval, are now the focus of a criminal investigation and Congressional inquiries. **********A Federal grand jury is examining whether Loral, in 1996, and Hughes, in an earlier accident investigation, illegally shared American expertise with China, helping it improve the reliability of their launchings of satellites and ballistic missiles. The companies deny any wrongdoing. **********That inquiry had its roots nearly a decade ago when American satellite manufacturers sought to do more business with China after the Bush Administration approved the first launchings of American satellites on Chinese rockets. **********Hughes was the first American satellite maker to establish a foothold in Beijing, and it opened a new office for Asian deals in Tokyo. **********The company hired Mr. Lee as a Hong Kong-based consultant in 1989, and by the early 1990's, former executives said, Hughes was seeking closer ties to the powerful China Aerospace Corporation, which sells missiles, launches rockets and makes communications satellites. **********Mr. Lee was an ideal go-between. He had a close working relationship with Liu Jiyuan, the chairman of China Aerospace, a satellite industry executive said. **********Mr. Lee moved to Beijing in 1992 and the next year became a full-time Hughes employee, satellite executives said. One executive said the company was so pleased with the business that Mr. Lee had generated as a consultant that it failed to conduct a thorough background investigation before hiring him. **********One year later, Mr. Lee's Chinese business dealings came under scrutiny within Hughes after company employees in Bejing raised questions about some of his private business deals, said a former Hughes executive, who declined to be identified but read from notes he kept of the inquiry into Mr. Lee's activities. **********One of Mr. Lee's separate business deals with a China Aerospace subsidiary entitled him to payments of about $1 million for every Hughes satellite launched on a Chinese rocket, the former Hughes executive and a government investigator said. **********Mr. Lee told Hughes officials that no payments had ever been made, that he had disclosed the general outlines of the deal to the company previously and that the agreement was no longer active, former Hughes executives said. But some Hughes officials called for his immediate dismissal, the former executives said. **********A spokeswoman for Hughes, Helen Sanders, would not discuss Mr. Lee's resignation, saying it was the subject of a confidential agreement. She said Mr. Lee had stopped working for the company in February 1995. **********A few weeks later, Loral, which was trying to break into the Chinese market, hired Mr. Lee, aerospace executives said. Thomas B. Ross, Loral's vice president for government relations, said the company was not aware of any ''allegations at the time'' it hired Mr. Lee and knows of ''no allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Lee during the period he has served as a consultant to Loral.'' **********A former Loral executive said Loral's chief of security had been concerned about Mr. Lee's close ties to Chinese officials. But other satellite executives said Loral had been pleased with Mr. Lee's work, especially his instrumental role in getting Loral to sell its first satellite to China, Chinasat 8. **********Mr. Lee's activities in China appear to have attracted little attention in Washington, except for the neglected 1996 C.I.A. cable. Intelligence officials said the cable mentioned both Hughes and Loral, but further details could not be learned. **********The issue was dormant until 1998, when it was disclosed that Loral and Hughes were under investigation for possible illegal transfers of rocket expertise to China. Congress began its own inquiries, and a House select committee asked the C.I.A. for information about Mr. Lee, bringing the 1996 cable to light. **********About the same time, inquiries from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence led to the discovery that a C.I.A. scientist, Ronald Pandolfi, had learned about Hughes's sharing of expertise with the Chinese in 1995. Mr. Pandolfi wrote a draft intelligence estimate report warning about the military implications in April 1996, about a month after the cable arrived. The C.I.A. decided not to distribute the classified report to select Government officials, as is routinely done with intelligence estimates, saying it was insufficiently rigorous. **********Both the cable and Mr. Pandolfi's report were written at a time when President Clinton was moving to ease restrictions on satellite deals and had shifted primary oversight of sales from the State Department to the Commerce Department. **********In recent reports the Pentagon largely embraced Mr. Pandolfi's conclusions, saying Hughes had provided valuable technological insights to the Chinese in 1995. **********And last week, the State Department's intelligence arm asserted that China had significantly improved its ability to launch rockets reliably as a result of the help from Hughes, lessons inherently applicable to China's missile program, an Administration official said. **********The Pentagon and State Department have raised similar concerns about the help that Loral gave the Chinese in 1996 as it investigated another failed launch. **********The outside review of that accident was organized by Mr. Liu, the China Aerospace chairman and associate of Mr. Lee. In February 1996, before the outside committee was formed, Mr. Lee asked the Chinese to include a Loral representative as part of the investigation, according to a State Department cable recounting what Mr. Lee told an American diplomat at the United States Embassy in Beijing. **********Several weeks later, when Mr. Liu specifically sought a top Loral executive to head the outside review, Mr. Lee relayed the Chinese request to the Loral executive, according to Loral documents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/17/business/executive-changes-891410.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********BANKBOSTON CORP. named Kevin Bryant European general manager. **********FORD MOTOR CO., Dearborn, Mich., said its vice chairman, Edward Hagenlocker, had decided to retire, less than one week after the world's second-largest auto maker named William Clay Ford Jr. chairman. **********MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC., Bethesda, Md., said Michael A.

Since 1972, that brand had been handled primarily by an in-house creative team. **********The Swiss-made Concord watches, priced at $2,000 to $15,000 each, compete against the likes of Baume & Mercier, Cartier and Rolex.

The choice of Arnell Group as the Concord agency, to be formally announced today, is an example of how marketers of premium-priced products are stepping up efforts to peddle their wares to consumers. **********''There's an opportunity in the luxury segment and the watch category in general,'' said Scott Woodward, senior vice president for global marketing and chief marketing officer at Movado Group in Lyndhurst, N.J., ''a huge opportunity to expand what we were doing with Concord.'' Mr. Woodward, who also has an office in New York, joined the company in early September after working for a year at Calvin Klein Inc. as vice president for marketing. **********When asked whether the recent gyrations of the global equity markets would adversely affect the demand for higher-priced watches, Mr. Woodward replied: ''In the luxury category, you do have to look at what's going on externally, such as the shift from the flashy 80's to the conservative 90's. We want to explore what a timepiece means to, and does for, an individual both rationally and emotionally.'' **********''Watch advertising is pretty much standard across the board, very product focused and very rational,'' Mr. Woodward said. ''We're looking at something above and beyond traditional advertising, an integrated marketing program that is more emotional.'' **********Peter Arnell, chairman at Arnell Group, said he thought that concerns about the direction of the economy might even stimulate demand for jewelry and other luxury products that many consumers consider long-term investments. His agency has gained experience in the luxury market by working on such pricey brands as Bergdorf Goodman, Chanel, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Loewe. **********''The real opportunity is to bring a new cachet, a new emotion to a category where there hasn't been very much,'' said Mr. Arnell, who described himself as ''an avid watch collector for the last 10 years.'' **********Most watch pitches, he added, take predictable approaches like ''up-close still life, sports and dancers flying in the air to symbolize performance and movement.'' **********''There's a chance to get people to look at watches differently,'' Mr. Arnell said, ''as I've done with Samsung, the boy with the chest.'' His reference was to the Arnell Group's print and outdoor campaign for Samsung appliances, which features the striking image of a fit, bare-chested young man toting a microwave oven under his muscular arm. **********Mr. Woodward said: ''For Samsung, Peter took what was traditionally a very dry category and did something interesting. And he knows how to integrate a message across every level in a creative way. You walk into Kmart to buy a Samsung microwave and the ad is on the box.'' **********Arnell Group was chosen for Concord after a review conducted by AAR North America in New York. **********''AAR identified a host of agencies, large and small,'' Mr. Woodward said. ''We looked closely at 10 of them and came to the conclusion that Arnell Group was the appropriate selection.'' He declined to identify the contenders, saying Movado had met only with Arnell Group and none of the other agencies. **********Mr. Woodward and Mr. Arnell have worked together before, when Mr. Woodward was a top advertising executive at Ray-Ban, a unit of Bausch & Lomb.

''It was a senior management decision.'' The first Concord campaign from Arnell Group is due next spring. **********Movado Group reported net sales for the fiscal year that ended last Jan. 31 at a record $237 million, up 10.2 percent from $215.1 million in the previous fiscal year. The company's annual report described the Concord brand, along with Movado, as ''standout performers'' that ''generated strong sales growth in both our North American and international markets.'' **********Concord will be one of only two Movado Group watch brands handled by an outside agency.

Most of G.M.'s 22 other assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs, speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where workers walked out this evening. **********With some parts factories also likely to close, G.M. could be forced to temporarily lay off up to 200,000 more workers. **********The workers struck over G.M. efforts to move production tasks to other factories, both inside and outside the country where costs are lower, a move they regard as a threat to job security. Hundreds of strikers shouting ''U.A.W.!'' and toting placards identifying their union locals mobbed the parts factory's gates. They were joined by workers from the metal-stamping factory. **********Scattered among the picketers were members of the United Automobile Workers from across Michigan and even Ohio and Illinois who had come to show their anger at G.M., which has contended with steadily worsening labor relations in trying to make its factories run as efficiently as those of its rivals. **********''We're going to fight, and we're going to keep fighting,'' Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, said this evening. **********Diane Young, a parts worker for 22 years who went on strike tonight, said the action was a regrettable necessity. ''It's a frustrating situation for both sides, but it's the only way to have a future,'' she said. **********G.M. said in a terse statement that it was disappointed by the broadening of the strike. ''We have committed, talented people, and we encourage the union to join management leadership at both facilities to urgently reach settlements that help us effectively work with them to improve G.M.'s competitive position in the marketplace,'' the company said. **********The spark plug factory workers have been increasingly alarmed in recent years as G.M. has bought more basic auto parts from outside companies, including some in Mexico, while selling its own factories or cutting back employment. **********The metal-stamping factory workers have been worried that G.M. management is assigning to other G.M. factories considerable work on vehicles not yet in production, possibly signaling their plant's obsolescence. The strikers have also been infuriated by G.M.'s decision to remove, over the Memorial Day weekend, many of the stamping dies needed to produce hoods and other parts for G.M.'s new full-size pickup trucks. The dies are used like enormous molds to press sheet metal into auto parts. **********As in eight other local strikes over the last three years, G.M. executives have vowed to proceed with their longstanding plans to cut costs. But senior U.A.W. officials have increasingly come to see this confrontation as an emotional struggle, perceiving a threat to the union's long-term survival in G.M.'s willingness to remove equipment from plants where workers are about to strike. **********Negotiators stopped talking after the strike was called but planned to resume talks on Friday morning. With the broadening of the strike to a second factory, the overall walkout could last until the end of June. That is when union leaders will face increased pressure to settle so that U.A.W. members can collect full pay during the industry's annual summer vacation in early July. **********National U.A.W. leaders almost never visited the picket lines during the strikes over the last three years. But they have been doing so daily this week. While senior U.A.W. and G.M. officials refrained from criticizing each other in public during the previous strikes, both sides have been doing so this time. **********Even people close to the U.A.W. concede that the metal-stamping workers in Flint have had one of the most generous deals in the auto industry. Its provisions allowed some workers to draw a full day's pay for half a day's work. Workers agreed two years ago to give up many of these provisions in exchange for further G.M. investment in Flint. The union now contends that the investment has not been forthcoming, an accusation G.M. denies. **********The truck parts metal-stamping equipment was transferred by G.M. to a parts factory in Ohio. G.M. has been planning to build the pickups initially in Oshawa, Ontario. **********But Basil E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, warned in a telephone interview this morning that G.M. should not count on Canadian workers' willingness to accept parts produced by equipment taken out of the Flint factory. The Canadian workers were angry that G.M. managers had made such a presumption. **********''We're not noted much for strike breaking,'' Mr. Hargrove said. ''If anybody says they're moving those dies and that's your livelihood, logic no longer plays any part of it, it's emotion.'' **********Mr. Shoemaker said this evening that G.M. had agreed in negotiations to return the dies to Flint at the end of the strike. He also said that he had learned from G.M. that the dies had accidentally been damaged by nonunion workers during their removal from Flint and consequently had not been used. **********G.M. officials said earlier today that the dies had been moved successfully and were producing new parts. The officials declined to comment on Mr. Shoemaker's remarks tonight. **********G.M. executives have said repeatedly this year that to stay more competitive the company must become more efficient, meaning that each worker must produce more cars and components. While Ford and Chrysler now derive most of their automotive sales and profits from pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, with relatively little competition from foreign brands, G.M. still sells mostly cars and faces heavy pressure from imports and from nonunion factories in the United States. **********That pressure has only increased as the dollar's value has soared in global foreign-exchange markets this year, which makes it even cheaper for foreign auto makers to sell their cars in this country with generous discounts. **********G.M.'s stamping operations are particularly inefficient compared with those of rivals. The company gloated last summer that its cost for producing new dies was only twice that of its most efficient competitor -- but used to be eight times higher. **********The stamping factory in Flint is among the least efficient of all and has been under great pressure from G.M. to improve its results or face closing. ''They have 14 stamping facilities, and they probably need 9 or 10,'' said David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan and Company. **********A successful introduction of the new pickup is considered vital to G.M., which earns up to half its worldwide profits just from sales in North America of full-size pickups and the Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe sport utility vehicles, which share the same underbodies. G.M. plans to introduce new versions of the sport utility vehicles a year after the new pickups."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/02/world/two-states-outline-sanctions-on-swiss-banks-in-holocaust-case.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1998-07-02", "snippet": "New York and California outline sanctions against Credit Suisse and UBS after talks collapse over how much money Swiss banks and Swiss Government will return to Holocaust survivors and heirs; Treas Matt Fong, defying State Department, says Califor...", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two States Outline Sanctions on Swiss Banks in Holocaust Case", "print_headline": "Two States Outline Sanctions on Swiss Banks in Holocaust Case", "body_text": " **********New York and California outlined  sanctions yesterday against two Swiss banks, after negotiations collapsed over how much money the banks and Swiss Government will return to Holocaust survivors and heirs. **********Despite State Department objections, Treasurer Matt Fong of California said his state would not do any more business with two banks, Credit Suisse and UBS. **********The New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said they would outline this morning a series of sanctions that would begin taking effect in 45 to 60 days unless a settlement was reached. **********The decisions were made after all sides of the dispute had spent a day before a committee of state and local finance officials who had until now recommended holding off sanctions, because the talks had appeared headed toward a settlement. **********In New York the first step is most likely to be the rejection of bids for overnight deposits of surplus Government money, followed by banning the banks from underwriting Government bonds. Ultimately the state and city pension funds could sell their shares of Swiss companies. The funds are the second and third largest public employees' pension funds in the country, with combined assets of $188 billion. **********The three officials, as well as others from Pennsylvania and Delaware, said at City Hall in Manhattan they would recommend to 800 other state and local finance officials that they begin applying sanctions to prod the Swiss Government into joining new negotiations. **********''My impression is that the sides are not that far apart and that the problem is with the Swiss Government,'' Mr. Hevesi said. **********Credit Suisse and UBS proposed last month to put $600 million in a ''rough justice fund'' to help Holocaust survivors, in addition to paying whatever sums a commission led by Paul A. Volcker determined were due based on bank records. **********The plaintiffs proposed last week to settle for $1.5 billion, provided that the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank joined in the agreement, Mel Weiss, a lawyer from New York who represents the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said outside the closed session. **********The $1.5 billion is far less than lawyers for survivors and heirs, and for charities designated to represent those who died heirless, have been seeking.

It had been long awaited by the Internet community -- which these days means everyone from multinational corporations to sandals-and-socks computer programmers to grandmothers on America Online -- as the Government's first real attempt to specify a system of governance for the informally organized global computer network born in Federal laboratories nearly three decades ago. **********But after a year of intense study, peering into issues of technology, trademark law, international politics and competition, the Government turned to the Internet community and said -- Here, you do it. **********The Government said it had decided to turn the management of Internet domain names -- and thus the management of the Internet itself -- over to an as-yet-unformed private corporation, representing various Internet interests. That organization will be responsible for fixing the escalating problem of assigning Internet domain names -- the chaotic scramble for coveted cyberspace addresses that was the impetus for the review in the first place. **********Domain names and addresses are the computer network equivalent of phone numbers, street addresses and trademarks, all rolled in one. Each of the millions of computers connected to the Internet requires a unique address, which enables electronic mail to get to its intended destination and World Wide Web pages to be found in what is rapidly becoming the world's main library. Each computer's formal address is expressed as a series of numbers, for example, 199.181.172.241. But to make the addresses easier to use, companies and individuals can ask to assign a name to the numbers, like nytimes.com. **********The ''.com'' part of the address is called a top-level domain, and it is roughly the equivalent of a telephone area code. The current top-level domain system -- seven generic top-level domains like .com and .org and .edu, plus a couple of hundred two-letter country codes -- was created when there were just a few hundred computers connected to the Net. Nobody anticipated the phenomenal growth of the Internet as a global network used by millions for electronic commerce, communications and entertainment. Today, the domain set aside for commercial activity -- .com -- is the largest and fastest growing. **********With more than 100,000 new commercial domain-name registrations being added each month, the Internet is headed toward a traffic jam that makes the overcrowding of phone area codes look benign. **********Rather than try to fix the problem  by adding more top-level domains, which it proposed doing in an earlier, much-criticized draft of the report, the Administration called for creation of a private not-for-profit international corporation whose job it would be to find a solution to the domain-name problem. If all went according to plan, the new corporation would assemble an international board of 15 directors from the private sector (the report did not even specify how the board would be chosen, leaving even that matter to the Internet community) and would begin tackling the most fundamental questions about the future of the global network by October. **********People hoping for more immediate action were left unsatisfied. **********''If they were going to do that, they could have done it a year ago,'' said Carl Oppedahl, a patent and trademark lawyer in Colorado, who has been a critic of the current system, which has no formal structure for resolving domain-name trademark disputes. ''I feel badly about the time delay. The Internet has not benefited from having all these months go by.'' **********The Government reserved the right to overrule whatever choices the private sector makes. And, while repeatedly professing its desire to get out of the Internet oversight business, the Government left open the possibility that it might retain that option until well into 2000. **********The Government's proposal was bad news for those looking for relief from domain congestion or seeking  some improvement of the current trademark dispute morass, and for dozens of domain name registry businesses that had hoped to become rich selling names in proposed new domains like .web, .inc, or .sex. **********But the Government's network solution was good news for Network Solutions Inc., the Virginia company that five years ago was awarded an exclusive Government contract to administer the .com, .org and .net domains. When Network Solutions got the contract, there was no fee to register names. Soon after, it got permission to begin charging $50 for each name (recently reduced to $35). **********Network Solutions' contract is supposed to expire on Sept. 30, but the new report opens the possibility that the company will continue to have a monopoly on the lucrative ''.com''  franchise until the new corporation comes up with an alternative -- something that everyone agrees will be no easy task. As a result, Network Solutions' stock soared on Friday, up $6.75, to $39.25. **********Viewed one way, the Administration's decision to not make any decisions was a vote of support for the Internet's old guard, which has long argued that the Internet is capable of regulating itself without government interference. **********''I have to read it as a victory for self-governance, a victory for the Internet and a demonstration that the Government has developed a profound understanding of the way the Internet works,'' said Don Heath, president of the Internet Society, a trade association. **********Viewed another way, the Government looked at all the hulking issues now pressing in on the Internet and punted. Critics say that by essentially freezing the domain-name situation in its current form for an indeterminate time, the problems facing the new board will be even tougher when it convenes. **********Time was rarely a concern as the Internet grew organically from its origins in the 1960's and 1970's. Keeping track of all the new computers on the network, and all of the technical issues of the emerging medium, was largely a volunteer effort. But in the early 1990's, when restrictions against commercial uses of the Internet were relaxed, the environment changed. **********Today, millions of companies are investing billions of dollars in Internet-related ventures. Millions of E-mail messages cross the network every day, and it is rapidly becoming a conduit for much of the world's telephone calls. Universities, grade school students, farmers, scientists, lonely singles, traveling salesmen, busy families, small businesses and giant corporations have come to depend on it. **********Husbands and wives battle over domain names in divorce court, companies pay six-figure amounts for rights to ''business.com'' and ''internet.com'' and million-dollar legal fees are increasingly common in domain-name trademark disputes. **********With such large issues at stake, many people want a more defined structure for the Internet -- not just an ad hoc group of volunteers, albeit very diligent ones, running the show, as is currently the case. **********The domain name issue is just one of many decisions that need to be made quickly. Others include: Who is responsible for making decisions?  What parts of the structure are best left to the marketplace, and what parts are best left to government interests? In the latter case, whose government? Trademark law is based on geography, while the Internet is the antithesis of geography. How to reconcile? **********These are among the questions that the Clinton Administration expects a new, unformed, untested, international corporation of indeterminate composition to answer as quickly as possible. **********''The process is going to have to be accelerated because the demand for domain names is astronomical,'' said Ken Stubbs, chairman of the executive council of CORE, the Council of Registrars, a group of more than 80 companies that handle domain-name registrations for businesses and individuals worldwide -- and that all must funnel registrations to Network Solutions. ''If domain names were ''800'' numbers or cell phone numbers, and someone announced that there would be no more phone numbers issued for 12 to 18 months, there would be concern.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/business/mutual-funds-report-in-search-of-a-foothold-in-rocky-times.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1998-01-11", "snippet": "Mutual fund investors seeking safety sometimes face unexpected risks as managers of conservative-sounding funds maximize holdings in relatively volatile types of securities to boost yields; managers are under pressure because majority of funds hav...", "word_count": 2038, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds Report; In Search Of A Foothold In Rocky Times", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds Report; In Search Of A Foothold In Rocky Times", "body_text": " **********AS stock and bond markets around the world became more volatile last year, mutual fund investors sought safety. But they did not always get it. **********Some of the very mutual fund managers whose conservative-sounding funds were most in demand reached aggressively for yield, pushing their holdings of relatively volatile types of securities to the limit. **********Consider the CGM Fixed Income fund, a long-term bond fund. Most such funds perform well when long-term interest rates fall rapidly. But in spite of a decline in rates in the fourth quarter, the CGM fund lost 5 percent of its value as the price of one security cratered. The only bond funds that did worse were invested in Asian emerging markets. CGM declined to identify the problem holding, but it recently pushed its junk bond allocation to a third of its portfolio, the fund's self-imposed limit. **********Investors should brace for more blowups in bond funds, said Burton J. Greenwald, who provides advice to mutual funds from his firm in Philadelphia. ''I think you may already have some managers who have been tempted to overreach,'' he said. And stock funds may hold some surprises. ''It seems that after three years of such incredible ebullience in the marketplace, some funds might be further out on a limb than investors realize,'' he said. **********If so, it comes at an inopportune time. At the end of last year, investors made a clear shift to more conservative funds. Government bond funds attracted more money than they lost in the fourth quarter -- the first time they had done so in four years. Growth-and-income funds, the most conservative class of general equity funds, took in nearly half of the money coming into American stock funds, the most since 1989. And investors, unnerved by the tumult in Asian and domestic markets, put a bigger portion of their new fund dollars into money market funds. **********But fund managers have a far different view of the world. Even as they have posted solid gains, their frustrations have grown because they have found it more difficult to keep up with low-cost unmanaged portfolios, like those that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. For the fourth year in a row in 1997, the average stock fund failed to beat the index. **********Most bond funds had trouble keeping up with their benchmark, too. As long-term interest rates fell below 6 percent, to their lowest point in two years, the average taxable bond fund produced a total return of 8.85 percent for the year, according to Morningstar Inc., below the 9.6 percent return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate bond index. **********There were a few bright spots. Funds that specialize in financial services, the best-performing sector of the last five years, continued their torrid pace in 1997, gaining 46 percent. And in the final three months of the year, utility funds, one of the worst-performing groups over the last five years, topped the performance lists. **********Still, the majority of funds had disappointing returns when compared with their indexes. Is it any wonder that some of their managers reached for higher returns in some surprising ways? **********Consider the Oppenheimer Global Growth and Income fund. The manager's midyear report practically screamed ''stability,'' stating in all capital letters that the fund is intended for people ''who need to reduce the effect of short-term market fluctuations.'' **********So what were shareholders to think when they opened the most recent report? They found that nearly one-fifth of their assets were invested in some of the most volatile securities around -- zero-coupon Treasury strips, a form of a long-term Treasury bond that reacts sharply to changes in interest rates. By last week, moreover, the portfolio manager, Frank Jennings, had doubled that bet, placing 40 percent of the fund in zero-coupon Treasuries. **********So far, the gambit has worked. Declining long-term rates helped the fund to a gain of 28.3 percent last year, and it has gained more than 20 percent in each of the last three years. Yet that performance only put the fund in the middle of the pack of 3,000 equity funds that are tracked by Morningstar and that have been around for three years or more. **********After Mr. Jennings took over the portfolio in October 1995, the fund started to adopt some riskier strategies, first by investing more in stocks of small companies and in emerging markets, then, in the last half of 1996, by creeping into zero-coupon bonds. **********The fund made a full-fledged bet on the direction of interest rates last fall. As of last week, two-fifths of the fund's $300 million in assets were invested in long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds -- long-term Treasuries that have the interest coupon stripped away, leaving just the principal. **********''They do roughly twice as well as the long bond'' when bond prices rise and interest rates fall, Mr. Jennings said of the zeros. ''They are equivalent to 50-year Treasury bonds.'' **********Of course, their value also falls more sharply and more quickly when interest rates rise. **********A glance back to 1992 and 1994 shows what can happen when rates rise. The average taxable bond fund lost nearly 4 percent in 1994, according to Morningstar, and a few imploded. In 1992, a European currency crisis produced big losses for shareholders in many short-term world bond funds, which aimed to invest in what were then thought to be ''safe'' government securities. The category has since largely disappeared. **********Mr. Jennings bristles at the notion his strategy is speculative. ''I'm sensitive to being portrayed as a guy who's just a gunslinger,'' he said. Zero-coupon Treasuries ''are less risky than most junk bonds and most telephone company bonds. And they are less risky than Microsoft stock or a lot of stuff that is in most stock indexes.'' **********Some fund managers disagree. ''If a manager's philosophy is primarily to add value by trying to time interest rates, that is as dangerous as an equity manager who tries to time the equity market,'' said Kevin McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income funds at Dreyfus. **********The interest-rate bet seems particularly odd for a fund with a growth-and-income name. Indeed, after the fund made its regular report on its holdings last month, Morningstar moved it into the international hybrid category from the growth-and-income stock category because of its big bet on interest rates. Even Mr. Jennings acknowledges that his strategy is a bit controversial, saying ''I've gotten a certain amount of heat on the subject.'' **********STILL, Mr. Jennings points out that only about one-quarter of last year's returns came from his bond positions, and that astute stock picks -- including Nintendo, the electronic game company in Japan, and Dairy Farm International, the supermarket chain listed in Singapore -- accounted for the rest. **********Mr. Jennings said his current strategy assumed that the economy could fall into recession, leading to a bear market in stocks and ''a massive bond market rally.'' **********''I don't think the average investor appreciates that risk,'' he said, referring to recessionary prospects. **********Investors in the CGM Fixed Income fund might not have appreciated the risks they faced, either. The fund, one in a stable overseen by G. Kenneth Heebner, has been the best-performing general bond fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services over the last three and five years -- a fact that CGM has trumpeted in advertisements. **********But the once-steady performer lost 5.1 percent of its value last quarter, even as long-term interest rates fell and the prices of long-term bonds rose. The average long-term bond fund gained 2.8 percent in the same period, according to Morningstar. **********What hurt the CMG Fixed Income portfolio? No one at Capital Growth Management, the Boston company headed by Mr. Heebner, agreed to talk about it. **********The fund's most recent portfolio, dated June 30 in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, showed that at least 35 percent of its $44 million in assets consisted of bonds below investment grade -- that is, high-risk junk bonds. Those bonds pay high interest rates, and their value moves more in sync with stock prices than with long-term bonds. **********A highly concentrated portfolio is characteristic of the way Mr. Heebner runs his funds. It can lead to significant outperformance when events go the fund's way. But it also means that one holding can cause a portfolio to implode. **********A call to CGM's toll-free shareholder information line produced an operator who, while declining to give her name, said ''a particular holding'' in the fund's portfolio dragged down the fund's performance last quarter. She said that she could not name the holding, but that ''the portfolio has since been restructured, about three weeks ago.'' **********The bond market is not the only place where portfolio managers have been tempted to stretch for a performance edge. A stock fund that has done so by reaching down into the tiniest of stocks, known as microcaps, and by betting big is Safeco Growth. **********One of the best performers among all diversified American stock funds for the last five years, Safeco Growth gained 50 percent last year, making it fifth best among the diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar. Assets have exploded, with up to $20 million a day coming into the fund, helping it to triple in size over the last year, to $600 million. **********That rapid growth has led the fund to assume increasingly large positions in its favorite stocks. At the end of June, 27 percent of the fund's assets were in companies in which the fund owned more than 5 percent. Less than two years ago, such investments accounted for less than 5 percent of the fund's portfolio. **********Some of the fund's positions amount to several times the number of shares that normally trade each day. At the end of September, the Safeco fund owned more than 522,000 shares of Lifeline Systems, which markets an electronic system for summoning emergency medical assistance. That stake amounted to more than 9 percent of Lifeline's total shares, near the 10 percent limit for the fund. Other Safeco funds and employee pension plans owned 6 percent more of Lifeline. Given that a mere 13,500 Lifeline shares trade each day, it would take nearly 60 days for all the Safeco-related funds to sell all that Lifeline stock. **********And Lifeline is but one of a dozen companies in which the Safeco Growth fund has stakes of 5 to 10 percent. **********''If I believe in a stock, I think it's in the best interest of shareholders not to worry about how to get out of it,'' said Thomas M. Maguire, the Safeco fund's manager. ''This is a diversified portfolio. When I hit a home run with a stock, I'm going to make 300 or 400 percent. I'm not going to hit home runs every time, but the most I can lose in any one stock is 100 percent. The ones I'm right about will more than make up for the ones I'm wrong on.'' **********So far, at least, they have. But sometimes an entire sector falls so far that few individual securities escape unscathed. **********For an example, just look at the recent activity in the Asian stock and bond markets. When Southeast Asian currencies went into a tailspin last year, so did stocks in most emerging markets, as well as some bonds and notes issued by Asian Government agencies and banks. **********SOME American money market funds held Korean bank debt when those economies began their slump. IBC Financial Data, which tracks money market funds, said the Alliance Money Market Prime portfolio and the Alliance Capital Reserves fund had the biggest exposures last year. **********At the end of May, the most recent data filed with the S.E.C. showed that more than 5 percent of each portfolio was invested in bonds issued by the Industrial Bank of Korea and the Korean Development Bank. A spokesman for Alliance said that those funds no longer held Korean securities, adding that the ones in the portfolio early last year matured at full value in October. **********The Strong Heritage Money fund, one of last year's best performers among money market funds, also held some Korean securities at the end of August, the date of its last  report. A spokeswoman for Strong said that after those securities matured at full value, the fund did not buy any more Korean securities. **********While these money market funds escaped harm this time, other funds could get caught leaning the wrong way, especially if interest rates reverse their downward spiral of recent days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/26/business/patents-commissioner-quits-after-focusing-attention-intellectual-property-making.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1998-10-26", "snippet": "Profile of Bruce A Lehman, who has announced that he will step down as Commissioner of US Patent and Trademark Office; photo (M)", "word_count": 1036, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; The Commissioner quits, after focusing attention on intellectual property and making enemies.", "print_headline": "Patents; The Commissioner quits, after focusing attention on intellectual property and making enemies.", "body_text": " **********BRUCE A. LEHMAN, who announced Friday that he would step down as Commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, is not a man many people feel lukewarm about. His loyalists defend him as a visionary who has served the public admirably. His critics dismiss him as an intemperate despot who does the bidding of big business. **********But defenders and detractors tend to agree on one point: That Mr. Lehman has raised the visibility of intellectual property by transforming what was formerly a bench-warming position into a prominent perch. **********''He has been savvy about making important people understand why patents matter,'' said Robert Merges, professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley. ''He essentially has made Washington understand that patent issues are important to overall economic strategy.'' **********Mr. Lehman, who was appointed in 1993 by President Clinton, said he would resign by the end of the year because he had accomplished his goals as Commissioner. But there has been speculation for nearly a year that Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, who is Mr. Lehman's boss, was pushing him to leave, after Mr. Lehman became embroiled in a bitter feud with his assistant commissioners. **********''Good riddance,'' said Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, which is based in Washington. ''He was terrible on the issue of making patents accessible to everyone on the Internet. And whatever Hollywood or the biotechnology industry wanted, he would do. His responsibility should have been to the public.'' **********Mr. Lehman, whose background was in copyrights rather than patents, fashioned himself an intellectual-property czar. **********And clearly, he would most like to be remembered for his contributions in the copyright arena. He helped, for example, to negotiate the World Intellectual Property Organization copyright agreements, which were recently approved by Congress. **********Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the agreements were Mr. Lehman's main achievements. ''He foresaw the need to adapt copyright law to the needs of the digital age,'' Mr. Hatch said. **********Some others agreed. ''From a software industry perspective, the legacy he leaves goes well into the new millennium,'' said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, a trade association. ''I couldn't overemphasize the importance of that treaty, which he was so instrumental in negotiating.'' **********Mr. Lehman championed a broad array of copyright changes, in what he hoped would be a precedent-setting White Paper on Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure. But most of those proposals have been rejected, according to James Boyle, now a visiting professor at Yale University law school. **********Among the ideas, since abandoned, that were set forth in the 1995 white paper: a proposal that Internet providers be responsible for the copyright violations of subscribers. **********Professor Boyle helped persuade 100 law professors to sign a letter criticizing the white paper. ''You couldn't get 100 law professors to sign a letter agreeing that the sun will rise tomorrow,'' he said. ''But they signed this letter.'' **********Mr. Lehman was instrumental in trying to harmonize American patent laws with those of other countries. He was a driving force behind a 1995 law -- long sought by industry and other countries -- which changed the term of a patent. **********Before the new law, the life of a patent extended 17 years from the date it was issued. Now, a patent lasts for 20 years from the date of the application -- regardless of how quickly or slowly it was granted. **********The purpose of the change was to discourage so-called submarine patents, which popped up after having been submerged at the Patent Office for years or decades, often because of delaying tactics by inventors who wanted to wait for a particular technology to become widespread so as to receive maximum royalties. **********But Mr. Lehman's efforts drew the ire of independent inventors, whose cause was taken up by such unlikely allies as Phyllis Schlafly, the right-wing opponent of abortion rights; Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and sometime Presidential candidate, and Francis Modigliani, a Nobel Prize-winning economist. **********The organized resistance of independent inventors is the main reason that other so-called harmonization legislation that was favored by Mr. Lehman has lingered on Capitol Hill for several years without becoming law. **********As the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate for a Presidential appointment, Mr. Lehman entered his post with the stated goal of transforming the Patent Office into an agency that celebrated diversity. **********Indeed, two of his top officials were black men, Lawrence J. Goffney and Philip G. Hampton. But at some point, Mr. Lehman's relationship with his lieutenants went awry. Last fall, the three met with Secretary Daley in an effort to settle their differences. **********By March of this year, Mr. Goffney and Mr. Lehman had become embroiled in a bitter, public dispute. Mr. Lehman accused Mr. Goffney of incompetence, while Mr. Goffney accused Mr. Lehman of cronyism and racism. Both Mr. Hampton and Mr. Goffney have subsequently left the Patent Office for private business. **********Mr. Lehman's departure means that soon, four of the top five positions in the agency will be vacant. **********Staff members representing Vice President Al Gore have privately sought out potential nominees to succeed Mr. Lehman. An obvious candidate is Q. Todd Dickinson, a Philadelphia patent lawyer who earlier this year was appointed Deputy Commissioner. **********But the real question is not so much who will be on the Clinton Administration's short list but rather will anyone really want the job. **********The new commissioner will have little time to focus on grand policy initiatives. Instead, his time will be consumed by the mundane logistics of moving a 5,500-person agency into new office space and in shoring up the agency's trouble-ridden, billion-dollar effort to update its technological structure. **********And there is no assurance that the new commissioner would have a great deal of time to take care of even this business: if a Republican wins the Presidency in 2000, a Democratic-appointed commissioner would probably be replaced. **********Mr. Lehman ''is a very smart guy, a very aggressive guy, and he couldn't get past some of these issues,''  Professor Merges said. ''It's bound to scare off the next person. **********''In Silicon Valley, there's a term for this,'' he said.

JURAN; The Guru of Doing It Right Still Sees Much Work to Do", "body_text": " **********IT is hard to believe that Joseph M. Juran is 93 years old. **********His hazel eyes still alternately twinkle and pierce, his smile fluctuates between gracious and sardonic, his wit is keen and sharp. And never mind that he has spent two days holding court in a conference room at the Warwick Hotel in New York, patiently doing one-on-ones with reporters wanting to hear his take on whether American industry finally has its problems with quality under control. He looks rested and positively dapper in his dark suit and bow tie, fielding yet another stream of queries. **********But then, novelty tends to perk up anyone. And for Dr. Juran, arguably the world's pre-eminent living expert on quality in products and the organizations that produce them (W. Edwards Deming, after all, died in 1993), sitting still for interviews is novel indeed. Then again, he is writing his memoirs, so maybe this is a dry run for a book tour. **********Whatever his reasons for opening up, when Dr. Juran talks quality, people listen. **********A native of Romania who emigrated to Minneapolis with his family at the age of 8, Dr. Juran graduated from the University of Minnesota with an electrical engineering degree in 1924 and has been stumping the campaign trail for quality ever since. He earned a law degree from Loyola of Chicago in 1936, in case he needed something to fall back on during the Depression, but he never found law as compelling as management. **********Indeed, decades before re-engineering became a management buzzword, Dr. Juran was applying his then-radical concepts of empowered worker teams and continuous quality improvement to reduce defects at Western Electric's Chicago Hawthorne Works. During World War II, he and his techniques helped  cut the time it took to process military supply orders from the front to 36 hours from 99 days. **********His ''Quality Control Handbook,'' published in 1951, and ''Managerial Breakthrough,'' in 1964, have been hailed by management gurus like Peter Drucker as springboards from which American manufacturers could launch their sporadic leaps into quality. In fact, such praise has been heaped on various speeches and white papers and consulting projects that his Juran Foundation has churned out since he founded it in 1979. **********NOT surprisingly, Dr. Juran does not mince words when he talks about how Japanese companies from carmakers to electronics whizzes have cleaned corporate America's clock on quality issues. He refuses to name today's offenders -- ''it would be unethical for me to point to companies that just can't get their quality right,'' he said -- but he readily condemns companies for quality sins of the past. **********''The Japanese started their quality revolution right after World War II, and it took them until 1975 before they caught up with the West in quality,'' he said. ''Our companies didn't start fighting back until 1980, and even then, most of their initiatives failed.'' **********Why the poor record? In Dr. Juran's mind, the buck stops squarely at the top. **********''C.E.O's have always left quality to chance or to committees, never to people high-level enough to make decisions,'' he said. ''So the workers would use statistical tools to quantify costs and defects, and they'd set goals and monitor progress toward them.'' **********Why is that so bad? He explained: ''Say there's always been a chronic scrap problem that could be solved, but that the workers just think is inevitable and gets built into the goal. It's a problem, but it's treated like a fate.'' **********Dr. Juran has no patience with talk about motivating workers to produce higher-quality products. ''Companies like General Motors would post big slogans like 'Do it right the first time' on every plant wall,'' he said.  ''Well, that sounds great on the transmitting end, but considering that operator mistakes and oversights cause maybe 15 percent of quality problems, it's pretty insulting on the receiving end.'' **********BUT he is no cranky pessimist. He reckons that swelling numbers of companies are finally getting it right on quality -- raising service and customer-satisfaction levels as costs, defects and product-development cycles plummet. **********They are the companies that have learned to do triage on their problems with quality. They let line workers deal with the ''trivial many,'' the hundreds of little glitches from a screw that needs oiling to an inefficient mail delivery schedule -- minor quality problems that nonetheless can add up. But these companies do not hesitate to devote plenty of high-level resources to the ''vital few'' -- the materials or procedures or people that cause the most problems. **********Consider the case of the auto company and the leaky cabs. By Mr. Juran's recollection, anyone driving that company's trucks in the rain got wet. But not all the truck cabs leaked in the same places, so the design errors were not easy to ferret out. Rather than let workers keep plugging isolated leaks, the company asked a team to diagram exactly where the leaks were occurring in a host of cabs. They found that three locations accounted for 90 percent of the leaks. **********''They redesigned just those spots,'' Dr. Juran recalled. ''Now, instead of an average of three leaky spots in every cab, they have an average of just one leak in every three cabs.'' **********The solutions are not always so predictable, leading Dr. Juran to  point out another attribute of companies that know how to tackle quality: ''They are prepared to turn over a rock and deal with some pretty strange stuff underneath.'' **********A case in point: A few years ago, another auto maker, realizing that too many of its cars were going out with unbalanced wheels, formed a team to figure out why. The trouble turned out to be not in the wheels but rather in the testing equipment: It gave inconsistent results, and the readouts were too small for plant workers to see without hunkering close. **********So what started as a project to overhaul wheel making turned into a joint project with the supplier of the testing machine to calibrate the equipment better and provide it with a bright digital readout. Once the new gear was in use, ''fewer cars needed servicing because of imbalanced wheels, and as a bonus, the company could actually cut its field service staff,'' Dr. Juran recalled. **********THE ability to dissect a problem into chewable chunks is another characteristic of a quality-savvy company, Dr. Juran said. The example he cites is, of all things, a Hawaiian-themed resort with a troupe of hula dancers who were not dancing up to par. Hotel managers told them to solve their problem or else. So they trained a video camera on themselves and analyzed the tapes, spotting which dancers made which missteps at which points in the show. **********''Some steps every dancer had trouble with, so they changed the choreography,'' Mr. Duran recalled. ''Good dancers that got a few steps wrong got better training. Dancers that made lots of mistakes on lots of steps just got canned.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/02/world/it-s-kenya-s-farmers-vs-wildlife-and-the-animals-are-losing.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1998-08-02", "snippet": "Kenya's wild animals are threatened by country's farmers, who for 20 years have been encroaching on lands that were once wild and who now regard wild animals as pests; the 8 percent of Kenya's land that is set for wild animals cannot accommodate t...", "word_count": 1789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "It's Kenya's Farmers vs. Wildlife, and the Animals Are Losing", "print_headline": "It's Kenya's Farmers vs. Wildlife, and the Animals Are Losing", "body_text": " **********On a clear day, Agnes Patita can see the tourists in vans inching along dirt roads, searching the plains for antelope, zebra, giraffe and, if they are lucky, an elusive pride of lions. **********But the majestic cats the tourists pay to see are dangerous pests to Mrs. Patita.

During the last 20 years, aerial surveys show, Kenya's wildlife has been disappearing steadily as the country's human population expands and farmers encroach on lands that were once wild, biologists say. At the same time, small-scale poaching for meat by Kenya's impoverished rural people has also increased, conservationists say. **********Although Kenya sets aside 8 percent of its land for national parks, the protected areas are not large enough to accommodate the animals' migration. At any given time, most of the animals are not within the parks, and so they trespass on increasingly crowded farmland. **********Since 1977, when hunting was made illegal here, at least 40 percent of the range animals have disappeared from Kenya's savannahs -- a drop of at least 412,000 animals --  and they are continuing to disappear at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent a year, according to an analysis of government surveys. **********For some species -- the Thomson's gazelle, the waterbuck, the greater kudu, the oryx and the elephant -- the declines have been steeper, far above 50 percent. **********Kenya's creeping ecological debacle has set off a strenuous debate among ranchers, scientists, conservationists and small farmers over how to reverse the trend. **********One camp, led by the current director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, David Western, wants to find ways to make wildlife profitable for local people and give them a reason to  protect the animals. **********Another, led by the former head of the wildlife service, Richard Leakey, argues that Kenya should instead fence off wild lands, more strictly enforce anti-poaching laws and, in essence, give up on trying to stop the decline of wildlife elsewhere. **********Ranchers, meanwhile, argue that they have the right to use the wildlife on their lands, so they will have a financial interest in maintaining them. Under current Kenyan law, the state owns all wildlife, and it is illegal to sell or hunt them without a permit. Giving landowners custody would open the door to profitable ventures like sport hunting and exporting animals to zoos and game reserves. **********For Kenya the stakes in the debate are extremely high. The country's beauty and picturesque wildlife are among its few natural resources.  Along with beaches and coral reefs on the coast, the African wildlife attracts tourists who spend about $400 million a year, the largest single earner of foreign exchange. **********But now most of those earnings never find their way into the pockets of small farmers and herders who must put up with the destruction wild animals cause on their lands. **********Conservationists like Mr. Western are encouraging farmers and ranchers to pool their lands, open private game parks and get into the tourist business themselves. These projects are already operating in a half-dozen Kenyan communities, and plans have been drawn up for 30 more. **********''If you want to preserve the wildlife, you have to find a way to make money on it,'' said Nicholas Georgiadis, an ecologist who heads the private Mpala Research Center in Laikipia. ''Can you create a balance where the wildlife creates enough income so that people want to maintain it?'' **********Lots of People, Not Much Farmland **********The projects that have succeeded, like the Il Ngwezi Sanctuary in Samburu district, have done so because a small number of families have shared in the profits and because they have received financial help and training from international conservation organizations. **********In other places, though, the slim revenues from the sanctuaries have been either spread too thinly among the owners of the land or skimmed off by corrupt local officials. Some of the sanctuaries also lack trained managers able to run a successful tourist resort. **********''Patience will run out unless these newly introduced forms of land use can see tangible benefits,'' said Nehemiah K. Rotich, chairman of the East Africa Wildlife Society. ''They would like to see wildlife making money.'' **********But Mr. Leakey argues that such projects will never succeed on a scale large enough to save wildlife. He and other conservationists maintain that it is a pipe dream to think such schemes can reverse the underlying causes of the decline. Not only is there a human population explosion coupled with little arable land, but Kenya also has no comprehensive land-use plan that would zone land for wildlife, agriculture and cattle. **********''We have to deal with the fact that we have islands of wildlife,'' Mr. Leakey said. ''What we need is the political leadership to say we need these parks intact. The antagonism to wildlife can be dealt with as the antagonism to tax collectors is dealt with.'' **********In 1946 when the first park, Nairobi National Park, was established, there were only five million people living in Kenya. **********Now there are 30 million trying to eke out a living on the same land, and only about a fifth of the country receives enough rainfall to raise cash crops. **********In the last 20 years, tens of thousands of people have migrated into lands not suitable for farming. These farmers have plowed under and overgrazed buffer zones around parks and reserves that the animals must use as dispersal areas during wet seasons, wildlife officials say. Wild lands in Kenya have been disappearing at a rate of 2 percent a year, they said. **********Impoverished people, many facing extreme hunger because they are trying to farm in arid regions not suitable for crops, have poached thousands of animals for food. **********While the Government's anti-poaching efforts, begun in the late 1980's, dramatically slowed down the wholesale slaughter of elephants and rhinoceroses in the last eight years, the local police have done little or nothing to stop a burgeoning underground trade in bush-meat, conservationists say. **********''It's totally illegal but everyone's doing it,'' said Rob Barnett, of Traffic, an environmental organization that has just completed a study showing the trade in bush-meat is thriving in Kenya. ''The law-enforcement people aren't enforcing the laws.'' **********Perhaps the most extensive clash between man and beast has taken place in the Taita Hills, a range of mountains sandwiched like a peninsula of humanity between the western and eastern halves of the Tsavo park. **********Competition for land during the last 25 years has forced tens of thousands of Taita people, who in the past lived on the fertile slopes of the mountains, to move down onto the rangelands below, an arid savannah that was carved up into large communal ranches for cattle grazing in the 1960's. These migrants have splintered much of the ranchland into smaller farms, and they have run into constant battles with elephants, lions and buffaloes. **********At the park headquarters near the town of Voi, Crisant Mueme is a ranger whose job is smoothing out the park's ruffled relations with farmers. **********He and his colleagues keep a dog-eared log book that reads like a police blotter in a big city, except the criminals are all animals. One night a lion takes 10 goats. On another an elephant tramples a man coming home from a bar. Nine people are injured chasing buffaloes from their fields. There are pages and pages of entries about zebras, elephants and buffaloes destroying crops. **********In 1997 alone, there were 87 reports of elephants trampling crops and two people were killed by the mammoth animals. Rangers were forced to kill three rogue elephants during the same period. **********''We are trying to educate the community about the importance of wildlife and how we can benefit from it,'' Mr. Mueme said. ''They are listening to us, but it takes time.'' **********One place where animals have wreaked havoc is the Mramba Group Ranch, a 30,000-acre piece of land right on the border of the western half of Tsavo park. **********Last year, two people were trampled to death by elephants in Mramba, Mr. Mueme said. Farmers there report constant problems, mostly lions killing cattle and elephants eating crops. An electric fence has been erected around the parts of the ranch under cultivation. But the animals are already finding ways around it, local officials say. **********Despite these problems, the governors of Mramba ranch have asked permission from the wildlife service to set up a game sanctuary, hoping to cash in on the tourists visiting Tsavo park and a second private sanctuary in Taita run by Hilton Hotels. **********Living With Wildlife: The Practical Value **********''We have lived along with the wildlife but we haven't benefited from it,'' said Richard Mwambili, a member of the governing committee of the ranch. Mr. Mwambili said the ranch does not yet have the resources to build roads and lodges needed to attract tourists. Though 15 camp scouts have been trained by the wildlife service, they remain idle, he said. **********The delay has frustrated many residents. To overtake what the ranch can now make from cattle, Mr. Mwambili said the sanctuary would have to make more than $300,000 a year from tourism, and it will take several years to build up a steady stream of tourists. **********''I'm going to be the manager,'' he said. ''But I'm not managing anything at the moment.'' **********Still, many farmers in Mramba say they are willing to give the sanctuary a chance, despite their long-running war with wildlife. **********Tourism or Farming: That's the Choice **********''The animals are not good and they are not bad,'' Mr. Mwikamba said. ''If the game sanctuary is put up at Mramba some of my own children might be employed there. If the tourists come, the money from tourism might help sending our children to school.'' **********Unfortunately for park officials, only 3 of the 28 community ranches in Taita have accepted the notion of tourism as an alternative to agriculture, wildlife officials say. **********More than half are considering parceling out lands to families for farms, despite the constant threat of  drought there. It is a formula wildlife officials maintain would mean losing more vital dispersal areas and migratory paths for animals. **********In all, 58 percent of the animal population of Tsavo, some 106,600 individuals, vanished between 1973 and 1993, said Mohammed Dhidha, the regional biodiversity coordinator in Tsavo. **********''Nothing short of a land-use policy by the Government will stop this,'' said James Ndungu, a wildlife official in charge of community coordination."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/05/business/worldbusiness/IHT-oecd-talks-urge-state-to-help-business.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1998-02-05", "snippet": "A pathbreaking meeting of government officials and business executives at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agreed Wednesday that government's role should be to create environments in which business can flourish rather than...", "word_count": 2026, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OECD Talks Urge State to Help Business", "print_headline": "OECD Talks Urge State to Help Business", "body_text": " **********A pathbreaking meeting of government officials and business executives at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agreed Wednesday that government's role should be to create environments in which business can flourish rather than to try to tell business what it should do. **********The meeting was the first-ever international gathering of industrial ministers and the first OECD meeting to invite executives to participate and provide their input to the formulation of policy. **********Speaking positively of the result, John Bulloch, a Canadian executive, said, \"At least the politicians are now all singing from the same hymnal.\" **********That was the emphasis put on the result by the meeting's chairman, Margaret Beckett, president of the Board of Trade in Britain. **********Acknowledging that not all 29 organization member countries hold identical views on the role of government in business, Ms. Beckett said: \"There are differing degrees of opinion.

When the country defaulted, they were livid. **********''There should be lunatic asylums for nations as well as individuals,'' one investor wrote in The Morning Post of London, denouncing the defaulting country as ''a nation with whom no contracts can be made.'' **********It all sounds a bit familiar, but the year was 1842 and the developing country was the United States. After defaults by Maryland, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Louisiana, the entire United States was blacklisted and scorned on global markets, with Americans barred from the best London clubs and the Rothschilds warning bitterly that America would be unable to ''borrow a dollar, not a dollar.'' **********Globalization, in other words, may not be quite as fresh as it sometimes seems. Since at least the 13th century, when Florentine merchants lent money to the English to pay for King Edward I's wars, international capital has roamed the world in search of high returns. (The start was inauspicious: England defaulted, causing the collapse of two Florentine banks.) **********What has changed, economists say, is the scale of the capital flows and their ability to capsize small nations -- or even large ones. Many experts say that one factor behind the economic crisis that has devastated Asia and Russia, wobbled South America, and now come knocking on America's own door is the fantastic increase in the pool of capital that sloshes from one country to the next in search of safety and profit. **********The sums are so gargantuan -- far greater than the amounts that governments can wield -- that a growing number of economists are calling for new steps to control these capital flows or at least soften their impact. Some say that the Bretton Woods economic system, which has governed the global economy for half a century, has been eclipsed by these vast pools of capital, and there are calls to design a new ''architecture'' for the global economic order. **********The topic is expected to be widely discussed at next month's special meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrialized countries, summoned by President Clinton to discuss the global crisis. Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has already discussed measures to ease the volatility of capital flows with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and with his British counterpart, Gordon Brown. **********The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, weighed in this week with a denunciation of rigid capital controls but a call to confront the problem by tightening supervision over banks that engage in international finance. All of a sudden, a vigorous debate is under way, and it may shape the global economy for decades to come. **********''We'll have to rethink the system in a big way,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, a prominent scholar of international economics at Columbia University. ''The President has called this conference, and it should be the start of that process.'' **********Professor Bhagwati urged that the new architecture should ''give up the notion that the optimal world is one characterized by free capital flows, by capital account convertability, where you just press a button and take out a billion.'' **********The Clinton Administration has led a global push to free the flow of capital around the world, and any new impediments to capital flows would be an abrupt step back for its campaign. As recently as last March, the International Monetary Fund newsletter carried a front-page headline cheerily declaring capital liberalization to be ''an irreversible trend.'' **********These days, it looks more reversible. Some economists believe that despite a wealth of scholarly research showing the need for caution, the United States pushed too hard for capital liberalization. The result, they say, was that tides of investment flooded into ill-prepared developing countries and created speculative bubbles, and then surged out, leaving behind shattered nations and a global financial crisis. **********''I actually think the I.M.F. was too pushy in going around the accepted wisdom and encouraging countries to liberalize their capital accounts too soon,'' said Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford University and author of a book on capital liberalization. ''And not the least of the reasons behind this was arm-twisting by the United States Treasury, which always wants American banks and Wall Street people to be in there, competing freely.'' **********Still, there is no question that freer capital flows have brought tremendous benefits to the global economy, as well as perils. Some places, like Hong Kong, have opened themselves to capital flows without restriction and are examples of the prosperity that free movements of capital can reap. Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, likens the flows to jet planes, observing that jets bring enormous efficiencies and benefits to the world -- but that the crashes are more spectacular than ever. **********What are these capital flows? **********They are not some sinister force, but simply the result of ordinary people's cash roaming in search of a good return. When an American deposits money at the corner bank, some of that may end up being lent to a Brazilian company, and the same person's pension fund may dabble in the Hong Kong stock market. **********In the United States, trading in foreign securities amounted to 2 percent of gross national product in 1975 and 213 percent last year, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements. **********Paradoxically, historians sometimes attribute the modern boom in international capital, beyond the easy reach of any regulator, to the Communists. In the 1950's, China and Russia kept their dollars out of the United States, for fear Washington would freeze their accounts, and instead deposited the dollars in Europe. **********One result was the ''Eurodollar'' market and a growing investment pool that flitted from country to country and currency to currency in pursuit of higher interest rates. The amount of foreign currency bank deposits around the world reached $1 billion only in 1961 and now is almost $1.5 trillion. **********One problem, though, is that a lot of this is ''hot money,'' or short-term flows that are particularly volatile. **********Even in the 19th century, sailing ships used to carry gold to distant countries in pursuit of higher interest rates. In 1849, England raised its interest rate by 2 percentage points, prompting an early demonstration of the volatility of capital flows: ships that were already at sea, headed for America with their gold, turned around and sailed to England to get the higher rate. **********Most governments imposed capital controls early in this century and then lifted them in the 1970's and 80's, and limitations on changing money came to be seen as quaint. Paradoxically, it is the holdouts with capital controls, like China and India, that have weathered the financial crisis much better than others, because they were not vulnerable to a sudden exodus of capital. **********''I've been told, 'China seems to be coming out of the crisis well because it has capital controls, so what's wrong with reimposing controls?' '' said Linda Tsao Yang, the American envoy to the Asian Development Bank. **********Ms. Yang and other American officials are wary of capital controls, however, particularly the rigid kind imposed by Malaysia that ban most investments from being taken out of the country within the first year. Scholars say that such capital controls offer short-term benefits but tend to discourage investment in the long run and often get mired in corruption and inefficiency. **********''There is a significant risk that over the next three or four quarters short-term results from Malaysia will be seen as beneficial,'' said William R. Cline, the chief economist of the Institute of International Finance in Washington. ''An illusory temporary success could tempt other countries to follow suit.'' **********The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development this week backed the right of countries to adopt emergency capital controls like Malaysia's. Even the Far Eastern Economic Review, a conservative Hong Kong-based magazine owned by Dow Jones & Company, declared its sympathy for capital controls in a recent editorial. **********''As we look to Malaysia's unorthodoxy,'' it said, ''we hold our nose and cross our fingers.'' **********While Western economists are mostly unimpressed by Malaysia's controls, many speak highly of a quasi tax that Chile has imposed on short-term borrowings from abroad. With that measure, which the country is in the process of dismantling, Chile has been able to attract foreign capital, but has been less vulnerable to a sudden exodus. **********The specific proposals that G-7 finance ministers might discuss to deal with capital flows are unclear. But there is vague talk of increasing supervision over borrowing banks and of establishing funds that could be used to insure depositors or counteract speculative attacks. **********''Outright controls on the flow of funds are virtually impossible in this modern, integrated world,'' said Yuji Tsushima, a finance expert in Japan's Parliament. ''But we should have some device through which if the volatility of the market gets too disturbing, it could be mitigated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/26/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/business/market-watch-oh-those-yawning-spreads.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "1998-10-25", "snippet": "Gretchen Morgenson column on impact on bond market over issue of whether Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts will forestall US economic recession and improve credit availability; graph (M)", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oh, Those Yawning Spreads", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Oh, Those Yawning Spreads", "body_text": " **********True or false: The Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate cuts, and those expected forthwith, will forestall an economic recession in the United States and lower the risk that credit will dry up across the economy. **********True, said the stock market as it meandered upward last week. In one of the calm est five-day trading stretches in months, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,452.29, up four-tenths of 1 percent. **********The bond market, however, isn't sure that all is well yet. Smoke signals from much of the non-Treasury bond markets say a recession remains a possibility. Moreover, while it is unclear whether banks have stopped lending to good customers, the bond markets are still gripped by catalepsy. And so a credit crisis might start there. **********Because movements of various fixed-income instruments, like mortgage-backed securities and high-yield bonds, aren't as easily tracked as stocks, what the bond market is saying isn't immediately evident. But one sign of continued fear among these investors is the difference between the yields they demand on junk bonds and those paid by Treasury securities with like maturities. This difference is known as the spread. **********When investors embrace risk, as they did last spring, spreads between Treasury issues and more speculative debt are narrow. As investors rush into riskier bonds, their prices rise and yields decline. When investors shun risk, as they are now, spreads widen. **********Despite the Fed's latest reduction in interest rates, on Oct. 15, spreads remain wide by historical standards. The estimated yield on Salomon Smith Barney's index of high-yield bonds exceeds that on Treasuries by 6.82 percentage points, compared with a 5.3-point spread before the rate cut. **********''This spread is reflecting a great concern that the economic environment is not very healthy and that, if anything, surprises will be on the downside,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer of the BankBoston Corporation. Mr. Riley agrees with the market and expects corporate earnings to be chronically disappointing for six to nine months. **********The hefty spread on junk bonds is also a sign that the huge market for these corporate bonds is still frozen. As a result, the credit squeeze that the Fed fretted about when it lowered rates remains a possibility. **********According to Mr. Riley, credit contractions can happen for two reasons. One is a result of restrictive moves by bank regulators. The other is more emotional, with lenders pulling back from loans more out of fear of default than its reality. ''It's the emotional action we have to worry about now,'' Mr. Riley said. ''As lenders become gun-shy, they can create a credit squeeze even without monetary authorities being a catalyst.'' **********Hence the interest in credit spreads. If they narrow, it will mean that lenders are becoming more optimistic about their customers' prospects. If they stay wide, a credit contraction is likely. **********Both stock and bond investors think the Fed's recent rate cuts, though welcome, are not enough. Indeed, many are hoping for a one-half-point slash in the Federal funds rate at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in November. **********These hopes could be dashed. Late last week, several Fed members started telegraphing that further rate cuts were not necessarily a given. In a speech on Thursday, J. Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said said the risk that the economy's growth rate could accelerate -- a k a inflation -- hadn't vanished. And, he said, the Fed cannot ''be held hostage'' to the markets on interest-rate policy. **********The stock market has shrugged this off.

Mr. Yeltsin, at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy today, said the use of military force against Iraq would lead to a ''big conflagration.'' **********Mr. Yeltsin, here on his first foreign trip since a long convalescence, was more at ease at the Vatican than he had been at the morning news conference, where he appeared tense and confused as he tried to clarify earlier statements about the Iraqi crisis. **********At the public gift-giving ceremony, Mr. Yeltsin presented two volumes of the Pope's poetry translated into Russian in a specially printed edition, together with two gold goblets encrusted with multicolored enamel. The Pope gave Mr. Yeltsin a two-foot-high bronze medallion depicting the Virgin Mary holding the Christ child. **********Joined by his wife and several dozen members of his official delegation for the ceremonial part of his Vatican visit, Mr. Yeltsin beamed when the Pope, greeting his daughter Tatyana, who serves as Mr. Yeltsin's  personal consultant, said to her in Russian, ''molodets,'' a word that means ''good for you.'' **********And to Mrs. Yeltsin, the Pope added, ''I am very happy to see your husband in good form.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/world/unrest-indonesia-generals-role-military-potential-unifier-split-conflicting.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1998-05-15", "snippet": "Key to Indonesia's future lies increasingly in hands of its powerful military, as nation suffers its worst crisis in 30 years, its capital seething with rage and Pres Suharto struggling to keep control; the one institution with an efficient nation...", "word_count": 868, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Role of Military: A Potential Unifier Split by Conflicting Goals", "print_headline": "UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE GENERALS; Role of Military: A Potential Unifier Split by Conflicting Goals", "body_text": " **********As Indonesia suffers its worst crisis in 30 years, its capital seething with rage and its President struggling to keep control, the key to the nation's future lies increasingly in the hands of its powerful military. **********The one institution with an efficient nationwide organization, and the one institution that enjoys broad support among most Indonesians, may ultimately decide whether it is time for President Suharto to heed widespread calls to step aside after 32 years in power. **********A former general himself, Mr. Suharto has worked hard to insure the loyalty of the military, appointing his supporters -- in many cases his personal aides -- to all its top positions. Whatever its internal disputes, the armed forces has been seen as firmly behind the President. **********But it also takes seriously its mission as the nation's unifying force, as well as its constitutionally mandated responsibility to insure national stability. **********''I think the present leadership is very loyal to Suharto and it would only be in extreme circumstances that they would consider taking action against him,'' Harold Crouch, an Australian political scientist who is an expert on the Indonesian military, said earlier this year. **********''But in a sense, we are approaching those extreme circumstances,'' he said. ''Let's say rioting broke out: there would be a point where they would say, 'Something has to be done.' '' **********Now the riots have come, ripping away any hope that Indonesia could weather its political and economic crisis in peace. Since the region's economic downturn hit Indonesia hard at the start of this year, with rising prices, food shortages, unemployment and bankruptcies, the specter of social unrest has kept the nation on edge. **********The current turmoil in Jakarta, and the shooting deaths of several student demonstrators this week, approach the worst-case scenario that political analysts and foreign diplomats had feared. **********And with Mr. Suharto continuing to take an inflexible stance, brushing aside calls for political reform, elements of the military may already be saying something must be done. Indeed, some officers have publicly voiced sympathy with the calls of student demonstrators for reforms. **********This would seem to put them at odds with Mr. Suharto, who made a show of ignoring the nation's economic and political crisis in March by proceeding with a scripted re-anointment to a new six-year term, then packing his new Cabinet with relatives and cronies. **********''There is only one question now: What is the military going to do?'' said Kwik Kian Gie, a leading economist. ''And the next question is, who is the military?'' **********Is it hard-line Suharto loyalists, thought to be represented by the President's son-in-law, General Prabowo, whom he recently named to head the special forces? Or is it pragmatic professionals like Gen. Wiranto, a former aide-de-camp, whom the President recently named to the dual posts of Defense Minister and armed forces chief? **********Will they face the question posed last week by Amien Rais, an outspoken Muslim leader, of whether to ''support the President'' or ''support the nation''? **********The Indonesian armed forces enjoy widespread respect as the agent of liberation a half century ago from Dutch colonialism, and play a constitutionally prescribed political-military role known as ''dwifungsi,'' or dual function. **********From the highest levels of government to the lowest bureaucratic echelons, the military permeates the nation's administrative structure. Seventy-five seats in the 500-member Parliament are reserved for the armed forces. Half of provincial governorships are held by military men. Many Cabinet ministers, senior civil servants, ambassadors and directors of state corporations are soldiers. These civilian duties occupy fully two-thirds of the 300,000-member military. **********''In the last 10 or 15 years, it's been in a major sense the backbone of the Government and ultimately, in a crisis, the army is what will hold the nation together,'' Mr. Crouch said. **********As the crisis here has grown, many Indonesians have become fascinated by the experience of the Philippines a decade ago in which mass demonstrations of ''people power'' stopped the tanks of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and persuaded soldiers to disobey his orders to shoot. **********The dynamics of Indonesia's crisis differ in many ways from those of the Philippines. For one thing, the violence here has already far surpassed that of the Philippines in 1986. But in both cases, the soldiers sent to quell the disturbances share the hardships and the sentiments of many of the demonstrators. **********''These soldiers are the next generation,'' said Ali Sadikin, a political scientist. ''We know they are also suffering.'' **********At a campus rally today, Harinan Siregar, a doctor who took part in student demonstrations a generation ago, said that -- as in the Philippines -- some demonstrators were hoping to win over the soldiers who were guarding them. **********''Some people think that with the support of the military they could topple the Government,'' he said. ''So they try to convince the army to come over to their side.'' **********And in a scene that is as common here as it might be unusual in many another country, the arrival of a contingent of soldiers at the University of Indonesia campus today -- wearing red berets and carrying long riot-control sticks -- was greeted by students with cheers and applause. **********The soldiers responded by waving their sticks in greeting, and soon the young men -- soldiers and students -- were mingling and embracing like friends."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/18/business/2250-layoffs-set-at-chase-or-3-of-staff.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy O'Brien", "pub_date": "1998-03-18", "snippet": "Chase Manhattan Corp to lay off about 2,250 employees, or 3 percent of its work force, as it consolidates administrative and business functions; about half of the layoffs, or 1,125 jobs, will be in New York metropolitan region and New York State; ...", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2,250 Layoffs Set at Chase, Or 3% of Staff", "print_headline": "2,250 Layoffs Set at Chase, Or 3% of Staff", "body_text": " **********The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's largest bank, said yesterday that it planned to lay off about 2,250 employees, or about 3 percent of its work force, as it consolidates administrative and business functions. **********About half of the layoffs, or 1,125 jobs, will be in the New York metropolitan region and New York State. The cuts are part of a plan to eliminate about 4,500 of the bank's 69,033 positions over the next 18 months by laying off workers and by not replacing others who depart. **********When Chase and the Chemical Banking Corporation agreed to merge in 1995, the two banks employed about 75,000 people. The completion of the merger in 1996 brought the elimination of about 12,000 jobs. But the number of employees subsequently grew, in part because of smaller acquisitions Chase pursued, such as last year's purchase of the credit card business of the Bank of New York Corporation. **********Chase employees have been aware for some time that layoffs were on the way and a climate of uncertainty has pervaded the bank -- an uncertainty that will now be prolonged as Chase carries out the layoffs. **********An internal memo circulated to employees in January indicated that layoffs were coming. At the time, Chase said it was freezing hiring in its corporate and business-support units. Chase also said it planned to trim $70 million a year from its budget by declaring a ''moratorium on the use of all management consultants,'' reducing its sponsorship of events and other measures. Chase said yesterday that many of the cuts would affect the company's back-office operations, though it said the rest would be proportionally shared among the bank's other operations. **********''The uncertainty is nothing new,'' said one employee who insisted on anonymity. ''Now we just know what the exact numbers will be.'' **********Chase said it would take an after-tax charge of $320 million against its earnings for the first quarter, related to the layoffs and administrative consolidation. No further layoffs are envisioned for the immediate future, the bank said. **********Chase's president, Thomas Labrecque, said that the broad outlines of the layoffs were decided only this week and that he had consulted Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani about them. Mr. Labrecque said annual savings from the moves would be about $460 million. **********''It's a meaningful chunk of change that will make investors feel better about the company's earnings outlook,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. **********The bank plans to reinvest the savings in highly profitable businesses like cash management, high-yield debt, advising on mergers and acquisitions, stock research and underwriting, originating and servicing mortgages and credit cards. **********Mr. Labrecque said the moves would assure that revenue growth would rise to 10 percent annually in the next two years from current rates of 8 percent. He also said the cutbacks would help achieve a goal of an 18 percent return on equity -- a key measure of profitability. **********''Where we're really looking for the push is not that the expense base will go down, it's that the revenues will rise,'' Mr. Labrecque said. **********As part of the reorganization, Mr. Labrecque also said that Chase would create a unit, Chase Business Services, that would perform functions common to all of the bank's businesses, like marketing, benefits administration and property management. **********Chase also announced that it would raise its quarterly dividend to 72 cents from 62 cents and that it planned a 2-for-1 stock split, pending shareholder approval. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase shares rose $6.4375, to $134.75. **********Despite the reaction of the market, some analysts said that yesterday's announcement failed to allay some of their concerns about Chase, such as its continued exposure to economic uncertainty in Southeast Asia and the soundness of some of the bank's loans. **********''This was a very narrow restructuring announcement and didn't get to some of the more meaningful issues like credit quality,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/business/l-telephone-ethics-a-matter-of-priorities-288624.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-12-06", "snippet": "Ann Farthing reply to Ian Alterman's Nov 18 letter defends practice of lying to phone callers about bosses' availability (S)", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Telephone Ethics: A Matter of Priorities", "print_headline": "Telephone Ethics: A Matter of Priorities", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I was surprised by the suggestion of Ian Alterman that ''many secretaries are discomfited by having to lie'' about their bosses' availability to take telephone calls (Letters, Nov. 18). **********I'm sure that most of the people calling the executive I assist know that at least some of the time he's not really ''in a meeting.''

After the war, the  Austrian authorities refused to allow Jewish families who had fled into exile to retrieve their artworks and take them abroad. **********''It is our will to clear up after 50 years what has not been done before,'' Mrs. Gehrer said. ''We cannot make wrongdoings right, but we can make justice possible.'' **********The Austrian branch of the Rothschilds is among the Jewish families whose extensive art holdings were taken by the Nazis and subsequently held by art museums here, including the Kunsthistorische and the Belvedere.

She praised Mrs. Gehrer for her perseverance. **********''I give her enormous credit,'' the Baroness said. ''She has shown great guts. I don't think it's very popular.'' **********The leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Jorg Haider, said on Wednesday that the Government's effort to return the confiscated art was too great a favor to Jews. **********The move to return the art began  after an uproar last winter over the disputed ownership of two Egon Schiele paintings lent by an Austrian foundation for a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

But executives around the country say recruiting good people has been more difficult in the last year to two years. **********Many blame the industry itself, in part at least, for the crunch. During the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, agencies stopped hiring and laid off the middle managers they now need, said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York. **********''We're now paying the penalty for that,'' he said. ''We sort of lost a whole generation of new people.'' **********Some of those lost workers became freelancers and are now quite happy on their own, thank you, said Anne Melanson, director of human resources at the Bates Worldwide unit of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C., a $6 billion agency based in New York. About 10 percent of the people her agency would like to hire are freelancing, she said. **********As the economy has improved, others have jumped to lucrative jobs at consulting firms and in corporate marketing departments, leaving lagging agency salaries behind, Mr. Drake and others said. **********Camille Weas, human resources manager at Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, an $863 million agency that is majority-owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, said Campbell Mithun stopped shopping for young M.B.A.'s in the late 80's because advertising salaries were no longer competitive. **********New York agencies complain about a shortage of talent, but those in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the Midwest are particularly frantic. **********''There are certain areas that people don't necessarily want to go to,'' explained Judy Wald, chairwoman of Judy Wald Partners, an executive search firm in Manhattan that specializes in advertising positions. **********Campbell Mithun opened a 15-employee satellite office in New York last year for finicky creative types who are hard to lure to Minneapolis, Ms. Weas said. **********In Los Angeles, Brian Morris, president of Dailey & Associates, another unit of Interpublic, said area agencies had found recruiting tough because of ''the riots and earthquakes and floods and everything else.''

Michael Armstrong and John C. Malone have arranged a very modern marriage. In the proposed $31.8 billion merger of the AT&T Corporation, the nation's biggest long-distance phone company, and Tele-Communications Inc., the second-largest cable-television company, theirs will be a partnership of equals pursuing starkly different career goals. **********Mr. Armstrong, AT&T's chief executive since last November, will throw all his energies into integrating AT&T's telephone services with TCI's cable wires in a drive to offer local phone service to consumers. **********Mr. Malone, who built TCI from a scrappy West Coast cable company into an industry behemoth, will hardly be a passive partner in that endeavor. Indeed, he will become one of AT&T's biggest individual shareholders and will sit on its board. **********But he will spend most of his time doing what he enjoys most -- cable deals. By retaining control over Liberty Media, TCI's separately traded programming unit with stakes in such properties as QVC Inc., Home Shopping Network, TV Guide, the Discovery Channel, Encore Media and Liberty Fox Sports, Mr. Malone will in effect have his own sandbox to play in. **********All the while, both men stand to make a lot of money from the deal. Mr. Armstrong could get rich and Mr. Malone a lot richer than his current $2.4 billion net worth. **********At a joint news conference yesterday, the 58-year-old Mr. Malone said he thought his ownership of some 25 million TCI shares was worth about $1.2 billion, though he added that he was so optimistic about the ramifications of the merger that earlier in the day he had bought another $240 million in TCI stock at market prices -- or roughly five million shares. **********The rest of his wealth is mostly tied up in Liberty and a third company, TCI Ventures, that will be folded into Liberty. He will ultimately be able to swap the TCI stock for AT&T shares, tax-free. **********''I don't have John's problem,'' Mr. Armstrong joked yesterday, referring to Mr. Malone's wealth and his seeming uncertainty about its value. **********Perhaps not, but he isn't doing too badly. According to an AT&T proxy filed in March, he received a $14.9 million stock package when he left the Hughes Electronics Corporation to join the phone company. He also got a $1.4 million salary, a comparable bonus and performance-related stock designed to match his salary this year and next. **********If Mr. Armstrong can make this merger work, of course, he is likely to benefit from huge option grants that could push his long-term compensation into the stratosphere. **********Unlike Ted Turner, Time Warner vice chairman, who sold his Turner Broadcasting System to Time Warner and did not retain a separate power base, Mr. Malone will continue to run his own fief at Liberty Media. **********He has always been an avid deal maker, and in overseeing Liberty, which will have relatively little debt, he will have ample opportunity to buy and sell and negotiate. ''He wants to build asset value,'' said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. **********That role should suit Mr. Malone's impatient personality well. Since Liberty is generally a minority investor or partner in cable-programming holdings, he will not be required to get involved in day-to-day operating duties, a task that has never particularly interested him. **********Given the complexity of the deal, however, it is not yet clear just what the final structure of AT&T will be. Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Malone said yesterday that while the first step was for AT&T to acquire TCI, a second step was to spin off AT&T's residential long-distance and cellular businesses together with TCI's cable systems into an AT&T ''tracking stock.'' Tracking stocks represent ownership in certain, specific assets of publicly held companies and rise or fall with the fortunes of those assets. Investors in such stocks have no voting rights, however. **********The advantages of a tracking stock for the issuing company are twofold: It retains full control of the underlying assets, and it is subject to fewer tax consequences. **********Mr. Malone is already taking advantage of the tracking-stock structure to sell back shares of AT&T that TCI received when it sold a stake in Teleport, a company that provides local phone and data services to businesses, thereby pumping up Liberty's cash reserves. TCI will also sell its shares in At Home, an Internet access and information services company that operates over cable networks, to AT&T for cash. Those shares are held by Liberty and TCI Ventures, respectively, both of which are themselves tracking companies of TCI. **********Mr. Malone sees the new Liberty as a sort of GE Capital Corporation, he said yesterday, because it will have the capital to make leasing investments in such technologies as digital cable set-top boxes, which could help AT&T grow. **********But before any of that can happen, Liberty said yesterday that it would merge with TCI Ventures, which has a wide range of holdings in Internet telephone and foreign cable ventures, in a stock deal with Liberty offering 0.52 share for each share of TCI Ventures. **********The merged Liberty-TCI Ventures -- which will retain the Liberty name -- will be an unusual form of tracking stock because AT&T, though it will swap a new class of its shares for the Liberty shares, will not have a direct financial interest in Liberty.

An article on the findings appeared in The New York Times on Sunday. **********Stock analysts sought to remind  investors yesterday that other drugs successful in the laboratory had failed in humans and that the progression of even the most successful biotechnology drug from discovery to market was rarely a straight line. **********Entremed has found that the two substances -- angiostatin and endostatin, which are naturally occurring in humans -- together interfere with the blood supply to tumors, make the tumors shrink and disappear, and prevent their return. The compounds were discovered by Dr. Judah Folkman, a cancer researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. **********The drugs are in a class of molecules known as anti-angiogenesis compounds, a research area that has been pursued by large pharmaceutical and small biotechnology companies for several years. While Entremed is a year away from starting clinical trials in people, some anti-angiogenesis drugs are further along. A related class of drugs, known as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, which disable an enzyme that tumors use to invade surrounding tissues, is also advancing. **********Stocks of many small companies involved with these drugs shared in the euphoria surrounding Entremed, which closed yesterday at $51.81, more than four times its $12.06 closing price on Friday. The most neglected companies of recent months showed the greatest percentage gains. Immunogen closed at $2.31, up 78 cents, or 51 percent; Boston Life Sciences finished at $7.59, up $5.47, or 257 percent; Repligen was at $3, up $1.53, or 104 percent; Sugen closed at $16.44, up $2.81, or 20 percent; Imclone Systemsended trading at $10, up $1.25, or 14 percent, and Magainin was at $8.19, up $2.25, or 38 percent. **********Companies with drugs in the later stages of development got less of a boost. Genentech fell 44 cents, to $68.50, despite having one of the broadest pipelines of cancer drugs, including an anti-angiogenesis compound. Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which is testing a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, closed at $34.38, up $1, while British Biotech, which has a similar drug in clinical trials, closed at $13.50, up $2. **********''The Entremed thing was overdone, but this is going to be an important area,'' said Jim McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter. The biotechnology company with the broadest effort in anti-angiogenesis, he said, is Imclone Systems, a New York company that is pursuing three approaches. **********Mr. McCamant cautioned that animal data give no guarantee of success. ''Immunogen announced superior mouse data back in April 1997,'' he said. ''Genentech announced encouraging data in this area 15 years ago, using tumor necrosis factor in mice. Unfortunately, in large quantities, it proved toxic to humans.'' **********Anti-angiogenesis is by no means the exclusive province of the smaller companies. Entremed is a partner with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the dominant player in cancer chemotherapy drugs, to develop angiostatin, and is seeking a partner for endostatin. Bristol-Myers has its own internal development program in such drugs, as do Zeneca, Takeida and other big pharmaceutical companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/world/gun-battles-in-serbia-raise-fear-of-another-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1998-03-06", "snippet": "Serbian police and paramilitary units unleash helicopter gunships and armored personnel carriers against armed Albanian separatists in Kosovo Province, forcing dozens of Serbian families and Albanian women and children to leave and cordoning off s...", "word_count": 1225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gun Battles in Serbia Raise Fear of 'Another Bosnia'", "print_headline": "Gun Battles in Serbia Raise Fear of 'Another Bosnia'", "body_text": " **********Serbian police and paramilitary units today unleashed helicopter gunships and armored personnel carriers against armed Albanian separatists in Kosovo Province, forcing dozens of Serbian families and Albanian women and children to leave and cordoning off scores of villages to keep outsiders away. **********Twenty Albanians and two Serbian policemen were killed, the Serbian interior ministry said. **********A spokesman for Kosovo's Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said there were houses burning and ''massacres being carried out.'' It was impossible to confirm such accusations because no access was allowed to areas where fighting was going on. **********''Today's attack proves the unprecedented brutality of the Belgrade regime,'' said the spokesman, Mustafa Xhemaje. **********Serbian police officials said they began the attack in the Drenica area, 25 miles west of Pristina, the provincial capital, after Albanian separatists attacked a police station at dawn, wounding two officers. **********People attempting to enter the area were turned away by police officers in flak jackets and armored personnel carriers. Helicopter gunships whirred overhead, and there were reports that detonations could be heard in the hillsides around Prekaz. **********The villages under siege today were the same ones where at least 24 Albanians were reportedly tortured and executed by Serbian police and paramilitary units last weekend, apparently in retaliation for the deaths of four Serbian police officers. **********Many Serbs here say state security forces have been distributing automatic assault rifles to Serbian men in the province, and Western diplomats express fear that the attacks could broaden into the kind of rampages that characterized the behavior of the Serbian forces in Bosnia during the war there. The black-uniformed special paramilitary units from the ministry of interior that are now deployed in Kosovo served in Bosnia. **********The people, too, say they fear something more ominous, and those who can are fleeing on their own, especially the Serbs. They account for less than 10 percent of the two million inhabitants of this once autonomous province, including 25,000 who were resettled here after being expelled from other parts of the former Yugoslavia. **********Life seems particularly bleak for the refugee Serbs. **********In a dank, stuffy gymnasium, Zdravko Olovic sat peeling four potatoes for his dinner tonight. The battles, raging just a few miles from his refugee center and its 400 residents, brought back troubling memories of his life as a Serb in Croatia at the start of the war for independence from Yugoslavia there in 1991. **********''Perhaps, given what has happened in the rest of the former Yugoslavia, it was just a question of time before this occurred in Kosovo,'' he said. **********The Serbs here live in small ghettos and towns where they have little contact with the Albanians. The Albanians, most of them Muslims, boycott all state institutions, often do not speak Serbo-Croatian and view the Serbian police and military as an army of occupation. **********The Albanians in Kosovo have their own parallel government -- which levies taxes -- and shadow institutions including a school system operated from private homes. **********The distance between the two communities is so wide that it is difficult to see how it can be bridged. The Serbian Government seems deaf to pleas that it grant the Albanians the political rights it revoked in 1989 when it abolished Kosovo's status as an autonomous province. **********Today's assault was apparently aimed at wiping out an outlawed guerrilla organization, the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is seeking independence for the province. The attack was viewed as open defiance by the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, to international calls for restraint and dialogue. (Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics left in Yugoslavia.) **********The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, representing the European Union, met in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic today and urged him to negotiate with the Albanian separatists. He also warned President Milosevic that he faces increased international isolation if he continues to use force to smother the unrest, European diplomats said. **********The foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy are to meet Monday in London to discuss Kosovo. **********''The fear among the Serbs is escalating,'' said Bosko Drobnjak, the chief of information for the Serbs in Kosovo. **********''These terrorists used to target state bodies and their representatives, first of all the police. They then started to murder prominent Serbs and ethnic Albanians who remained loyal to the state. Now they are killing ordinary Serb civilians. **********''The state must protect its citizens. It must provide security. If we do not, people will lose confidence.'' **********The Kosovo Liberation Army has promised revenge attacks against Serbian police officers for the recent spate of killings. **********Over the past few weeks, gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army have opened fire at night on apartments where police officers live and on centers for Serbian refugees. Separatists have killed at least 50 people, including many police officers, in the past year. **********Serbs planning to leave the province, especially many of the refugees, said they believed the violence would continue to mount. **********''No one wants to go to Serbia,'' said Tanja Strbac, 24, a Serb who works in the Pristina electric company and who was expelled from Croatia with her family. ''We are not given Serbian citizenship as refugees. We are denied employment in state companies. Only in Kosovo can Serbian refugees find work and equal treatment. The pressure, however, has become too much. It is unbearable. I live in an old hotel with 450 refugees and every few days another room is empty.'' **********Ljubisa Radenkovic, 22, is in the police reserve and works as a waiter in a small restaurant where only Serbs dine. His brother is a police commander who, he says, has been in four armed confrontations with the separatists. **********''There are stories that 500 terrorists have infiltrated from Albania to fight,'' he said. ''My family is from here, but 90 percent of my cousins have left. We have only three or four close relatives still in Kosovo, and most of them want to get out.'' **********Vera Raden, 36, a Serb, said, ''We have seen enough of violence and terror.''

It is time to leave.'' **********--------------------        U.S. Reinstates Sanctions **********WASHINGTON, March 5 (AP) -- The Administration responded today to reports of Serbian massacres of Albanians in Kosovo by reimposing sanctions on Yugoslavia. **********A State Department spokesman, James Foley, denounced ''the excessive use of force'' by Serbian police and announced the reversal of recent decisions to let Yugoslavia open a consulate in the United States, land planes from its national airline here and expand the Yugoslav diplomatic mission to the United Nations. **********The sanctions had been eased after President Slobodan Milosevic supported a moderate new government in the Serbian republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********The State Department says that the Albanians are entitled to greater self-government within Yugoslavia, but that United States policy does not support independence.

Bacon, said today that he knows of no plan for the United States or NATO to send troops to Kosovo. The Administration is ''focusing on diplomacy'' and urging restraint on all sides, he said. **********But Mr. Foley reiterated that violence in the province ''can have an impact beyond Kosovo.''

Sweeney, the American labor leader, seemed almost to be seeking his blessing. A Frenchman tried to get him to criticize the French Government's plan to shorten the workweek. A Canadian sought his approval of bonuses and profit sharing for workers, rather than wage increases. And an American tried to get Mr. Sweeney's consent to the proposition that Mexican wages will rise. **********Like a water buffalo at a gathering of elephants, Mr. Sweeney, the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, was an unusual sight at the annual World Economic Forum, which ended today. This is a gathering of several heads of state and hundreds of top government officials, corporate chiefs, financiers, academics and bankers who network, lobby, make deals and talk over the ills of the global economy. Until recently, union leaders were seldom invited and this time only six were present, the five others from Europe. Mr. Sweeney, who first attended last year, is the only union official ever to come from the United States in the forum's 27 years. **********Like everyone else, he wandered the crowded halls of the conference center, greeting people like Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar Inc., as if that company had never gone through a horrendous, still unresolved union battle. Or he agreed to have a cup of coffee with a chief executive in a hotel coffee shop, a short walk or shuttle bus ride along the snowy main street of Davos. **********''In this atmosphere,'' Mr. Sweeney said, ''you can chat with chief executives and world leaders so easily in ways that I cannot do back home.'' **********His message was short, focused, direct and repeated, like a politician's stump speech. The global economy and free trade are here, a fait accompli, acknowledged by labor, Mr. Sweeney said. Job-shifting across borders to lower-wage labor cannot be entirely stopped. Nor can damage to workers from crises like the current one in Asia. But national labor movements must come together to insist on minimum international labor standards and a seat at the table when the International Monetary Fund negotiates bailout agreements that fall hardest on workers. **********''We will demand coordinated efforts to stimulate growth, to regulate currency and capital speculation, to extend labor and democratic rights as part of the response to the Asian collapse,'' Mr. Sweeney declared. **********He made this case from a podium that he shared with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's President, and George Soros, the financier. The audience of several hundred responded with warm applause to the presentations of Mr. Cardoso and Mr. Soros. Their view generally was that strong economic growth would raise worker incomes. Mr. Sweeney, taking a different tack, drew no applause. ''I got good feedback later,'' he said. ''People here don't want to publicly applaud labor.'' **********Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, made Mr. Sweeney a target in one of his presentations, charging that he was out of date, a throwback to labor movement thinking in the 1930's, including opposition to agreements that promote free trade. ''He just does not get it,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''We are not opposed to trade agreements, but they have to be done properly, and not leave out workers.'' **********Whatever the frictions, the World Economic Forum's organizers say they will add more labor leaders next year. ''I had made an attempt before to invite more labor leaders,'' said Klaus Schwab, the forum's president. ''But unlike business leaders, you did not find many labor leaders who thought globally. And I did not want Davos misused as a forum for national disputes.'' **********Mr. Schwab is also responding to another concern of the business executives and government officials who are the backbone of these annual conferences. A frequently expressed worry at the forum was the potential for strikes, demonstrations and violence, particularly in Indonesia, as workers react to the damage from the Asian crisis. **********''I think everyone is very concerned with the second wave of the Asian crisis,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''The first was financial and the second is going to be social and political.'' **********At a luncheon on Monday given by the labor leaders, the half-dozen executives at Mr. Sweeney's table  sought his sympathy or at least his informal counsel for their labor problems back home. Roger Cukierman, chairman of the Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild Banque, in Paris, asked Mr. Sweeney if he favored the French plan to cut the workweek to 35 hours from 39, with no cut in pay. **********Mr. Sweeney said he did, to Mr. Cukierman's disappointment, but on a softer note, he agreed with the banker that the shorter week would not prompt French employers to hire more workers, which is the goal. Instead, they will probably fill the extra hours on overtime, the two men agreed. **********Predictably, Mexico and the North American Free Trade Agreement  came up. ''What people in Mexico tell us is that as productivity rises, they will pay higher wages,'' said Steven C. Kletjian, chairman of the Unicco Service Company in the United States, which takes over operations that corporations outsource. **********Mr. Kletjian's comment brought a standard Sweeney reaction. ''From the data we have now,'' he said, ''we know that while Nafta created some jobs in the United States, they are mostly low wage. In Mexico, the new jobs are the lowest of the low.'' **********Brian R. D. Smith got the answer he sought. He is chairman of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, a government-owned electric power utility, with 6,000 unionized employees. He is trying to persuade his workers that they should accept profit-sharing and bonuses, rather than fixed wage increases. **********''That is happening more and more,'' Mr. Sweeney said, ''not only profit-sharing but stock distribution.'' **********And Mr. Smith beamed. Will he quote Mr. Sweeney in his continuing  conversations with his workers?

Mr. Clinton listed some of the obstacles and harassment that inspectors faced. But the inspectors said the problems went far beyond the President's statements. **********The scope of Iraq's germ program remains cloaked in mystery, the experts agreed, with indications that Baghdad had backtracked during this round of inspection on even its previous minimal cooperation.  ''Clearly, they weren't going to cooperate and were going out of their way to cause problems,'' one official who returned from Baghdad said. **********Iraq has already confessed to making enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on earth several times over. After the gulf war, Baghdad admitted to having loaded botulinum toxin (which causes muscular paralysis resulting in death) into 16 warheads, anthrax (which causes high fever and is usually fatal within two weeks) into five warheads, and aflotoxin (which causes liver cancer) into four warheads. **********It also acknowledged having filled 157 bombs with the same deadly agents, and having conducted research on tricothecene micotoxins (which cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), wheat cover smut (which ruins food grains), hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (which causes extreme pain and temporary blindness), rotavirus (which causes acute diarrhea that can lead to death) and camel pox (a camel version of small pox). **********But the inspectors now believe that Iraq could well have gone even further, based on discrepancies between what Iraq has declared having imported, consumed and destroyed. Inspectors said that the biological teams were denied at least three key documents, at least one of which was key to reconciling Iraq's reporting record. **********According to two inspectors, the United Nations team asked the Iraqis on the morning of the first day of meetings for a ''log book'' that described purchases and imports for the germ program, which several of them had seen in 1995 but had failed to grasp its significance. Among the log book's entries were imported shipments of the special foods used for growing germs. **********At the first meeting, the Iraqis promised to produce the log book. But each day they offered another excuse. The inspectors said the book was critical to estimating the amount of germ agents that Baghdad could have produced and turned into weapons. **********At first, the Iraqi team said they couldn't find the log book, two inspectors said. Then the Iraqis said that the book should be retrievable, but that they would need the approval of Tarik Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, to release it. On the last day of the meetings, the Iraqis indicated they were still looking for the  book. An inspector said, ''This was less cooperation than we had seen six months ago.'' **********In other cases, the Iraqis refused to provide documents they acknowledged existed. One was a list of imported food to grow germs from the customs department, which was also requested on the meetings' first day. The Iraqis said they couldn't find them, an inspector said. Another missing document was an inventory of germ food that had been stored at Al Hakam, Iraq's major germ production center. **********An inspector said that if Baghdad had used the germ food to grow deadly agents, especially anthrax in either liquid or dry form, the microbes could still be used in weapons. **********On Dec. 4, Diane Seaman, an American inspector, tried to lead a large, experienced biological team into a site inspectors considered routine. While she was permitted to go the building, the Iraqis refused to open the office she sought to enter, telling her that she would have to  ''break down'' the locked doors.. **********''It was a holy day,'' one inspector conceded. ''But there can be no exempt days or the inspection system wouldn't work.'' **********The Iraqis also delayed making available key officials from the biological program.

Olde, the firm's former president and chairman, was fined an additional $1 million by the S.E.C., which accused him of failure to supervise. Stanley A. Snider, Olde's former director of national sales, was ordered to pay $100,000, and Daniel D. Katzman, a former Olde regional manager, was ordered to pay $50,000. They were accused of playing roles  in inducing and causing the violations. **********The case is the first in which the S.E.C. has held a brokerage firm directly liable for its brokers' fraudulent sales practices, said Richard P. Murphy, a senior trial counsel with the commission's Atlanta office. **********In settling the charges, the firm, Mr. Olde, Mr. Snider and Mr. Katzman neither admitted nor denied the charges. Lawyers for the firm, Mr. Olde and Mr. Katzman were said by others at their firms to be unavailable for comment. Mr. Snider's lawyer, Bruce Hiler, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers in Washington, declined to comment. **********Under the settlement, Mr. Snider and Mr. Katzman are barred from association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company for five years. Mr. Olde faces a one-year suspension. **********The brokerage firm was also fined $1.35 million by NASD Regulation Inc., the regulatory arm of the N.A.S.D., which accused it of using and distributing improper advertising. Mr. Olde was fined $500,000 and suspended from the securities industry for 18 months. **********Olde issued a statement saying the settlement built on a series of initiatives it began on its own more than three years ago. Those actions include changes in management, compensation structure, enhanced sales and supervisory systems and expanded broker and supervisory training programs, Randal J. Mudge, Olde's managing director, said in a news release. The company said it planned to employ an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures. **********According to the S.E.C. complaint, brokers routinely used high-pressure sales practices, and earned substantially higher commissions for selling stocks in which Olde made a market. Many of those stocks were speculative and unsuitable for elderly, retired investors, Mr. Murphy said. **********The firm advertised commission-free services to investors, failing to tell them that the firm made money on many of the stocks that brokers were pushing. **********''The firm created a situation that channeled their brokers' efforts to selling a narrow slice of the investment products'' that Olde offered and ''resulted in the brokers' illegal conduct,'' Mr. Murphy said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/21/technology/libraryweb-sites-for-girls-offering-curious-girls-room-for.html": {"writer_name": "Bronwyn Fryer", "pub_date": "1998-05-21", "snippet": "Review of Web sites for preteen-age and teen-age girls, including A Girl's World; photo (S)", "word_count": 549, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIBRARY/WEB SITES FOR GIRLS; Offering Curious Girls Room for Exploration", "print_headline": "LIBRARY/WEB SITES FOR GIRLS; Offering Curious Girls Room for Exploration", "body_text": " **********AS the mother of a 5-year-old girl, I have high hopes that my daughter will achieve Internet literacy. At the same time, I know how tough it can be to find great Web sites where a girl can safely hang out and have fun. Try typing in ''girl'' on a search engine, and you will see what I mean. There is a plethora of Las Vegas-style entertainment, but not much to comfort a parent. **********Fortunately, there are a few wonderful sites that present utterly absorbing, enjoyable and comparatively safe places for preteen-age and teen-age girls. In fact, I'm convinced that, taken together, Web sites like the ones reviewed here -- Girl Tech,  Purple Moon and A Girl's World --  may just be the ''killer app'' for girls. The traffic tells the story: these sassy sites gather 1.5 million to 2 million hits a month, making them as attractive as, say, www.Disney.com. They employ a magic formula, a successful combination of things many young girls love to do in their free time. **********One of these ingredients is the power to create and develop fantasy worlds over which girls can exert a degree of control. When I was a kid, I loved sharing gifts and secrets with my friends. I liked to write long stories and leave them in my best friend's locker. I liked pretending I was someone else. I had penpals in Europe and Africa. On these sites, a girl can do all the things I loved to do. **********Of course, the Internet can be a creepy place for kids. It is too easy for young Web surfers to be caught in a wave of messages from predators who ask them inappropriate questions about their age, their sex and where they live. So as a nervous parent, I am particularly heartened by the safety precautions taken at these sites. A girl can spend hours on the Web without getting into much more trouble than attends a she-hurt-my-feelings spat with an on-line acquaintance she has never met. The sites' Webmasters -- or Webmistresses -- all go beyond posting lengthy warning messages to parents and rules for girls. **********Purple Moon, for instance, monitors all incoming and outgoing messages and requires a parent to register, too, when her or his daughter signs on to the site. A Girl's World tracks messages and E-mail and reports any suspicious messages to the F.B.I. (The site's founder, Karen Willson, says she has seen only four such messages in the site's two-year history.) Girl Tech circumvents any communication hazards by posting all messages in supervised forums. **********The most important contribution these sites make is that they give girls a place to enjoy themselves and one another without being passive consumers. While they are having fun, they are learning to feel they have a place in the world of computer technology.

In the morning she throws off her Malo cashmere-covered hot water bottle, slips on a Lucien Pellat-Finet cashmere tank with a pair of Fake London cashmere bondage pants, eases her feet into her Manolo Blahnik cashmere stilettos and kisses the baby \u2014 wrapped in cashmere swaddling \u2014 good-bye. **********Cashmere has emerged as the quintessential fiber of the late 1990s, embodying all the relevant fashion values of now. It resonates luxury, sensuality, elitism, heritage and a heady dose of mystique (just how many wearers realize cashmere comes from combing herds of hairy goats roaming Inner Mongolia?). **********\"It combines the notion of comfort and exclusivity,\" says the French cashmere designer Lucien Pellat-Finet, \"And, most importantly, it is an exclusivity that is worn for oneself, rather than, say, a fur coat, which is about exclusivity worn for others.\" **********Right now the consumer longing for cashmere is on a high. In Britain, cashmere brand Brora announced its September sales 100 percent up on the previous year, while in Paris this week Pellat-Finet launches his childrenswear with a spring/summer collection of mini tops and cardigans destined for precious offspring aged two to 14. He is set to add homewear in January with a new line of throws, blankets, cushions and kimono-shaped dressing gowns \u2014 all in cashmere. **********Still in Paris, Frederique Hood is also working exclusively in cashmere, designing what she describes as \"body accessories\" that include ankle and wrist warmers, shoulder warmers (a narrow shawl attached to the upper arms) and a cool abbreviated cape in magenta four-ply cashmere knit. **********And in Milan, the knitwear brand hLam is exploring cashmere's spring/summer potential with their newest yarn, a single-ply cashmere that has been knitted off-gauge to create what they call \"cashmere air.\" **********\"It's a super, super light knit and it feels almost like lingerie,\" explains the designer Gunn Johannson. \"We've used it for tiny pieces like T-shirts and camisoles.\" **********A few years back, cashmere was confined to golf clubs and London's genteel shopping arcades; now it's featured on every runway in town. So what is behind the substantial increase in fashion profile? For a start, designers have realized its potential is a whole lot more exciting than sugary twin-sets. **********\"Cashmere is so resilient, so tough, you can do things with it you couldn't possibly do to wool,\" says Desiree Mejer, of Fake London, who is at the forefront of injecting sex appeal into what was once a prudish yarn. \"You can press it, boil it, knot it and it always comes back.\" **********For spring/summer '99, Mejer has button-fly jeans and bondage pants made from woven cashmere, while for sweaters she has indeed slashed, boiled, safety-pinned, printed and tie-dyed cashmere to get a raw and urban look. **********\"Cashmere has always been so stuffy,\" says Mejer. **********\"I wanted to do something more subversive. Although it is a symbol of quality and it is classic and conservative, it is also a question of not being intimidated by all that, but instead repossessing cashmere and doing something different.\" **********And certainly cashmere's fashion moment is being driven by consumer demand for something different. **********About six years ago, Victoria Stapleton started her mail-order cashmere business Brora in the United Kingdom with the intention, she says, of \"supplying your bog-standard cashmere jumper at the same quality as shops, but at cheaper prices because of lesser overheads.\" **********- **********SO she started with the standard issue of \"V-neck navy blue gents jumper,\" but soon realized that, in fact, what people were craving was, as she puts it: \"cashmere in groovy styles. Cashmere has always been so badly designed, so traditional and so basic, I realized just by taking it that one step further and giving it a bit of an edge, it highlighted us from other people.\" **********Brora styles tend to stay the safe side of fashionable, so although Stapleton has kept a core of basic sweaters, she also offers cashmere hooded tops, slouchy pants, cropped and skinny-rib styles and for next spring/summer she is experimenting with a lacy filigree cashmere with lurex sparkly detail. In six years, Brora sales have grown tenfold, she has opened a retail store on King's Road in London and has just launched a capsule baby Brora cashmere collection. **********The fact that cashmere as a raw material is currently widely available also explains its high fashion profile and accounts for its recent presence on the high street. **********\"Normally cashmere is in short supply and is an expensive fiber,\" says Brian Walbank, sales and marketing director for Todd & Duncan, a Scottish cashmere spinning mill. \"But at the moment, due to an accumulation of raw material over a couple of seasons, it is in plentiful supply and every man and his dog wants cashmere selling on his counter.\" **********Dubbed the democratization of cashmere, it means it is currently being sold at a whole range of price levels and differing qualities with cashmere sweaters available at the French supermarket Monoprix for 490 francs ($88) or Britain's Marks & Spencer from \u00a390 ($150). **********\"Cashmere is a word generically known as a luxury fiber,\" says Walbank. \"The big problem is how to differentiate between all the different qualities out there.\" **********Walbank predicts the current cycle for cashmere at all price levels will last at most a further two years, before returning to being an exclusively prestige fiber. And finally in the rise of cashmere, there is the power of air-conditioning. Thanks to an increasingly temperature-controlled environment, designers and mills alike are betting the future of cashmere is no longer confined to the traditional autumn/winter season, but is reaching out into spring/summer territory. **********- **********TODD & Duncan are working on a fine-weight single ply summer yarn suited to T-shirts and tiny cardigans, while Lucien Pellat-Finet, who has a line of two-ply sweaters and tops insists, \"You go somewhere like the States in summer and you go to the supermarket and there is air-conditioning on full blast, or out to a restaurant at night and there's air-conditioning on full blast. If you wore just a T-shirt, you would die.\" **********Unless that is, it happens to be a cashmere T-shirt, preferably two ply. **********ALICIA DRAKE is a fashion and style writer based in Paris."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/02/news/american-topics-not-all-hippie-communes-have-succumbed-to-reality.html": {"writer_name": "Brian Knowlton", "pub_date": "1998-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 505, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Topics : Not All Hippie Communes Have Succumbed to Reality", "print_headline": "American Topics : Not All Hippie Communes Have Succumbed to Reality", "body_text": " **********In the spring of 1976, a group of long-haired young dreamers bought 304 acres of rolling woodlands near the small town of Harrodsburg, Indiana, and moved into canvas teepees. They slept on dirt floors, cooked over campfires, raised chickens and goats and tended an organic garden. Their dream: to build a Utopian community. **********\"In those days you were young and it was all an adventure,\" recalled Sara Steffey, 47, one of the original members of May Creek Farm. \"We were all really happy. It was like retiring in your 20s.\" **********Such dreams, of course, tend to encounter harsh reality \u2014 cold winters, leaky roofs, the need, like it or not, for money. And so hundreds of the communes like May Creek Farm that sprang up in the '60s and '70s disbanded or dissolved. But others remain. A directory produced by a group called the Fellowship for Intentional Community lists 540 North American communes. **********Outside Harrodsburg, the community that started in teepees thrives, though it has evolved. May Creek Farm Inc., now part nature preserve, part housing subdivision, is home to 10 families with 30 members, living in houses, not teepees. Each family owns its own plot of land; together the \"creekers,\" as they call themselves, own 200 acres of surrounding woodlands, which they protect from poachers in search of ginseng, goldenseal and the mushrooms that sprout after rain. **********The group's goal of self-sufficiency has had to be revised. While two families survive through artistic endeavors, several members go into nearby Bloomington to work: as a nurse, a school teacher, a dance instructor. **********There have been differences within the community \u2014 some members are Buddhists, others Protestants or followers of American Indian religions. And neighbors have finally overcome their fears of orgies or debauchery in the commune. May Creek survives, largely thanks to its members' love of a simpler country life. \"If I had to live in town again,\" said Heather Jones, 32, \"I don't think I could stand it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/world/unrest-indonesia-policy-strife-grips-indonesia-us-asks-citizens-leave-delays-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1998-05-15", "snippet": "United States urges most of nearly 11,000 Americans living in Indonesia to leave country immediately, citing worst political violence there in more than three decades; Clinton Adm also joins European nations in delaying $1.4 billion emergency aid ...", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Strife Grips Indonesia, U.S. Asks Citizens to Leave and Delays Aid Payment", "print_headline": "UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE POLICY; As Strife Grips Indonesia, U.S. Asks Citizens to Leave and Delays Aid Payment", "body_text": " **********The United States today urged most of the nearly 11,000 Americans living in Indonesia to leave the country immediately, citing the worst political violence there in more than three decades. **********The warning to American residents of Indonesia's two largest cities -- Jakarta and Surabaya, which are home to about 6,000 Americans -- was one of several moves announced by the Clinton Administration to deal with the fast-deteriorating situation in Indonesia, where thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest against the 32-year rule of President Suharto. **********The Administration also today joined European nations in delaying a $1.4 billion emergency aid payment and ordered the evacuation of all nonessential employees of the United States Embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesia capital and the scene of the worst violence this week.

Buck, senior vice president and corporate secretary of the exchange. **********The brokerage industry's practice of mandatorily referring employment disputes to industry arbitration -- as many brokerage employees agree to do when they sign their work contracts -- has gradually been eroded. Critics of mandatory arbitration have maintained that it gives unfair advantage to brokerage firms, and denies employees their civil rights by preventing them from getting access to courts. The proponents of mandatory arbitration say it is quicker, cheaper and more efficient than resorting to the courts. **********The change by the Big Board follows Federal court decisions in Massachusetts and California, which held that brokerage firm employees could take discrimination claims to court and did not have to submit to industry arbitration. It also follows a recent decision by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq market. That body recently ruled that the matter of mandatory arbitration in these cases was one for individual securities firms to decide for themselves. **********George Nicolau, a past president of the National Academy of Arbitrators and now a spokesmen on such issues, called the decision ''a progressive step toward fairness.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/26/business/media-expecting-the-worst-leisurely.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Kuczynski", "pub_date": "1998-10-26", "snippet": "Most of 800 publishers, editors, subscription agents, advertising directors and investment bankers who gathered at conference sponsored by Magazine Publishers of America in Orlando, Fla, express concern about potential for sluggish advertising sal...", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Expecting the Worst, Leisurely", "print_headline": "MEDIA; Expecting the Worst, Leisurely", "body_text": " **********It is safe to say that the mood of the conference sponsored by the Magazine Publishers of America in Orlando, Fla., last week, was one of caution. **********Most of the 800 publishers, editors, subscription agents, advertising directors and investment bankers who gathered at the conference expressed trepidation about the potential for sluggish advertising sales in 1999; they were concerned about the European and Asian economies and how the downturn of those economies will affect marketers' budgets; they sweated over newsstand consolidation, which is making distribution more difficult. **********''People are generally feeling scared to pessimistic about next year,'' said Michael Lafavore, the editor in chief of Men's Health, which is published by Rodale Press. **********But it was hard to be too gloomy in a world where most people wear mouse ears and there's a 60-foot-high plaster swan perched atop the neighboring hotel. Disney World, the Walt Disney Company flagship where the conference was held, does not provide the most serious environment for thought-provoking, chin-in-hand discourse. **********So while Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, spoke gravely about the economy (''the global economy is rooted in deep political imbalances,'' was one phrase), some found it difficult to regard him as soberly as they would have had he been speaking from a U.N. podium. He was, after all, at the Disney Yacht and Beach Resort, and remember, this is central Florida -- with no places to anchor a genuine yacht and no beaches, save for the Disney-manufactured ones, upon which to sun. **********Attendees could watch Steven Brill, the editor of Brill's Content, and Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., debate the issues raised by the CNN Tailwind controversy, typical enough fare for a magazine convention. **********But this conference also featured a unique combination: the chance to speculate about the economy, and the chance to watch an animated cartoon in a screening room in the base of an enormous, fake baobab tree at Animal Kingdom. While Michael Clinton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Hearst Magazines, shared his concerns with other publishers on a panel, he also got to ride Space Mountain for the first time. **********Mr. Clinton said that 1997 and 1998 were such stellar years for the magazine industry that it was natural for publishers to wonder how long the good times would last, especially after the recent fluctuations in the stock market. It has been a good decade, over all. In 1997, magazine advertisers spent more than $12.7 billion in the publications tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau; in 1990, they spent only $6.7 billion. In 1997, magazine advertising pages topped 231,000, according to the Publishers Information Bureau -- up 35 percent from 1990. **********''We are all asking ourselves, 'How high is high?' '' Mr. Clinton said. ''So as we look around at all the global markets, it keeps us very concerned about next year. Certainly, I think that the market in the last week or two has been encouraging.'' **********The real tell-tale sign will be retail sales this Christmas season, he said, ''because that's a great barometer of consumer confidence, and when consumers are spending, marketers will feel more comfortable about increasing their spending.'' **********Mr. Lafavore expressed concern about the 12 international editions of his magazine. **********''I used to worry about only one economy,'' he said. ''Now I have to worry about a whole bunch of them. Certainly, in Russia we launched less than a year ago and we came in late to a booming market.'' **********Mr. Lafavore said that he was also concerned about the editions his company publishes in Peru, Colombia and Mexico. ''And we were talking about starting up in Brazil, but things have taken a turn for the worse there,'' he said. **********William F. Reilly, chairman and chief executive of Primedia, which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the buyout firm, shocked some guests by saying in the conference's closing speech that he welcomed a recession because it might allow him to snatch up some new properties. **********Reed Phillips 3d, an investment banker with Da Silva & Phillips, suggested another benefit of downturns. ''A recession tends to lead to a shake-out,'' he said. ''There are probably too many magazines, and after a recession you would have fewer magazines. In some markets, you might have eight competitors where you should only have four or five.'' When those extra magazines close, he said, they stop diluting the ad market for the survivors. **********Perhaps Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, summed up the conference's surreality most eloquently, if half-jokingly. Mr. Kelly said that holding the publishers' conference at Disney World was ''akin to that sensation you get when you're standing at the edge of a vast ocean, and people always say that kind of moment puts your life in perspective. You realize you're one small mortal. **********''There's a Disney effect like that,'' he continued. ''All these people are going to panels and earnestly discussing the magazine industry and brilliant launches and how to conduct research, but at the same time you're surrounded by this endless Disney world that goes on forever all around you. And you begin to get this feeling. What does all of this matter? In five years, Disney will just own us anyway.

Dealers would also be allowed to sell the new lower-priced computers themselves, but under less attractive terms. **********A Compaq spokesman declined to confirm the report. **********Antony A. Ibarguen, president of Tech Data Corporation, one of the largest computer wholesalers, said:  ''There are dealers who tend to be paranoid'' about a company that adopts a direct-marketing strategy.

Anastasi, a computer stock analyst with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. ''Dell has been so successful it has conditioned customers to ask to buy direct. You can only say no for so long.'' **********Compaq has been losing market share to Dell, now No. 3, which has  grown faster and been more profitable because of the efficiency of its direct-sales model. **********The International Business Machines Corporation, the No. 2 personal computer seller, has also been moving to sell more machines directly, although it has mainly focused on its traditional base of large companies. **********''We will have the capacity to sell to all our customers directly,'' said David M. Thomas, the senior vice president of I.B.M. in charge of its PC group. ''For small businesses, our focus is on the small resellers' channel. We will focus our direct efforts on the large enterprise market.'' **********Compaq's new effort is aimed mainly at small to medium-sized businesses, a market that until now has bought fewer computers from direct sellers than either big businesses or consumers have. **********''The small and midsized business market is growing rapidly, but until now it has been very fragmented,'' said Andy Bose, the president of Access Media International-USA. The majority of small-business owners, he said, buy what the industry calls ''white box'' computers, machines assembled by local dealers. He said there was a huge opportunity for direct sales to small businesses because many companies were no longer buying their first computer. Companies are more secure and need less help when replacing machines. **********Over all, small business will account for about 9 million of the 36 million computers that will be sold this year, Mr. Bose said. **********Long recognizing the threat from Dell, Compaq has spent years improving its manufacturing efficiency and reducing inventory, a costly hot potato in a market in which computer prices often fall by 1 percent to 2 percent a week. **********Two years ago, Compaq introduced a direct-to-consumer sales effort via toll-free telephone calls. But the results have been tepid, mainly because Compaq kept its prices high to avoid angering dealers. **********''For nearly five years, we've been hearing that Compaq was going to get more efficient to compete with the likes of Dell, Gateway and Micron,'' said Joel Kocher, chief executive of Micron Computer, a direct sales company that focuses on small business. ''To date, their efforts have been less than successful.'' **********Compaq's plan to build a ''hybrid'' model that combines direct sales with dealer sales is fraught with peril, analysts say. **********''You cannot be all things to all people in all places in all industries,'' said Tony Amico, an analyst with International Data.

Each of the 16 keys call up musical sounds, each synchronized to play together in key and tempo. But Mixman has its limitations. Creating music with complex harmonic structures is practically impossible. Mr. Gabriel acknowledged that Mixman is best suited for creating highly rhythmic music that tends to depend heavily on repetitious elements. **********While some musicians have rejected the idea of inviting listeners to remix their finished work, others, Mr. Gabriel said, have welcomed it. ''They understand that there is something to having a fan appreciate in a deeper way what the artist is doing by letting them into the work,'' he said. **********A limited version of Mixman Studio can be downloaded free at www.mixman.com.

They might just as well be gift-wrapping spittoons. **********December 1998 finds the American workplace more casual than ever: Four out of five workers get to dress down at least one day a week, according to Peter Simon of NPD Group, a market research firm. And a recent survey of hiring executives by Management Recruiters International found that 42 percent believe the suit and tie will ultimately disappear. (Most of these doomsayers think it will happen in the next 10 years.) **********Consider the situation at the Pro Player sports licensing unit of Fruit of the Loom in Hudson, N.H. A company spokesman described the place as so actively hostile to neckwear that it bans ties from the premises. Until recently, the company had a rack in the lobby where guests could park these primitive totems; the rack was removed recently because no one ever turns up in a tie anymore. **********Times certainly have changed. In the days of afternoon baseball and snap-brim hats, of hair oil and smoker's coughs, men who pretended to any sort of social class wore neckties to ball games and apologized for being in public without a suit coat. The necktie was the emblem of masculine propriety. As Monica Lewinsky put it, in grand jury testimony that must have rung bittersweet with haberdashers everywhere, ''Ties were a big issue with us.'' **********If neckties are an endangered species, it should not be too surprising. They are the ultimate Freudian accouterment in an increasingly gender-neutral workplace. In that sense, the old four-in-hand can seem as Neanderthal as pinup calendars and secretary-chasing. **********Neckwear is also associated with a more formal era, when people worked in downtown offices and did business face to face. These days, more of us do at least some of our work at home, or in suburban office parks far from the public gaze. **********And in an age when everyone is cool and confession is valued over concealment, neckties can seem awfully buttoned up, their wearers secretive, rigid and constrained. On sitcoms, a high-school student in a tie is usually a geek, the sort of social climber who intends to run for student council president. He may be liked, as Biff says in ''Death of a Salesman,'' but he isn't well liked. **********So why do women (who account for half of all necktie purchases) keep buying them for men? Dr. Joyce Brothers has weighed in on the subject. ''It is a gift of manhood,'' she said, citing an ''implied intimacy'' that prevents women from giving ties to just any casual acquaintance or co-worker. A cigar may be just a cigar, but Ms. Lewinsky knew that a necktie is something else again, which is why she made presents of them to the Commander in Chief. **********There's no equivalent to the tie in women's wardrobes. They once tried floppy bow ties but soon abandoned them for a less derivative brand of business attire. And in men's wardrobes, there is no substitute: Without neckties to channel decorative instincts, men are left to flounder uncertainly in a sea of corduroys, khakis and ''dressy casuals.'' **********Chesterton once said, ''When man ceases to believe in God, he does not believe in nothing. He believes in anything.'' Post-necktie, we may be in for the sartorial equivalent. **********Besides, a necktie implies a certain maturity in a man, the way long pants once did. Should we really be wearing T-shirts and flip-flops to the office when we're past the age of reason?

''I had to wonder how many more corrupt agents like him were in that unit. What had they done to this inquiry?'' He said he intended to appoint new prosecutors and detectives to carry out the investigation. **********Mr. Madrazo said he and his aides first detected the infiltration after hearing of the gangland-style execution in Ciudad Juarez on Jan. 18 of Hector Mario Varela, a federal police commander, and learning that Mr. Varela had weeks earlier been assigned to work with the unit. **********Mr. Varela's assassins shouted ''This is to teach you to keep your word!'' as they fired 20 bullets into his body, Mr. Madrazo said. The style of the execution, as well as a review of intelligence files, convinced Mr. Madrazo that Mr. Varela was a corrupt officer who had been infiltrated into the investigation. Authorities are trying to determine who engineered Mr. Varela's assignment, Mr. Madrazo said. **********''It's absolutely clear that he was a narco-policeman,'' he said. **********The inquiry has centered on Ciudad Juarez, a gritty border city across from El Paso that is a crossroads in a multibillion-dollar drug trade and where at least 90 people, including several Americans, have vanished since early 1994. Most have had peripheral ties to the narcotics underworld, and many have vanished after being detained by men with police uniforms or credentials. **********Recently the Government inquiry has focused on a review of the way Chihuahua State handled dozens of missing-persons investigations, which federal prosecutors have said were sloppy and perhaps criminally negligent. Mr. Madrazo recently issued a subpoena to a senior Chihuahua police commander, saying he intended to ask about why the investigative files were in such chaos. **********The prosecutors also plan to question the commander about reports that he led families of the disappeared to believe that their relatives were being held secretly by the United States Government, a notion the prosecutors, as well as two United States officials, have ridiculed. **********Mr. Madrazo said he intended to take statements from the commander, Francisco Minjares, who heads Chihuahua's anti-kidnapping squad, and perhaps from other officials, as soon as he assembles his new team. Mr. Madrazo said he had pledges of cooperation from Gov. Francisco Barrio Terrazas of Chihuahua.  ''There are signs that the state investigations into the disappeared in Chihuahua were carried out in a very deficient and irregular fashion,'' Mr. Madrazo said. ''In some cases it appears that after people reported the disappearances, nothing was investigated. I told the Governor that we're going to have to formally question several public servants.'' **********In an interview on Thursday, Arturo Chavez Chavez, Chihuahua's attorney general, defended Mr. Minjares as an honest official but said his state's law enforcement authorities may have responded poorly as scores of people disappeared. **********''Perhaps some of our investigations were not well done,'' Mr. Chavez said. ''Maybe they should have been done better.'' On the other hand, he said, federal officials should not direct suspicions exclusively at Chihuahua police officials, since many relatives of vanished persons have accused federal officers of detaining the victims before they disappeared. **********Last year people from both sides of the border formed an Association of Relatives of Disappeared Persons to pressure authorities for a full accounting. The group's leaders have complained that investigations by both federal and state authorities have appeared chaotic or corrupt. **********With public awareness of the disappearances growing last year, Mr. Madrazo formed the 20-man unit and ordered its coordinator, Jorge Castaneda Espinoza de los Monteros, to review all investigations and to clarify responsibilities. Mr. Castaneda said in a recent interview that he had studied thousands of pages of case files and taken statements from more than 100 people in Juarez. **********Mr. Castaneda said several relatives of vanished people had told him under oath that during investigations Mr. Minjares's, the leader of the anti-kidnap squad, had urged them not to speak out because their relatives were in the United States in a witness protection program. **********''Minjares would say, 'Look, don't make waves about this, your relative is being taken care of,' '' Mr. Castaneda said. **********Lourdes Rayos Jaquez, an El Paso resident whose two brothers disappeared in Juarez after their detention by federal agents in November 1995, has testified that Mr. Minjares told her that one of her brothers, Francisco, was being held by American authorities in Houston. **********''Personally, I don't believe these people are being held in the United States,'' Mr. Castaneda said. ''I think that's an infantile accusation.'' **********In a Jan. 11 meeting in Juarez with families of the disappeared, James Ward, the United States Consul there, said he had consulted with many American law enforcement officials, and, ''I have never encountered anything that would lead me to believe that any of these people are part of the witness protection program.'' **********Mr. Madrazo said that last year he asked the American Government whether the United States is holding any of the disappeared and is still waiting for an answer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/12/world/rethink-india-s-communists-say.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1998-02-12", "snippet": "Jyoti Basu, West Bengal's Chief Minister and India's pre-eminent Communist leader, remains hugely popular despite Communists' failures; Basu, whose investment-friendly policies have put him at odds with hard-line Communists, has agreed to head coa...", "word_count": 1278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rethink, India's Communists Say", "print_headline": "Rethink, India's Communists Say", "body_text": " **********When Jyoti Basu arrived for an election rally in this town on the southern fringes of Calcutta, a crowd of about 25,000 people greeted him with shouts of ''Lal Salaam!'' meaning ''Red Salute!'' The podium was draped with red bunting and a hammer-and-sickle insignia. Mr. Basu's first words were in similar vein. ''Comrades,'' he said, ''I bring you fraternal greetings!'' **********In an India increasingly enamored of American-style capitalism, Mr. Basu might be taken for a man out of his time. At 83, he is the pre-eminent figure in India's fractured Communist Party. For 20 years, he has been Chief Minister of West Bengal, a state with 75 million people. His base is Calcutta, a city of 12 million people with dying industries and festering slums that is an archetype of problems that accumulated in the decades when India took the Soviet Union for its economic model. **********Despite the Communists' failures, Mr. Basu remains hugely popular. ''I love Comrade Jyoti and everything he stands for,'' said Vishwanath Mitra, a skinny stubble-bearded man who sat in the crowd clutching a red banner. Mr. Mitra, 42, said he had worked for years as a painter for 3.50 rupees an hour, barely 30 cents in the 1970's, before Communist reforms increased his daily pay to 60 rupees, now about $1.30. ''All I have achieved in life, I have achieved through this flag,'' Mr. Mitra said. **********But as Indians prepare for a general election that will culminate in a final round of voting on March 7, Communists across India are having to do some fresh thinking. For several years now, Mr. Basu's government has been hailed by Western businessmen as one of the most investment-friendly among India's 25 states, to the point that some Indians question whether Mr. Basu's faction of the party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), remains Communist in anything but name. **********Now, another ideological somersault seems to be imminent, forced by the political arithmetic of the election. Only 20 months ago, after a  1996 general election that produced the most splintered Parliament in India's history, Mr. Basu was invited to become Prime Minister in a coalition Government of 13 regional and leftist parties. Under pressure from Communist hard-liners, Mr. Basu refused, saying the party did not wish to compromise its principles by heading a Government that it could not fully control. **********Mr. Basu later described the decision as a ''historic blunder.'' But by then the coalition Government, under two lackluster Prime Ministers from center-left parties, was stumbling toward political oblivion, finally collapsing in December 1997. This led to the current election, and polls that have established a further rise in popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., the right-wing Hindu nationalist group whose specter forced the accommodations between squabbling groups that produced the coalition Government in 1996. **********This time, Mr. Basu and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have said they will join a coalition and will agree to Mr. Basu's heading it, if the opportunity arises. The reasons for the change of heart were made clear in Mr. Basu's speech at the rally here, in which he said that the B.J.P.'s rise had confronted Indians with a choice as crucial as any since independence in 1947. **********Although the B.J.P. has never been closer to winning an election, it has chosen not to play down elements in its creed that have prompted critics to say it favors a ''Muslim bashing'' India in which 700 million Hindus would suppress the rights of 120 million Muslims. In its election manifesto, the party has advocated a raft of policies that are anathema to Muslims, including plans to build a Hindu temple on the site of a 16th-century mosque, in the northern city of Ayodhya, that was destroyed by a Hindu mob on Dec. 6, 1992. **********To Mr. Basu, an atheist raised in a Hindu family, the B.J.P.'s plans amount to an assault on the foundations of Indian democracy, as laid down by Mohandas K. Gandhi and others in the independence generation. ''The choice before us has never been more clear, or more crucial,'' the Communist leader said. ''This is the 50th year of our independence, and the 50th year after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, and it is time to think of what kind of nation we have become.'' **********He added: ''After 5,000 years of civilization, do we want an India where political power will rest with people who destroy mosques? Do we want to be ruled by barbarians who will attempt to divide us on communal lines? Or do you want an India where all people are treated equally, whatever their religion, their caste or ethnic group? I say to all of you, this is a dangerous moment in our history, so you must think very carefully before you vote.'' **********For Communists, the B.J.P.'s rise  has required a shift in attitudes toward the Congress Party, which ruled in New Delhi for most of the country's first 40 years as an independent nation. For much of that time, Congress was anathema to the Communists. But recently Mr. Basu and other pragmatists have argued that Communists must identify ''the main enemy'' -- the Hindu nationalists -- and bury old differences with Congress. **********The logic has become compelling in the wake of the resurgence of the Congress Party under Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of Rajiv Gandhi, the Congress Party leader assassinated in the final days of campaigning for the 1991 election. Drawing vast crowds across the country, Mrs. Gandhi has raised hopes among Congress supporters that the party, in a slump for years, may revive enough to emerge from the election  with enough seats to lead a coalition. **********Recent polls have suggested that Mrs. Gandhi's campaign is making inroads into the B.J.P.'s earlier lead, perhaps enough to make a non-B.J.P. Government possible. Outlook magazine, a widely respected weekly, reported in its current edition that its latest poll, among 16,300 voters across the country in the last week of January, showed the B.J.P. and Congress neck and neck in popular support, with slightly less than 30 percent backing for the parties and groups allied to them. The poll showed 23 percent support for the United Front, an alliance of parties that formed or supported the departing Government, including Mr. Basu's Communists. The remaining 17 percent supported other splinter parties, or were undecided. **********One of Mr. Basu's trickiest tasks has been to respond to Mrs. Gandhi's emergence as a potential Prime Minister, a prospect that privately concerns many veteran political leaders who may be forced to join in a Congress-led coalition or, like Mr. Basu,  are considered prime ministerial candidates themselves. **********At Sonarpur, Mr. Basu described Mrs. Gandhi as ''a housewife,'' a term also used by B.J.P. leaders. But the Communist leader sought to differentiate his remark from that of the B.J.P. leaders, who have lost no opportunity to belittle Mrs. Gandhi. **********''By calling her a housewife, I mean only honor to her, and in any case I am not wrong,'' he said. ''I am simply pointing out that she has spent much of her life as many Indian women do, nurturing her children and running her home.'' **********As chuckles rippled through the crowd, the Communist leader added an afterthought, as if to preserve his ideological rectitude, and perhaps his hopes of becoming Prime Minister. **********''Some say Sonia is Italian, that she has no right,'' he said. ''But this is nonsense; she is an Indian citizen, and has as much right to enter politics as the rest of us. In any event, the issue has been overstated. The Congress Party is rotten to the core, and even if the Son of God were to appear in India, he could not save it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/20/technology/news-watch-turn-of-the-century-not-a-second-too-soon.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1998-08-20", "snippet": "Photo of workers in Dallas putting finishing touches on giant clock that counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds that remain until turn of the century", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turn of the Century, Not a Second Too Soon", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Turn of the Century, Not a Second Too Soon", "body_text": " **********Workers in Dallas put the finishing touches on a giant clock that counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds that remain until the turn of the century.

Soon she was persuading corporate recruiters to buy doughnuts from her to serve at presentations. The companies thought nothing of paying 50 cents for doughnuts that cost her a nickel. **********Following tradition, she was allowed to keep her profits. Breaking tradition, she made a small fortune -- enough, in fact, to pay for her entire M.B.A. education. The next year, the administration took the business back for itself. **********Mrs. Livermore has always set her sights high, and now she is suddenly in a position to scale the peaks of one of the most male-dominated industries in America. Two weeks ago, she was named to head the new Enterprise Computing Solutions Organization at the Hewlett-Packard Company, the world's second-largest computer maker. **********The promotion thrust her into the company of America's most powerful women executives. Enterprise Computing Solutions, which markets all of Hewlett-Packard's computers except for desktops, has 44,000 employees and estimated annual sales of $15 billion. ''Only a handful of women, including Carly Fiorina at Lucent, Jill Barad at Mattel, Andrea Jung at Avon and Lois Juliber at Colgate, have assumed operating roles of this size, scale and complexity,'' said Caroline W. Nahas, managing director for Southern California of Korn Ferry International, the executive search firm. ''It's a significant announcement.'' **********Her new job has made her a contender to succeed Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett's chief executive, when he reaches the company's retirement age of 60 three years from now. But Mrs. Livermore, who is 40, played down the significance of her sudden proximity to the throne. **********''Right now, what I'm worrying about is how I'm going to learn 17,000 new names,'' she said with a laugh. Turning serious, she added, ''I have never in my H.P. career thought about what my next job is going to be.'' **********That may not be spin. The secret of her success seems to be the intensity of purpose she gives to whatever task is at hand. Until she got her new assignment, she was vice president and general manager of the company's software and services group, which handles everything from Internet commerce and consulting to telephone support. There, she set a goal for her businesses to grow at twice the industry average. And for each of the last four years, they expanded by 20 percent or more, meeting or exceeding her target. **********She has also earned a reputation as an iron-willed manager, and considers herself a disciple of Jim Arthur, a now-retired Hewlett-Packard executive whose intimidating manner has made him something of a company legend. Yet Mrs. Livermore has a gracious manner that has made her one of the most popular bosses at Hewlett-Packard. She remembers a colleague once telling her that she was ''one of the few people who can tell you to go to hell and you'd look forward to the ride.'' **********Whether she is really material for the top job remains an open question, of course. A 16-year veteran at Hewlett-Packard, she is not a technology buff. Even so, those who work with her say she is a quick study on almost any topic. ''Ann can take a complex business situation and really understand the implications,'' said Joe Beyers, a Hewlett-Packard executive who worked for her in starting several Internet businesses. **********She views customer satisfaction as the key to growth. She breaks down the concept into three components, to which she gives equal weight: customers' pure satisfaction with a product; the likelihood that they will buy it again, and the likelihood that they will recommend it to someone else. **********Mrs. Livermore -- nee Martinelli -- grew up in Greensboro, N.C. When she was 8 or 9, her father, an insurance company executive, showed her some ''big old I.B.M. mainframes'' in his office and explained how they worked. She was so taken with them that she became a volunteer key punch operator, entering data for him. **********''At the time I didn't realize I was cheap labor,'' she said. ''But I'd sit down with pages and pages of stuff that had to be key-punched, thinking that this was the greatest thing in the world.'' **********Still, it wasn't love of computers that brought her to Silicon Valley. As a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she made trips to both Harvard and Stanford to decide where to go to graduate school. It was no contest. **********''In March, I visited Harvard and it was wet, cold, snowy, ugly,'' she said. ''I came to Stanford and people were sitting out by the swimming pool looking at their accounting books.'' **********Even before her recent promotion, her stature had grown. Last year, she became a member of the board of United Parcel Service. **********She likes nothing more than spending the day alone with her husband, Tom, an executive at a Bay Area packaging company, and their 9-year-old daughter, Emily. An avid skier and a fledgling golfer, she says she can still unplug more completely than some of her associates when she is away from work.

McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, made a dreadful mistake when he orchestrated a ''bailout'' of Long-Term Capital Management, the multibillion-dollar investment fund that bought most of its assets with borrowed money. **********Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, wonders out loud why the Government needed to rescue private investors. Jeff Faux, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, spoke for many on the political left when he questioned the fairness of rescuing millionaire speculators when the Government turns its back on bankrupt companies that employ low-paid workers. **********Other critics ask whether the Fed's action creates a destructive incentive, known as a moral hazard, for banks and securities firms to lend recklessly to investment funds, assured by last week's action that the Government would not let their investments go belly up. **********Good questions all. But the Fed has even better answers. The truth is that it orchestrated no bailout, created no moral hazard and set no bad precedent. **********First, let's clean up some language. There was no bailout because the Fed turned over no taxpayer money to the fund. **********Long-Term Capital is a hedge fund, a type of investment fund that caters only to investors who are rich and sophisticated. The investors raised a few billion dollars of their own and borrowed tens of billions more from banks and securities firms like Merrill Lynch. For three years its investment strategy worked brilliantly, but its investments soured this year. Because the firm had borrowed to the hilt, losses turned to disaster when creditors demanded their money. **********That, says Prof. George Benston of Emory University, ''sets up a classic free-rider problem.''  Each creditor grabs for its money while there is still money to grab. But if all the creditors grab at once, the fund will be forced to sell assets hastily, guaranteeing stupendous losses. A fire sale of securities would put the fund in about the same position as a family forced to sell its suburban mansion in 24 hours. **********''What Mr. McDonough appears to have done,'' Mr. Benston suggests, ''is to use the credibility of the Fed to bring the creditors together for their mutual benefit.'' Working together, they can keep the fund alive at least long enough to sell off its assets in an orderly, patient and perhaps even profitable manner. **********A bailout for the rich? For all the prattle, the fact is that the partners come away nearly empty-handed. The creditors, a consortium of banks and securities firms, have pledged to put up $3.6 billion in exchange for 90 percent ownership. Moral hazard? The deal nearly wipes out the misbehaving speculators and forces inattentive creditors to fork over money and take over the wreckage they indirectly sponsored. This deal hardly offers comfort for repeat offenders. **********There has also been talk that the deal smacks of hypocrisy. The United States lectures the Japanese to let the market weed out bankrupt banks and companies. But it is a stretch to connect the dots between last week's deal and Japan's neglectful bank regulators or its ''convoy'' system, under which strong companies prop up the weak. Last week's deal puts creditors in charge of a mop-up exercise. There is nothing to suggest they will keep the fund in business longer than it takes them to get back the best value for its assets -- unless they decide it can generate long-term profit. **********The Fed-brokered deal raises the larger question of when the Government should rescue bankrupt companies. Bailing out nonfinancial companies rarely makes sense because a government that protects losers will attract losers galore. But politicians sometimes cannot resist bailing out the likes of Chrysler and Lockheed -- huge corporations whose demise threatens thousands of workers -- even though research shows that few if any jobs are truly saved. **********Banks, however, are special. Burton Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton University, argues that bailing out banks makes sense ''because taxpayers are already on the hook for the federally insured deposits.'' And the Government needs to protect the nation's money supply. **********Most economists are unwilling to extend the safety blanket beyond banks even though the failure of hedge funds, securities firms and other financial concerns could in theory touch off cascading defaults that could infect banks because their loans would go unpaid or the value of their other assets would plummet. But it is easy to exaggerate the threat and, besides, the Fed can pump up an economy temporarily dragged down by sluggish credit markets. **********So where does that leave the debate over Long-Term Capital? It is not a bank, nor does its collapse appear to threaten the solvency of banks. It does not, then, warrant a bailout. It didn't get one. Mr. McDonough merely helped creditors take over the firm and spare themselves needless losses.

Biologists believe this is a device that continually opens niches for new species, thereby fueling the engine of natural selection and the growth of biological diversity, which has grown, if unsteadily, ever since the first explosion of large animal life in the Cambrian era 540 million years ago. **********The line that begins below traces the changing levels of diversity, as measured by fossils of marine organisms classified by families. The fossil record shows five major devastating pulses of extinction, not counting the present mass extinction caused by human activity (which some scientists believe will be the most severe of all). During these extinctions entire families and even orders of organisms were exterminated, radically redirecting the course of evolution. The human race evolved within the order of mammals, for example, but if the dinosaurs had not been wiped out, humanoid creatures might have evolved from dinosaurs instead. Dr. Dale Russell, a paleontologist at Ottawa's National Museum of Natural Sciences, has speculated that one dinosaur in particular, Stenonychosaurus, which had a large brain, walked on two legs, had thumbs and possessed binocular vision, might have become an evolutionary ancester of human-like creatures, but for the extinction of dinosaurs. **********Explanations for these mass dyings are almost as numerous (and conflicting) as the scientists who speculate on them. **********The most famous of the mass extinctions is the most recent: the one at the end of the Cretaceous period, when the dinosaurs died out (unless, as some scientists believe, some dinosaurs evolved into birds). The Cretaceous extinction, more than any other, has prompted bitter controversy. **********Many scientists assert that it was caused by the atmospheric effects of an asteroid impact -- possibly the one believed to have created a huge underwater crater on the Yucatan coast of Mexico. But other proposed explanations for the dinosaurs' demise include loss of habitat, climate change, the spread of diseases, a massive volcanic event in India, periodic fallout of cosmic dust, and many other possibilities. **********The Permian extinction of 250 million years ago is especially puzzling, partly because it was by far the worst in earth's history; estimates suggest that up to 95 percent of all the species alive before the extinction event (including all the trilobites and many other flourishing animal groups) were killed off. A change in the composition of the earth's atmosphere, volcanoes in Siberia and other causes have been suggested, but no one knows for sure.   MALCOM W.

Would there be huge gaps between the cost of a new house and the insurance payment? **********The answer, based on evidence accumulating here, is that the lesser coverage seems to suffice. Both the insurers and Florida regulators say there have been no complaints and, in nearly a dozen interviews, people who lost their homes had nothing but praise for their companies. **********''We couldn't ask for better treatment,'' said Aida Meltzer, an Allstate customer who lost her three-bedroom home here in central Florida, near the Atlantic coast. **********Many fire victims have collected more than they expected, and those who have come up short say they have only themselves to blame because they consciously underinsured their homes, taking what they thought was a reasonable gamble that disaster was unlikely. **********The key to making the restricted policies work, consumer advocates and insurers say, is in accurately calculating the cost of rebuilding a home and then adjusting each year for inflation and improvements. **********''This approach requires much more vigilance,'' said J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. But handled correctly, he said, it seems fair to both customers and insurers. **********While State Farm and Allstate, the two biggest home insurers, limit their payments to 120 percent in most states, Allstate has a ceiling of 150 percent in California and 125 percent in New York, Arkansas and North Carolina. Industry experts say the higher limits may attract more customers, but that with careful evaluations, the 120 percent margin should work anywhere. **********The industry's new approach, which requires regulatory approval state by state, has yet to be tested in the aftermath of a big hurricane or earthquake, when laws of supply and demand -- as well as profiteering -- can push rebuilding costs off the charts. In the Florida fires, the number of homes lost was not enormous, and prices for building materials seem to have changed little. **********Insurers also say they do not foresee problems in areas where real estate values are skyrocketing, because coverage is based on the cost of rebuilding rather than on a house's market value. A big part of a house's sale price often reflects the value of the land on which it was built. But homeowner's insurance covers the house, not the site. **********Insurance companies introduced unlimited policies in the early 1980's as a way to increase sales. They soon became the industry standard, so no insurer had an edge -- just a lot more liability. **********Hurricane Andrew cost the industry $16 billion in 1992, and State Farm took the first step toward retrenchment the next spring, refusing to sell unlimited policies in Florida. **********Instead, it instituted the 120 percent provision. Judith K. Mintel, a lawyer for State Farm, says the intent is to insure accurately the cost of replacing a house. State Farm allows for a 10 percent margin of error in its estimate system, she said, and throws in another 10 percent for good measure. **********SATISFIED that the concept was workable, the company began putting it into effect nationally in 1996, as state regulators approved it. And the competition has followed. The policies, which cost about the same as their predecessors, are now being sold in more than 30 states. Allstate is selling them in New York and New Jersey, but State Farm is still awaiting regulatory approval in those states; both companies await approval in Connecticut. **********The companies say that they sent notices to customers about the changes and that they instructed agents to spread the word, but details of the coverage apparently were lost on many people. Fire victims here said they did not realize -- until claims adjusters told them -- that they could get up to 20 percent more than what their policies specified. For that matter, they also couldn't recall a time when they had unlimited coverage; they believed that if they were insured for $100,000, they could expect $100,000 -- no more, no less. **********They were also happy to learn that they would receive several thousand dollars, in most cases, to remove the remains of their homes and for new landscaping. **********By spreading money around immediately, the insurers won many friends in Palm Coast, which has a population of about 30,000, scattered over hundreds of acres of thick woods a few miles from the beach. Within hours of the fires in July, the insurers were handing out thousands of dollars for living expenses; within a few days, many people had received checks for the face value of their policies. **********When Rhon Dixon, the owner of a window-blind and kitchen-cabinet company, drove up to the knee-high mound of ash that had been his two-story, three-bedroom frame house, he found a State Farm claims adjuster sitting in his driveway. **********''He said, 'Do you need some living expenses?' '' Mr. Dixon recalled. ''I said, 'Probably.' And he said, 'What do you need, $5,000, $10,000?' I said $10,000 would be fine. Then, about three minutes later, he said: 'You're going to need a deposit for where you're living. Why don't I just give you $15,000?' And I said, 'That's even better.' '' **********Mr. Dixon, 42, said he had never expected to use his insurance, had guessed at what might be enough coverage and didn't aim high. He never read his policy and doesn't recall hearing about the 20 percent cushion or other beneficial provisions. **********''You think your property is worth a lot, but when you talk with the tax people and the insurance company, you try to claim it's not worth anything,'' he said. ''Until something like this happens, it just seems like you just keep paying, and never get anything back.'' **********NOW Mr. Dixon has been talking with contractors about rebuilding. Their calculations show his coverage was low. His policy was for $108,900; rebuilding will cost about $150,000. ''It's my fault,'' he  said. ''I didn't have it insured for enough.'' **********The gap, though, is not going to be as wide as he first thought. State Farm has already given him $21,700 more -- the 20 percent -- plus $1,300 for things like replacing his driveway, sidewalk and a patio. And he expects State Farm to supply an additional $5,000 to bulldoze and cart away his ruins and about $5,400 more for new landscaping. Changes in building codes have increased some building costs, and State Farm routinely pays a percentage of those expenses. **********A more litigious person might argue that Mr. Dixon's State Farm agent should have made an effort to see that the insured value of the house was closer to the mark. Executives at State Farm headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., said that their policy is for agents, armed with the latest costs of building materials and a computer, to estimate as precisely as possible how much it will take to replace each house they insure. Mr. Dixon said the only estimate he knew of came out of his head. **********James I. Jones, 62, who got out of his house just as his trees were catching fire, was also underinsured. He thought his agent's estimate of $100,000 of coverage was low, but didn't argue: he did not want to pay higher premiums. Now that concrete block walls are all that remain of his three-bedroom home, he also blames himself, not State Farm. Mr. Jones says two contractors have estimated the cost of replacing his home at $135,000. **********Many of the Florida fire victims said their biggest insurance mistake was underestimating the value of their furniture, clothes and the other contents of their homes. An Allstate homeowner's policy automatically provides the equivalent of half the face value for the home's contents; on a $100,000 policy, the contents are covered for an additional $50,000. State Farm's automatic allocation is 75 percent. **********Aida and David Meltzer, retirees from Baltimore, were among those whose insurance coverage worked out just right. They did not cut corners and fastidiously updated their coverage. When they added a room to their beige-and-brown ranch house in mid-May, Mrs. Meltzer increased their Allstate coverage by $10,000, to about $80,000. **********After the fire, the Meltzers found it would cost about $85,000 to rebuild, well within the 20 percent margin. And they have decided to add a few frills out of their own pockets. ''I'm very well satisfied with the insurance company and all the people we've had to deal with,'' Mr. Meltzer said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/10/business/hoke-simpson-83-former-dean-at-columbia-s-business-school.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-10-10", "snippet": "Hoke Simpson, former dean at Columbia University Graduate School of Business, dies at age 83 (M)9", "word_count": 267, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hoke Simpson, 83, Former Dean At Columbia's Business School", "print_headline": "Hoke Simpson, 83, Former Dean At Columbia's Business School", "body_text": " **********Hoke S.

Today, it is worth pretty much what anybody says -- from 10 rubles at some currency exchange booths, to 20 rubles on an incipient black market, to 11, the rate set after Friday after brief trading on an electronic inter-bank exchange. **********Mr. Nikitin's problem -- shared by virtually all restaurateurs who have built business on Moscow's bubble economy -- is that much of the food he feeds his customers comes not from the Russian countryside but from abroad. And while he was hesitating about how much to charge for his dishes, his suppliers were not. **********''Sturgeon was 50 to 60 rubles a kilo last week, today it is 100 rubles, and that is the wholesale price,'' Mr. Nikitin said. **********A bigger problem was his deliveries of imported alcohol, which ground to a halt last week as wholesalers sat on their cases, waiting to figure out their value in Russia's fast-evaporating currency. Even though he pays his employees in rubles, their salaries -- like his rent -- are pegged to the dollar, a hangover from the turbulent days of Russia's triple-digit inflation in the early 1990's, a habit that lingered on long after the ruble reached stable levels in the last few years. **********Larissa, as an employee at the Moscow office of a multinational company, also earns dollars. That's good news, given the way the ruble has been going this week. The bad news is that she cannot draw dollars from the debit card her employer uses to pay employees' salaries. **********In fact, Larissa, who asked not to be identified by her last name, has not even gone near her bank all week, not after a colleague showed up late at work one day, with a tale of woe heard all across this dollar-infected city. **********The young woman had gone to her bank at 6 A.M., where she was the 41st person to sign up on the day's waiting list. At noon, the bank manager appeared to tell the crowd that there would be no dollars, only rubles at the fictitious rate of 7.8, an official level that has remained on the books since Moscow's interbank currency exchange shut down for business last Wednesday morning. **********''Some people are taking rubles in small quantities, some managed to take out their dollars before this whole thing began,'' Larissa said. ''I have decided to wait and see what happens.'' She said the company has said that on Monday, it will pay salaries in rubles -- at 9.5 to the dollar. **********These are dizzy days for Moscow's yuppies, who have grown used to big salaries, often paid in dollars, from the banks, foreign firms, real estate companies and other businesses that rode the wave of the capital's recent boom years. Many of these people are so young that they have known nothing but well-paid, white-collar jobs. Aleksei Smirnov, a 19-year-old real estate broker, stood in line at a currency office Friday with a fistful of dollars, which he wanted to trade at a rate of 12 rubles to the dollar. **********His first reaction when the ruble collapsed was to go the country. **********''We don't have any money in the bank, so we avoided that problem,'' he said, as he waited in line with his girlfriend Natasha Kolucheva, 18. ''We have our money under the mattresses. Natasha has several thousand, I have a bit less.'' **********But as luck would have it, when their turn came to go into the bank, the teller had run out of rubles, and the couple went looking for other ways to get enough rubles to get through the coming week. **********By mid-week, Moscow was in a mad spending spree. ''People were buying everything,'' said Aras Agalarov, president of Crocus International, which owns a chain of 70 stores across the city, from a giant household store on the outskirts to chic boutiques scattered around the center. **********Many of his competitors in the luxury goods business simply shut their doors this week, hanging out signs that said things like ''closed for technical reasons,'' or ''closed for inventory,'' which as excuses go, were not too far off the mark: they were in fact waiting to see which way the ruble will jump, whether to raise their prices by 10, 20 or 30 percent. **********Mr. Agalarov, who is also vice president of the Moscow International Business Association, chose another route. He stayed open, and sold at his old prices -- which brought a wave of customers, buying at twice their normal rate. **********''It was like having a big sale,'' Mr. Agalarov said. ''It was the end of the season anyway, so we already had marked goods down by 30 percent. The Government just went and added another 50 or 70 percent to the discount, that's all.'' **********Cars, real estate, washing machines, jewelry, stereos -- everything was getting swept by splurge spenders looking for ways to park their money before the ruble goes down any further. The giant AvtoVaz  factory in Togliatti, in southern Russia, reported it had emptied its inventory of the latest model of Zhiguli, the Fiat-lookalike that had been the staple of the Russian car market, before the recent flood of imports. **********Real estate brokers in Moscow reported a rush of buyers, looking to snap up new apartments and small dachas, or country houses, at something approaching old prices. In fact, according to newspaper reports, real estate prices have already edged upward 25 percent in Russian ruble terms, and where they will land at the time buyers sign their contracts is anybody's guess. ''Few people have enough money in their mattresses to buy an apartment,'' noted the newspaper Moskovsky Komsolets, adding that without access to bank accounts, it will be awhile before anybody has the cash to conclude any deals made over the past chaotic week. **********Like other retailers, Aleksandr Silvanovich, the 29-year-old director of ''Everything for the Home,'' a small household goods store in central Moscow, has been told repeatedly by his suppliers to forget bank transfers. With the Russian banking system now in gridlock, everybody now wants cash up front, he said. **********''Right now we are only buying domestic goods,'' he said, in between calls on his mobile phone. ''The prices on them have gone up 10 to 15 percent, but we are trying to hold down our prices, which means our profits are dropping 10 to 15 percent. Everyone is in shock. So are we.'' **********Mr. Silvanovich had been planning a renovation of the store, on the first floor of an old building. Now he has put it off. **********Mr. Nikitin is also finding that price rises are complicating his plans to open a second restaurant. ''Now we can't buy some of the necessary appliances we need,'' Mr. Nikitin said. ''I made calls on Monday, but no one is selling, or they are selling at 15 to the dollar.'' **********For Alik Guseinov, a 36-year-old flower vendor from Azerbaijan, the problem is that his roses, some imported from Holland, some grown locally, do not last more than three days. So people, out searching for more durable goods, are walking right past his stand outside a subway stop, even though he is now selling the roses at their wholesale price. **********''People are buying less,'' he said. ''They don't complain about the prices since we haven't raised them. But we know it's hard for people. They aren't getting paid, or they can't get their money from bank. If we raise our prices, no one will buy.'' **********Lyudmila Kazmina, 72, lives mainly off the pensions she receives as a  formerly high-placed administrator in the Soviet state film commission. **********But every day, she sets up a table on the sidewalk, selling a hodgepodge of items from romance novels to Orthodox church calendars to help out her daughter, Lena Orfani, 42, who lost a job as an editor in the documentary film division. **********This week, they were celebrating Lena's birthday but the dishes on their table this year were modest. **********''I invited my friends of course, but I have to say that every year it is more humble,'' Mrs. Orfani said. ''Now everything is more expensive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/world/yeltsin-s-nominee-besieged-is-not-without-allies.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1998-04-12", "snippet": "35-year-old Sergei Kiriyenko, Pres Boris Yeltsin's besieged nominee for Prime Minister, has shown himself to be adept politician in brief period on national stage; his liabilities, mainly his youth and limited Government experience, are also his p...", "word_count": 1591, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin's Nominee, Besieged, Is Not Without Allies", "print_headline": "Yeltsin's Nominee, Besieged, Is Not Without Allies", "body_text": " **********As workers took to the streets this week to demonstrate against the Government's chronic inability to pay back wages, a young Kremlin official huddled with labor leaders to defuse the protest. **********Even though Moscow has repeatedly failed to make good on its promises to pay the wages, the labor leaders agreed to give it yet another chance. ''Kiriyenko has given us hope,'' said Aleksei Surikov, the deputy head of the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions. **********In the two weeks since President Boris N. Yeltsin stunned the nation by dismissing his Cabinet and nominating the 35-year-old Sergei N. Kiriyenko for Prime Minister, Mr. Kiriyenko has run into a buzz saw of criticism. **********The Communist opposition has portrayed the Government shake-up as a grave political crisis. Some Western analysts have questioned whether Mr. Yeltsin is mentally competent to govern. **********But in the brief period that Mr. Kiriyenko has been on the national stage, he has shown himself to be an adept politician. **********To be sure, the appointment is an enormous gamble. Mr. Kiriyenko's  government experience is limited to 11 months at Russia's Energy Ministry. But his liabilities -- his youth and limited Government experience -- are also his potential strengths. **********Russia has a surfeit of holdovers from the Soviet era, like former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who talk about change but are mired in the old ways. **********It has bold reformers, like Anatoly B. Chubais, a former Kremlin aide  whose every move seemed to stir up opposition from Communists and powerful financial interests. **********But Mr. Kiriyenko is different. Unlike Mr. Chernomyrdin, he has made his mark as a young man in the brash new world of Russian capitalism. Unlike Mr. Chubais, he has not been in Government long enough to make a lot of enemies, and he eschews ideological battles. **********In short, Mr. Kiriyenko may be a leader who can quietly hammer away at changing the tax system, tightening controls over powerful monopolies and pursing other market-economy measures without the debilitating ideological battles that hobbled some of his predecessors. **********His appointment will be all the more important if, as Mr. Yeltsin has suggested, it signals a generational shift that propels other young politicians to the top echelons of power. **********The lower house of Parliament, as expected, rejected Mr. Kiriyenko's nomination. But that was just part of the horse-trading between Mr. Yeltsin and the Communist-dominated opposition, which wants to demonstrate that it is still an important political force and obtain a few posts in the new line-up. **********Mr. Yeltsin resubmitted the nomination, and most analysts expect the process to end in Mr. Kiriyenko's approval as Prime Minister. But he could be handicapped if the price of the Parliament's consent is too high and the new Government is seeded with members of the opposition. **********So far Mr. Kiriyenko has been his own best advocate. He has not boasted about Government accomplishments, has patiently stroked his critics and has even appropriated some of their sound bites. **********The newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta described his initial program, which he outlined Tuesday, as ''truly apolitical'' and devoid of an ''ideological lining,'' a rarity in Russia's superheated political scene. **********Regional leaders have been heartened by Mr. Kiriyenko's talk about reapportioning tax revenues so the provinces get more. **********Mr. Kiriyenko has tried to placate the Communists by emphasizing the need to struggle against poverty. Unlike other Yeltsin aides, he has not gone around boasting that Russia is  firmly embarked on the path of economic growth. **********Vladimir V. Semago, a senior Communist member of Parliament, said in a interview that he had met with Mr. Kiriyenko and considered him to be a politician in the tradition of Western European social democrats. ''I could see it in his eyes,'' said Mr. Semago, who added that he planned to support him. **********But economic reformers, like Mr. Chubais and Yegor T. Gaidar, consider Mr. Kiriyenko to be one of their own. And a review of Mr. Kiriyenko's career suggests that he has internalized the principles of the market economy. **********Born in the Black Sea town of Sukhumi, Mr. Kiriyenko, who married his childhood sweetheart, Maria, and has two children, got his start in the Volga River city of Nizhny Novgorod, which was called Gorky in Soviet times. His father was Jewish, but he adopted his mother's Ukrainian name, an effort to deal with the anti-Semitism of Soviet times. **********As a young man, he was studious and punched all the right tickets. He studied in the department of shipbuilding at the Gorky Institute of Water Transport Engineers, where his father headed the Department of Scientific Communism. After military service, he worked as a foreman at the Krasnoye Sormovo shipyard. **********He also joined the Komsomol, the  Communist youth organization, and from 1990 to 1992 was second secretary of the its regional branch. Mr. Kiriyenko has kept his Communist Party membership card as a kind of memento of those times, as have many Russians who are reluctant to write off years of their life as a waste. **********But unlike today's Communists, Mr. Kiriyenko was quick to take advantage of Russia's lurch toward the market. After a course on finance in Moscow, he served as chairman of a Nizhny Novgorod bank. He later became president of the Norsi oil refinery, one of the largest in Russia. **********His colleagues in Nizhny Novgorod dubbed him ''the little computer'' because of his organizational skills and attention to detail. One of his hobbies, however, is martial arts. **********''He had a reputation as a good manager and took a systematic approach,'' said Dmitry I. Bednyakov, a Nizhny Novgorod lawyer. ''Like every person he has drawbacks. His main one is his age and lack of experience.'' **********[Dressed in blue jeans and a sweater vest, Mr. Kiriyenko made an informal appearance, with his wife and two children, on an interview program broadcast Saturday night on NTV, Russia's private television channel. **********[As he described his working style and his hobbies, he came across as a cool-headed, tough-minded, ideologically neutral manager, a type increasingly familiar in Russia these days. In his case, he said, he felt no tug for the luxury goods that are often the mark of Russia's new rich. ''I like what I like,'' he said, pulling at the collar of his plaid shirt. ''I don't pay any attention to the label.''] **********While Mr. Kiriyenko has not been in Government long, his experience is hardly trivial. **********After Boris Y. Nemtsov left his governor's post in the Nizhny Novgorod region to work as a top Kremlin aide, Mr. Kiriyenko was also invited to work in Moscow. **********He was appointed First Deputy Minister of Energy in May 1997. (Mr. Nemtsov initially served as minister, in addition to other tasks.) **********In a nation rich in oil and natural energy, the ministry is a powerful agency. And as Mr. Nemtsov was preoccupied with giving interviews to the press and tackling social issues like housing reform, Mr. Kiriyenko was the de facto minister. **********In November, Mr. Kiriyenko was officially appointed Minister of Fuel and Energy. He helped set the terms of the coming auction of the Rosneft state oil company and negotiated with Americans on oil projects in Russia, among other complex issues. **********If Mr. Yeltsin dies in office, the Prime Minister becomes President for three months while an election is organized. **********Some people blanch at the prospect of a neophyte's finger on the nuclear button, but in shaking up his Government Mr. Yeltsin left his national security team intact, retaining his Foreign Minister, Defense Minister and national security adviser. **********Mr. Kiriyenko, who so far is not giving interviews to Western reporters, has said he made enough money as a businessman that he can afford to serve in government. He has a reputation for independence and is not believed to be the tool of any of Russia's business interests. **********Not that the Russian bankers and financiers have not tried. **********''I have already come across it,'' Mr. Kiriyenko told the Russian press. ''A careful offer of 'help' comes from somewhere. I ignore it. Then the next day some newspaper changes its tone.'' **********Certainly, Boris A. Berezovsky, the powerful tycoon, does not control him. The terms of the Rosneft auction that Mr. Kiriyenko shaped were decidedly not in Mr. Berezovksy's favor. **********Mr. Berezovksy recently began a media campaign against Mr. Yeltsin's Government shake-up and is backing the ousted Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has declared himself a candidate for the 2000 presidential election. **********Some of Mr. Kiriyenko's critics question whether he has the strength to be his own man. They say he may turn out to be nothing more than a caretaker while the real decisions are made by Mr. Yeltsin, his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and whatever group of financiers happens to be in favor at the moment. Before he was named Prime Minister he had met with Mr. Yeltsin only twice. **********''He isn't a political person,'' complained Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the head of the liberal Yabloko party. ''He doesn't represent any political forces. He is the technical executor of whatever the President orders him to do.'' **********Others say that the new Government may turn out to be too much of a hodgepodge to accomplish much. **********''It will have representatives from very different political powers, financial powers, elite groups and clans,'' said Nikolai Petrov of the Carnegie Endowment. ''So to expect from it some realistic serious steps in the realm of economics will not be realistic.'' **********But many reformers inside and outside of the Government believe that they may have found a new standard-bearer who may make headway as long as speaks quietly in  nonconfrontational tones. **********''The public understands what must be done,'' Mr. Kiriyenko said this week in a perfect example of his understated call to arms. ''The problem is how to do it, what mechanisms and instruments.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/business/karl-e-prindle-dies-at-95-made-cellophane-marketable.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Mcg", "pub_date": "1998-10-22", "snippet": "Karl E Prindle, industrial chemist who helped transform cellophane into mass-market wrapping, died on Oct 13 at age 95 (M)", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Karl E.

Prindle, an industrial chemist who helped transform cellophane into a mass-market wrapping, then devised a way for the masses to unwrap it without breaking their fingernails, died on Oct. 13 at a hospital in Willoughby, Ohio. **********He was 95 and was recalled as an inventor of both moisture-proof cellophane and the zip-tape strip used to open billions of cellophane-wrapped cigarette and chewing gum packages and other tightly sealed products. **********In a career in which he was always looking for an encore, Mr. Prindle made his most significant contribution to commercial science as a 24-year-old research assistant for the old DuPont Cellophane Company, which was based in Buffalo. **********Never mind that what people still persist in calling cellophane is rarely anything of the biodegradable, cellulose sort, but a petroleum-based product known as polypropylene. **********For the better part of half a century, cellophane was among the most ubiquitous and profitable products. But until Mr. Prindle came along, it was known primarily as an attractive, elegant and highly expensive wrapping for high-ticket items like perfumes. Because it was porous, it was unsuitable for wrapping cigarettes, candy and other products that required protection from moisture. **********By helping to develop a complex, four-component coating that increased cellophane's moisture resistance, Mr. Prindle helped lay the groundwork for a commercial bonanza that gave DuPont a virtual monopoly on a product that was not its own. **********Considering its long and close identification with E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, it is easy to forget that unlike, say, nylon, and other signature products, cellophane was not a DuPont invention. **********Indeed it had been developed in France in the early 1900's as the accidental discovery of a Swiss scientist looking for a coating to protect restaurant tablecloths from wine stains. **********By the time DuPont secured an American license to make cellophane in 1923, it seemed to have little mass-market potential. **********That is where Mr. Prindle came in. A native of Charlotte (pronounced shar-LOT), Vt., whose father operated a lumberyard and whose mother sold insurance to put her two children through college, Mr. Prindle joined DuPont soon after he graduated from Oberlin College in 1925. **********Within a year he had helped develop a moisture-proof version of cellophane that not only all but displaced the original, but gave DuPont a lucrative, second-generation patent that allowed it to dominate the cellophane market. **********Mr. Prindle was given full credit for the invention and had his name on the patent, along with that of his young boss, William Hale Charch. But it was DuPont, which had spent $15,000 on the research, including Mr. Prindle's salary, that reaped the millions in profits. **********Mr. Charch, who died in 1958, went on to a legendary career as a DuPont research chief. Mr. Prindle went on to another company and another cellophane milestone. **********Joining the old Dobeckmum Company, which was based in Cleveland, in 1932, Mr. Prindle turned his attention to another cellophane problem: the difficulty of opening anything sealed in it. **********While his invention will seem rather more crucial to anyone who has tried, say, to open the wrong end of a pack of cigarettes, his solution was as simple as it was ingenious: he put a stickum on a thin strip of cellophane and adhered it to the inside of the cellophane wrapper with a protruding tab that could be pulled to cut cleanly through the wrapper. **********It took some doing to get the stickum just right, but Mr. Prindle was a perfectionist if nothing else, and it is a tribute to his ingenuity that similar strips are still used on packages made of polypropylene. **********During his years with Dobeckmun, which was bought by the Dow Chemical Company in 1957, Mr. Prindle developed Lurex, a synthetic metallic thread widely used to give fashions affordable glitter, and scores of other products, but none that quite rivaled cellophane. **********He may not have shared in the millions his inventions made for their corporate owners, but Mr. Prindle managed to do quite well for himself. After his retirement in 1968 he concentrated on his hobby, investing, and made millions in the stock market. **********Mr. Prindle's wife Mary, to whom he was married for 66 years, is deceased. He is survived by two daughters, Janet of Manhattan and Anne Johnson of Dayton; a sister, Eleanor Benning of Charlotte; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. **********He had the satisfaction of outliving his own product.

The report also found that the congress had engaged in killing political opponents, including members of the Inkatha Freedom Party. **********In addition, it said the A.N.C. had to accept responsibility for the actions of President Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who was convicted in 1991 of assault and kidnapping after the death of a young activist. **********During the commission's hearings on Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela's conduct in the early 1980's, when she was the liberation movement's most visible leader, the panel heard testimony suggesting that she and her bodyguards were also linked to dozens of other assaults and deaths. **********Some 200 people have been notified that the report will contain negative findings specifically about them. They include two former Presidents, F. W. de Klerk and P. W. Botha, several current A.N.C. cabinet members  and the leader of the Inkatha party, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. **********Mr. de Klerk said today that he would go to court to block the report, which apparently accuses him of being an ''accessory after the fact'' in the bombing of a church headquarters in Pretoria in 1986. Although the report says that he did not order the bombing, it says that he subsequently came to know about the roles of others involved and failed to report the information to the police. This could open him up to prosecution. **********In a statement, Mr. de Klerk, who has often done battle with the commission, said he regretted having to go to the courts, but had exhausted all other alternatives and had to defend himself against ''unfounded attacks.'' **********But there are plenty of jitters on the other side too. Unhappy congress officials tried the back door recently, seeking to meet with commission officials to express their concerns. But that request was turned down. **********Some political analysts say the leaked portion of the report that dealt with the congress was probably a result of a calculated effort to defuse the impact of the negative findings when the report is officially released. But some say the reverse. The leader of the conservative Freedom Front party, Constand Viljoen, said the leaks were an attempt to give the commission credibility. **********The spokesman for the congress, Thabo Masebe, denied that his party was responsible for the leak and said that the A.N.C. would not comment on the report until it was made public. An advance copy of the findings were given to Mr. Mandela today, his office said, so that he could make a statement when he officially receives the report on Thursday. **********The creation of the commission was part of the negotiated settlement that enabled South Africa's peaceful transition in 1994 from a white supremacist government to a multiracial democracy.

It is Cyanotech Corp., one of the few companies that successfully leverages its location in Hawaii to compete internationally. **********Cyanotech makes use of the island's gifts in mass farming microalgae, a marine biological organism whose extracts are used to make a range of natural products. **********Its flagship product is called Spirulina Pacifica, a nutritional supplement meant to provide increased energy and natural anti-oxidants. **********While Spirulina is produced by other manufacturers, \"Cyanotech is head and shoulders above others\" in producing the substance, said Colin Watanabe, branch manager of National Securities Corp. in Honolulu. **********Walter Ramsley, portfolio manager at Walrus Partners, which is based in Holliston, Massachusetts, concurred. **********This is born out, he said, by anecdotal evidence from consumers and the more tangible proof that Cyanotech can charge more per bottle than its competitors. **********The company's geographic location in Hawaii accords it several unique advantages in producing algae-derived materials such as Spirulina, Mr. Watanabe said. **********The tropical climate gives the Hawaiian producer a consistent, year-round growing season.

These fish acquire the red pigment naturally when growing wild but come out paler when raised in artificial environments. **********An artificial version of astaxanthin is already successfully commercialized by Roche Holding AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical producer, which monopolizes what is estimated to be a $150 million-a-year market. **********Mr. Watanabe said the natural astaxanthin could potentially replace the synthetic version because it poses no health hazards and is absorbed more quickly by fish than the artificial one. **********About 30 customers recently conducted field trials and all reported favorable results, Mr. Ramsley said. **********Analysts said that Cyanotech stands to benefit enormously if the market opens in a country like Japan, where the aquaculture industry is expanding rapidly and where approval for natural astaxanthin from the health authorities is awaited. **********CYANOTECH'S Web site is www.cyanotech.com"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/world/harried-monitors-still-searching-for-20000-kosovo-refugees.html": {"writer_name": "Mike O'Connor", "pub_date": "1998-07-30", "snippet": "Diplomats tracking human rights abuses in Kosovo say they are unable to learn fate of more than 20,000 civilians who fled from Yugoslav Government counteroffensive against ethnic Albanian rebels; foreign monitors and aid workers say their movement...", "word_count": 847, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harried Monitors Still Searching for 20,000 Kosovo Refugees", "print_headline": "Harried Monitors Still Searching for 20,000 Kosovo Refugees", "body_text": " **********Diplomats tracking human rights abuses in Kosovo say they have been unable to learn the fate of more than 20,000 civilians who fled on Tuesday from a Yugoslav Government counteroffensive against ethnic Albanian rebels. **********As the Government attacks continue and fears of rights violations grow, foreign monitors and aid workers say their movements are being restricted by Serbian authorities. **********The United States and other Western countries accused the Yugoslav Government of brutality against civilians in past offensives, and after being threatened with military action by NATO, Yugoslav officials agreed to protect civilians and to allow foreign observers to monitor the Yugoslav military and police forces. **********But with the foreign observer mission badly understaffed and with access restricted, monitors have lost track of more than 20,000 refugees who fled Tuesday from Malisevo when the town came under attack from Government troops. **********''We assume they are in great difficulty,'' said a European diplomat. ''They must be scattered in the countryside in many places, but we don't know. There are many children and many elderly among them. Who knows what condition they are in.'' **********Despite these fears, diplomats also said they saw the possibility of negotiations between Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanians on autonomy for Kosovo. **********On Saturday the Government forces began their largest offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanians are about 90 percent of the population. In the last six months, an organization called the Kosovo Liberation Army has grown from a small group of insurgents to a broadly based movement demanding independence for the province. **********The refugees from Malisevo are among an unknown number of people who are fleeing the fighting. ''One has to hold the Government responsible for creating these refugees,'' a senior Western diplomat said. **********He and other diplomats said they did not have enough information to decide if Government forces had been so brutal that NATO action was needed. ''I don't want to say we haven't crossed the line and then tomorrow morning find there are 1,000 people dead in a field somewhere,'' the senior diplomat said. **********Foreign diplomats said there is no exact test for recommending NATO military action or further sanctions against Yugoslavia, which now has only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro. Rather it is ''a kind of consensus by all of us and our governments that would be reached if events became too terrible to countenance,'' one European said. ''But for the moment we are not learning what the truth is about conditions in the field.'' **********The foreign observers, diplomats and military experts, from the United States, Russia and European countries, were turned back by Yugoslav authorities in several combat areas today, they said. Near one town they were barred from, Junik, they reported hearing the sounds of heavy combat. **********Ethnic Albanian political parties say 20 people were executed Tuesday by Yugoslav forces in Junik. A senior Western diplomat said today that he had raised that report with top Yugoslav officials but had received no satisfactory answer. **********Foreign diplomats and monitors said that in many areas where they were permitted, villages had been shelled and many homes burned. **********''From what we could see, it looked as if there was an attempt to take territory and move the civilian population out,'' one monitor said.  ''It looks as if the Yugoslav Army is trying to keep its own casualties low by laying back and using artillery and tanks. That can be very hard on civilians.'' **********Some foreign journalists, traveling in a group organized by Government officials, visited Malisevo, which until the counteroffensive had been a rebel stronghold. They reported it to be deserted except for three families and an elderly man who said he had stayed to care for his cows. **********In Malisevo and area villages there were an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 ethnic Albanians until last week, when about 20,000 refugees arrived after Government forces recaptured the city of Orahovac. **********United Nations relief officials who were able to reach Malisevo last Thursday described conditions as desperate. Today they said that they did not know what had happened to the people there and that access for relief workers in most of the province was blocked either by fighting or by Government authorities. **********A Western diplomat said most refugees were probably in areas controlled by the rebels and would not go back to Malisevo or Orahovac even if the Government offensive ended. ''I think the Albanian public is terrorized by the security forces and not prepared to return unless there is a new security situation,'' he said. **********But diplomats also said they are close to arranging an alliance of ethnic Albanian groups that could negotiate with the Yugoslav Government for some kind of autonomy for Kosovo. This may be difficult because, while Western governments say they do not want Kosovo to be independent, most ethnic Albanians say they will accept nothing less. **********The diplomats say the Albanian political leaders have agreed in principle to form a negotiating team, though they have not decided on the team's membership or who will lead it. The Kosovo Liberation Army was officially invited to join the alliance only today, but it did not immediately respond, diplomats said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/16/business/equity-offerings-planned.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Offerings Planned", "print_headline": "Equity Offerings Planned", "body_text": " **********These equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week: **********Inktomi Corp., San Mateo, Calif., 3 million shares.

But no official figure was disclosed today, and in any case its size and implementation will depend on political developments. **********The draft, which is expected to be formally endorsed by the Government Monday, aims to create one million jobs and to stimulate consumer spending with less expensive  housing loans, about $57 billion in long-term tax cuts and the distribution of $5.7 billion in merchandise coupons. One proposal, a rollback of last year's increase in the consumption tax, was not mentioned in today's outline. **********Today's draft plan is clouded by uncertainty and could still be redrawn, depending on a process of courtship underway among Japan's political parties and factions. After a stinging election defeat over the summer, the Liberal Democrats have been struggling to maintain the upper hand, and have been forced to take up measures demanded by opposition groups. **********That is why today's plan includes a shopping voucher program, a demand from the small Komei Party. **********In addition, the Liberal Democrats  have also entered intense discussions to form a possible coalition with the Liberal Party, an opposition group run by Ichiro Ozawa, who stormed out of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, offending key members. On Monday, Mr. Ozawa plans to meet Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who returns from a trip to Russia that day, and if an agreement is struck, then today's economic draft plan would be rewritten to include some form of rollback in the controversial consumption tax. **********''If we reach agreement on a coalition, then today's package means nothing,'' said Yoshio Suzuki, policy planning chairman for the Liberal Party. **********The Liberal Party has called for a complete repeal of the five percent consumption tax for at least one year, after which the tax would be gradually stepped up again as permanent income-tax cuts are phased in. But some senior Liberal Democrats have resisted such a step, partly because it would be a big embarrassment for the party, which sent the economy into recession by raising the tax to five percent from three percent in April 1997. **********All this political jockeying has produced a package that economists say may prevent the bottom from falling out from under the economy, but that they also doubt will do much to nurture a genuine recovery. ''It's understandable how the package came together, for it seems a patchwork quilt that parlays to different interests,'' said Christopher J. Calderwood, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., in Tokyo. ''It lacks coherence or a theme, other than keeping things the same.'' **********Still, there are some elements of the plan that are likely to remain even if a coalition among the parties is reached. In one notable move, the plan suggested that the Government will take on a greater role as banker to alleviate the liquidity shortage that is afflicting cash-strapped companies across the country. Though the Parliament recently enacted two sets of banking laws aimed at easing the credit squeeze, new private lending by the weakly capitalized banks is unlikely to flow into the economy in large amounts any time soon. **********Under the Liberal Democrat's plan, the Government would issue tens of billions in credit guarantees to help midsize firms take out loans.  Moreover, in a two-year program, it plans to also make available as much as $40 billion in taxpayer's postal savings deposits to the Japan Development Bank, which would extend the funds to corporate borrowers who need to repay bonds and have been turned away by their bankers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/26/world/north-korea-warns-us-that-it-can-launch-another-missile.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1998-12-26", "snippet": "North Korea warns US that it is prepared to launch another medium-range missile; Clinton Administration has warned the North that such a step would jeopardize international aid it was promised in exchange for freezing its nuclear weapons program (...", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "North Korea Warns U.S. That It Can Launch Another Missile", "print_headline": "North Korea Warns U.S. That It Can Launch Another Missile", "body_text": " **********North Korea today warned the United States that it was prepared to launch another medium-range missile. The Clinton Administration had privately told the North that such a step would jeopardize international aid it was promised in exchange for freezing its nuclear weapons program. **********The latest warning, published by the official Korean Central News Agency today, said it was ''foolish for the U.S. to expect any change in our attitude.'' But American officials have said in recent weeks that they have seen no activity to suggest that a launching was imminent. **********When North Korea launched a three-stage missile over Japan on Aug. 31, it took the American intelligence community by surprise. Until then, American officials did not believe that the North possessed the technology for a three-stage ballistic missile, which gives the country the ability to reach all of the major American military bases in South Korea and Japan. **********North Korea maintains that the launching was intended to propel a small satellite into low earth orbit. While North Korean news agencies say the satellite now is broadcasting patriotic North Korea songs, American officials say their review of the evidence suggests the satellite either failed to get into orbit, or dropped out of orbit within hours of the launching. **********''We haven't heard a thing,'' one senior Administration official said last week, ''because it's not up there anymore.'' **********The political significance of a second launching would likely be far greater than any marginal technological achievement it might represent for the North. **********The Administration has been trying to rescue a 1994 accord under which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange for fuel oil and the construction of two civilian nuclear power plants. The United States committed itself to paying for the fuel oil; Japan, South Korea and other nations are paying for the nuclear plants. **********But the discovery earlier this year of a huge dig under a mountain, which the United States suspects is intended for nuclear weapons development, and the missile launchings have cast doubt on the accord. This month the North dropped a demand that it be paid in return for allowing international inspectors to see the new site; instead, it suggested that it would be willing to allow inspectors in if the United States provided more food aid. Some aid has already been sent to alleviate starvation in the country. **********A second launching would probably derail any chance that Congress would approve further participation in the nuclear accord, Administration officials fear. **********It could also derail Japan's contributions to the program. But missile launches themselves are not a violation of the nuclear agreement. **********The North said in its statement today that ''We will never be frightened by the U.S. warning,'' about further launchings. ''The U.S. still knows little'' about the North, a statement few American officials would dispute. **********The administration announced in October that former Defense Secretary William Perry would oversee a complete review of policy on North Korea. Mr. Perry then traveled to South Korea, Japan and China to assess the North's capability.

Yeltsin said today that he would call on Western leaders to help defend Russia's embattled ruble. **********His appeal was later echoed by a top finance official who said Russia would need a hefty rescue package from the West -- more generous than a $700 million loan already expected from the International Monetary Fund -- if it is to stem the panic that has threatened Russia's economic and political stability. **********Speaking at a televised meeting of Government officials hastily summoned to his country house, Mr. Yeltsin said he would call foreign leaders, including President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, asking them to support Russia as it proceeds with a plan for a new round of spending cuts and more vigorous tax collecting measures. **********''Foreign investors should feel confident there will be no collapse of financial markets in Russia,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, tapping the table for emphasis. ''The Central Bank and Finance Ministry today possess enough reserve funds to stay afloat. That's what is important.'' **********For now, the Yeltsin strategy seemed to work. The ruble was stable for the second consecutive day, and Moscow stock indexes rose. **********According to the latest report from the Russian Central Bank, Russia's gold and currency reserves now stand at $14.5 billion -- down from the $23 billion levels declared in October. Maintaining the stability of the ruble has been a key achievement of Mr. Yeltsin's reform-minded Government over the last few years, and as its desperate actions this week demonstrated, a stable ruble remains its top priority for keeping the shaky Russian economy on track. **********The arrival in Moscow tonight of a top emissary from the International Monetary Fund is seen here as a sign that some help is already on the way. John Odling-Smee, the fund's official in charge of Russia and the former Soviet Union, is expected to confirm approval of a $700 million installment of a $10 billion loan to Russia, delivering a seal of approval that has been closely watched by financial markets here and abroad. **********Meanwhile, Anatoly B. Chubais, a former top Kremlin aide and the head of Russia's electrical monopoly, was headed for Washington. Mr. Chubais maintains close ties to Mr. Yeltsin, and it is believed that he will consult with American officials about possible economic help for Russia. **********Sergei Vasilyev, a senior Kremlin aide, was also on the trip. The Kremlin declined comment about it. **********At a news conference held today in Kazakhstan, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, said Russia's latest efforts had convinced the I.M.F that it was serious about tackling its budget deficit. ''These are important enough that we believe we can release the next tranche of support,'' he told reporters, adding that an announcement would come in the ''in the next few days.'' **********But Deputy Finance Minister Oleg V. Vyugin said today that Russia needed the psychological boost of more foreign credits -- even if those credits turn out to be unnecessary. **********''Judging from the current situation, I can tell you that in principle there is a chance that we can resolve this situation without additional assistance,'' he said. But he added that  further credits ''would play a psychological role because panic is a psychological phenomenon.'' The amount Russia seeks, he said, would be ''a different order of figure.'' **********''Such a credit would show everybody that there are considerable resources and that there won't be problems in the future,'' he said. ''I don't see how such a decision would hurt.'' **********Financial analysts here said today that Western institutions and banks were unlikely to come forward with a currency-stabilization package for Russia anytime soon, preferring to see if financial markets will be convinced by the endorsements given Russia's fiscal program this week by the I.M.F. and Western governments, including Washington. **********In trading today on the Moscow stock exchange, the benchmark Russian RTS index rose 6.2 percent, winning back most of Wednesday's losses. The ruble, which was pegged at 6.17 to the dollar on Wednesday, rose slightly to 6.14. **********The fiscal crisis, which has dominated the news for days now, has for the most part floated over the heads of most Russians, who are more preoccupied with making ends meet than with the values of currencies and stocks. **********A key test of the markets' response will come Wednesday at a regular auction of Russia's Government-backed bonds, known as G.K.O.'s. The bonds will carry an interest rate of 150 percent as rates were tripled on Wednesday to save lure investors to hold bonds and the ruble. **********''Supportive statements by the I.M.F. and the U.S. Treasury are useful to show the markets that the support is there,'' said Christopher Granville, chief strategist at Fleming UCB, a London-based investment group. ''For the moment, the panic seems to have stopped. Then, the bluff will be called.'' **********Russian finance officials are exploring the possibility of a sovereign syndicated loan, which would be pulled together by Western banks, financial analysts said today. ''If they did get the money, the thing to do would be to restructure their loans, and buy back the G.K.O.'s, and cut their domestic debt,'' said Mr. Granville. **********At the emergency meeting held this morning, Mr. Yeltsin called on Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko to focus efforts on shoring up the ruble. Mr. Yeltsin said he would press Russia's tax authorities to improve their dismal tax collection record, an indicator that has been under close scrutiny by Western advisers. **********''Heads will roll,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, noting that he will meet on Friday with the law enforcement and fiscal authorities. ''They have been working poorly. They must be stricter.'' **********Mr. Kiriyenko said later that Mr. Yeltsin would sign a decree authorizing the tax police to confiscate property belonging to tax dodgers, with a list of major delinquents now being drawn up. Other measures under consideration would call for the forced bankruptcy of companies that have not paid their tax bills, and court proceedings against the managers of delinquent state-owned companies. **********At a Cabinet meeting today, Mr. Kiriyenko said the principal cause of the Russian crisis was that ''we have not learned to live within our means,'' a failure that he said had cost the Russian Government credibility here and abroad. **********Mr. Kiriyenko, 35, who became Prime Minister just a month ago, also met on Wednesday last night with four influential Russian bankers at their request. According to reports, the bankers were reassured by his pledge to stick to the Government's announced austerity plan. **********In public statements, several top Russian finance officials have blamed foreign investors -- who hold $20 billion in Russian Government securities -- for triggering the panic on the markets this week. **********''The market was rocked by a small circle of market players,'' Mr. Vyugin said today. ''We know them. We know about their operations. Judging from these operations, we can say with certainty that their purpose was to push the prices down.'' **********At a news conference on Wednesday Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Russia Fund, outlined the difference between the Asian and Russian financial crises. **********''In the case of Russia, the crisis is a Government debt crisis, a Government cash-flow crisis,'' he said. ''In the case of Asia, the government was rich, and the private sector was in debt. In the case of Russia, the Government is in trouble, and the private sector is very rich.

Those tactics are also blamed for creating the mountain of debt and system of crony capitalism that has contributed to South Korea's problems. **********The list was compiled with the assistance of South Korea's debt-laden banks after a review of 313 troubled companies. It is aimed at restoring health to the financial system and accelerating the reorganization in the country's heavily leveraged corporate sector, which has been slow to pursue change. **********The list includes 20 companies that are part of the country's five largest chaebol -- the Samsung group, the LG group, the Hyundai group, the Daewoo group and the SK group. The commission sent an earlier list back to the banks because it did not include chaebol subsidiaries. **********''It is obvious that the top five conglomerates must play a leading role in restructuring to overcome the current crisis,'' said Lee Hun Jai, chairman of the commission. **********But only one of the Big Five affiliates on the list -- the Hyundai Livart Company, a furniture manufacturer -- is listed on the Korean stock exchange. The ax will fall largely on small, virtually unknown subsidiaries. **********''Frankly, I am a little disappointed,'' said Cho In Kwan, head of corporate finance at Daewoo Securities. ''Some of the biggest companies in Korea have a truly unsound financial status, but they were exempted from the list.'' **********Mr. Lee of the supervisory commission said companies on the list had little chance of survival because banks and affiliates could not lend them money. However, the companies can sell off most of their assets to survive or can seek merger partners. They can also seek bankruptcy court protection, although banks are highly unlikely to agree to such conditions. **********It was not clear how many people are employed by the companies or how many would lose their jobs. **********The list includes 10 publicly traded companies, and their shares tumbled before the official announcement was made. The Korea stock exchange suspended their shares after the announcement, including Korea Tungsten, Haitai Stores, Haitai Electronics, Haitai Confectionery, Hanil Synthetic Fiber, Dai Han Wool Textile, Tong Kook General Electronics, Shinho Electric and Communications and the Young Jin Company. **********Under the leadership of the new President, Kim Dae Jung, the Government has promised to allow market forces to steer the economy, but the commission's list, dictating the life and death of scores of companies, seemed to contradict that commitment. **********''Deep involvement of the Government in corporate reform is not so good,'' said Cho Jang Won, a spokesman for the Samsung group. ''Now that it's involved, the Government has another burden.'' **********But many said that the list was probably necessary. ''Regardless of the negative implications, the overall effect is a kind of shock therapy,'' said Lee Jae Moo, who heads the Hanwha group's restructuring efforts. ''Instead of just guiding, suggesting, recommending or persuading, I think this kind of drastic action might be necessary in order to move Korean chaebol out of their old habits.'' **********There were some notable absences from the group marked for extinction. Samsung Motors, a new-car manufacturing unit of the Samsung group, for instance, is clearly not financially viable at the moment. Started this spring after the Asian financial crisis turned the South Korean economic miracle into a bust, the car company cost $4.8 billion to put together and must compete with already-established contenders like Hyundai, Daewoo and bankrupt Kia Motors in a domestic market now less than half the size of a year ago. The company, planning to produce just 80,000 cars this year, is not even close to breaking even. **********But Samsung Motors was exempt from the commission's consideration because it is to be part of another effort to compel the chaebol to restructure called ''the big deal.'' **********The aim of the big deal is to push the chaebol into consolidation by forcing them to swap businesses with each other. Hyundai Motors, for example, could adopt Samsung Motors in exchange for its semiconductor business, which could be absorbed by Samsung Electronics, one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors. **********Mr. Lee, the commission's chairman, said the top five conglomerates were to come up with revised business plans by the end of July that would, it is hoped, involve such deals. **********But the big chaebol have resisted such consolidation. ''That's a delicate matter,'' Samsung's Mr. Cho said in a discussion of Samsung Motors. **********Bankers said the list issued today was problematic for those chaebol that have already begun efforts to sell subsidiaries now fingered for extermination. The Hanwha group would have liked to put all or part of the Otron Company, a mobile telephone handset manufacturer that is on the list, on the block, but now any disposal would probably be a fire sale. ''It puts the seller in a very weak position,'' Hanwha's Mr. Lee said. **********The list is also likely to worsen unemployment, which has already hit more than 1.5 million people this year. While several chaebol said yesterday that they would try to find jobs for workers from companies on the list, it will be hard to absorb all of them. **********''We are going to try to minimize laying off people,'' Samsung's Mr. Cho said. ''But others are going to have a harder time, and the Government should share the burden for that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/20/world/un-gives-its-first-grants-from-big-ted-turner-gift.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1998-05-20", "snippet": "First round of grants from Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to UN will be announced on May 20, with nearly three-quarters of the initial $22 million going to help women, children and victims of war in poor countries; recipients of largest grants--and ...", "word_count": 682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Programs to combat violence against women in Latin America, provide better reproductive health services in Asia and Africa and aid victims of land mines in six countries are also included. **********The fund, formally established in January as the United Nations Foundation, plans to disburse $100 million a year over the next decade from the sale of up to 18 million shares of Mr. Turner's Time Warner stock, acquired when his company, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., merged with Time Warner in 1996. **********The grant, announced last year, is the largest gift the United Nations has ever received from a private source. United Nations agencies and programs compete for the money by submitting proposals. **********The recipients of the largest grants -- and more than half of the  initial $22 million -- will be the United Nations Population Fund and Unicef, the United Nations children's fund. **********The biggest single award -- $3 million -- is to the population fund in Bolivia for developing bilingual Spanish-Quechua literacy among rural women to improve their understanding of their reproductive health options. A grant of $860,000 goes to a Unicef project supplying vitamin supplements to mothers in Indonesia's province of West Timor, an extremely poor area lost in the shadow of East Timor, the disputed territory with which it shares an island. **********''We set four broad priority areas: Women and population stabilization, sustainable environment and climate change, children's health, and strengthening the U.N. system,'' said Mr. Wirth, a former Democratic Senator from Colorado and Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs. **********The areas generally reflect the interest of Mr. Turner and Jane Fonda, his wife. But environmental projects are noticeably absent from the larger grants. **********''The environmental group isn't as strong as we would like it to be,'' Mr. Wirth said. ''Some of the projects that were recommended were basically infrastructure projects, which is not the sort of things we ought to be doing in terms of preventive and innovative programs.'' **********In one of only three environmental projects of 22 supported in the first round of grants, the United Nations Foundation allocated $900,000 for a joint one-year project of the United Nations Development Program and the World Resources Institute to help China, the world's second-largest source of greenhouse gases, consolidate information about policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. **********Two other environmental grants totaling about $520,000 go to an assessment of the global environment by young people to encourage them to focus on the future, and to a United Nations task force studying environment in relation to human settlements. **********Last week, the United Nations Foundation chose its international board of directors, of which Mr. Turner is the chairman. Other directors are Ruth Cardoso of Brazil, an anthropologist who works in anti-poverty programs; Graca Machel, a former education minister of Mozambique who produced a United Nations study on children at war; Emma Rothschild, director of the Center for History and Economics at King's College, Cambridge, and a fellow at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies; Maurice Strong, a Canadian businessman who was Secretary General of the Rio Earth Summit; Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and now co-chairman of Good Works International, a consulting group, and Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which pioneered small-scale credit programs for women. Mr. Wirth is also a member of the board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/02/business/media-business-advertising-purchasing-power-women-rises-marketers-start-pay-more.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1998-07-02", "snippet": "Growing number of companies have developed direct advertising campaigns aimed at women, who have become lucrative consumer group, marketing products and services that were once pitched almost exclusively to men (Advertising Column) (M)", "word_count": 1023, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As the purchasing power of women rises, marketers start to pay more attention to them.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; As the purchasing power of women rises, marketers start to pay more attention to them.", "body_text": " **********MISS MANNERS would not be amused. **********Women are buying jewelry with their own money. They are playing professional basketball. And fewer are waiting for the wedding to buy the house in the suburbs. To tap into this increasingly lucrative consumer group, a growing number of companies are now marketing directly to women products and services that were once pitched almost exclusively to men. Companies that sell everything from golf equipment to life insurance are more frequently using advertising aimed solely at women to let them know they want their business. **********Patek Philippe, the luxury watch maker, for instance, saw a shift in consumers' buying habits a couple of years ago when women began to buy more of its expensive men's timepieces for themselves. That prompted the conservative Swiss company to think differently about how it communicated with women. **********''We believe in it enough to make it a focus of our advertising worldwide,'' said Hank Edelman, the United States president of Patek, which is based in Geneva. **********So this year, Patek is spending half of its $15 million marketing budget on promotions aimed at women, a 15 percent increase from three years ago. And a primary focus of its approach will be a print campaign focused on women for an $11,800 watch with mechanical movement and dual time zones, features that until now the company only included in men's watches. **********The ads, which will appear in national newspapers and magazines this fall, were created by Leagas Delaney in London. They represent a departure from Patek's usual method of featuring jeweled watches on the arms of the ladies-who-lunch set. In one of the new ads, a woman in jeans is teaching her daughter to ride a bike. It carries the slogan  ''Begin your own tradition.'' **********''You look at where the greatest potential growth is, and there is a whole segment of the population that has not had an interest in things like this that were thought of being traditionally masculine,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''Younger women and working women have a greater range of interests.'' **********One reason is that the 20-somethings are erasing the lines between traditional male and female roles (think WNBA and the Citadel). And with the aging of baby boomers comes a generation of women now in their peak earning years who, more than ever, are making the financial decisions in their households. **********''Women are buying houses by themselves, and women are buying all kinds of other products that before had been sold to a dual audience,'' said Anne Marshall, a partner at Women Trend, a consulting firm in Washington that is part of Holman Communications. Even so, she said, she has a sense that far too many ads are still right out of the June Cleaver era. **********''It is not just a matter of putting women in a spot anymore,'' Ms. Marshall said. ''The point is finding messages that will resonate with reality and are not condescending. A lot of them are just plain rude, where they say, 'You are not the bride and you are not this.' What does that have to do with running shoes?'' **********Well, nothing. But marketers are making progress, according to Advertising Women of New York, an industry group. ''When we started to look at what marketers were doing who were successful, we found a number in categories not traditionally marketing to women who were doing very well,'' said Toni Lee, a spokeswoman for the group. **********The group points to Nike Inc. and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, for instance. John Hancock has been focusing on single parents and working women with two series of ads on cable television channels. **********''Hancock has gone from talking to men and women in general to talking to a very specific segment of women whose financial needs happen to be even more critical because of their situation,'' said Karen Kaplan, a vice president who oversees the Hancock account at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in Boston. ''We are trying to communicate an understanding of their unique needs.'' **********The agency is working on a new series of ads to be added to the campaign under the original slogan ''Insurance for the unexpected. Investments for the opportunities.'' The new spots are expected to hit the market in the first quarter of next year. **********Nike is also expanding its focus on the women's market, and recently started a series of commercials tied to the WNBA. **********''Last year we had a lot of 'Go women,' inspirational kind of stuff,'' said Kathryn Reith, a company spokeswoman. ''So what we did this summer is really sort of focus on what we think is special about the league, and that is the relationship between the players and fans.'' **********This year's spots, which began running last month on NBC, part of the General Electric Company, the Walt Disney Company's ESPN and the Lifetime cable network, will run through August and feature young girls interacting with the league's stars. The message? ''This is what you should be doing with your game,'' Ms. Reith said. **********''One of the things it does is really help to continue to tie us to performance athletic gear,'' she said of the commercials, which were created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, a unit of Omnicom Group in San Francisco. ''Certainly we've seen a growth of the visibility of the players, which we hope will spill over into product sales.'' **********Looking to tap into the growing number of women taking part in another sport, the Arnold Palmer Golf Company has created a line of women's golf equipment called Nancy Lopez Golf. The company began a campaign to market the product line in April, and plans to expand the campaign this fall to include national television advertising. **********''This company has invested significant seven figures on this whole endeavor,'' said Cindy Davis, Palmer's president. The print ads, created by a San Diego graphic design firm, Miriello Grafico, are running in national women's golf magazines under the slogan ''Defining the women's game.'' **********In general, ''as companies are realizing they are valuable consumers, we are taking it more seriously both in the funding we put behind a brand as well as the way we communicate to that consumer,'' Ms. Davis said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/world/beijing-taiwan-talks-intimate-rivals-to-meet.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "1998-10-12", "snippet": "Continuing test of wills between Taiwan and China enters new phase on October 14, with visit of senior Taiwan official to Shanghai and Beijing--first high-level contact between both sides in five years; China regards recovery of Taiwan as its over...", "word_count": 1200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beijing-Taiwan Talks: Intimate Rivals to Meet", "print_headline": "Beijing-Taiwan Talks: Intimate Rivals to Meet", "body_text": " **********From the bluffs along the edge of this booming Chinese city, you can easily peer into Taiwan's western frontier, a small island only half a mile away. **********From the early 1950's to 1979, artillery here ritually pounded the nearby islands of Jinmen, known in the West as Quemoy, and other locations. **********On these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat, for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars, China's proposal for luring ''renegade'' Taiwan back into the fold: ''One Country, Two Systems to Reunify China.'' **********Across the water Taiwan, in response, has put up a huge white billboard calling for reunification according to the ''Three People's Principles'' propounded early this century by the founder of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen: nationalism, democracy and better livelihood. **********The dueling signs, erected last year, express the continuing test of wills between China and Taiwan -- a struggle that will enter a new phase on Wednesday with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides. **********Although Taiwan and China these days exchange symbolic gestures, even smiles, rather than artillery shots, the visit of a senior Taiwan official to Shanghai and Beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what they will discuss. **********Wary officials on Taiwan insist on calling this ''a visit, not talks.'' They may agree on little more than to talk again in the future. But because the stakes are so high, people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and in Washington, will be scrutinizing every inflection. **********China sees recovering sovereignty over Taiwan as the unfinished business of the civil war that brought Communist victory on the mainland in 1949. China ceaselessly calls the recovery of Taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal. **********Taiwan, which has created prosperity and democracy, no longer claims, as it once did, to house the true government of all China. More and more, its 22 million people say they feel an independent identity. **********Taiwan's leaders, mindful of the glowering colossus nearby, still profess to want reunification -- some day far in the future, when China, too, is prosperous and democratic. For now they insist that China and the world must recognize Taiwan as a separate entity. **********In a typical speech on Saturday, the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, called for a ''gradualist approach'' toward unity. **********''We are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided rule,'' he said, promising continued efforts to break free of the diplomatic strangulation pursued by Beijing. **********Visiting China from Oct. 14 to 19 will be Koo Chen-fu, head of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation. He is to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. In what is seen as a good-will gesture by Beijing, Mr. Koo is also to meet the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, on Oct. 18. **********Mr. Koo and Mr. Wang held their first, and only, official talks in Singapore in 1993. Their next scheduled meeting, in 1995, was canceled by China when it was angered by President Lee's visit to a class reunion at Cornell University, seen as a perfidious effort to bolster Taiwan's independent status. **********The next year, relations became more tense when China conducted missile tests near Taiwan during the island's presidential election and the United States sent aircraft carriers into the region. **********Since then the United States, worried about being dragged into a conflict, has encouraged both sides to resume talks. **********Despite their diverging goals, both sides may feel that their interests are served by meeting, said a Western diplomat in Beijing. ''For Taiwan, if China is talking it's not attacking, and for China, if Taiwan is talking then it's not declaring independence,'' the diplomat said. **********China has called for immediate discussions of the political future, offering a deal looser than Hong Kong's in which Taiwan could keep its democracy and even its army but come under Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations, limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and immigration disputes. **********Complicating the matter, China and Taiwan are increasingly intertwined economically and socially, a process China encourages and Taiwan is struggling to limit. **********The ties are apparent here in Xiamen, one of China's thriving ''special economic zones'' that is host to many Taiwan factories, real estate developments and tourists. **********In the last few days, among hundreds of visiting ''compatriots,'' as they are always called here, were 24 members of a Taipei golf club who came to play Xiamen's three golf courses and sightsee. Also visiting, at the invitation of the Elders' Society of Xiamen, were 21 men and women from a Taiwan senior citizens' group, who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities. **********More than a million business executives and tourists from Taiwan visit China each year, and some 50,000 live here, the Western diplomat said. In contrast, Taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland. **********Taiwan's investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing, even as its Government tries to enforce its slogan of ''Go slow; be patient.'' **********The Taiwan Government has refused to allow large, showcase investments like multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power projects in Fujian Province that were planned by the giant Formosa Plastics Group. **********Many Taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy, and the Formosa Group's chairman, Wang Yung-ching, has publicly urged his Government to relax it. ''We fear we will lose our opportunity'' in China, he said in a recent speech. **********Most important, Taiwan does not allow direct transportation, postal or communications links with the mainland. This slows cross-strait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping through Hong Kong or Macao. **********Capt. Yao Ming-fu of the Taiwan-owned ship Uni-Pioneer, in Xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to Japan or Southeast Asia, expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen. **********Taking goods directly from here to Taiwan's main harbor takes about 12 hours, he said. But his ship can only carry Chinese-made goods for reshipment onward; none can be imported into Taiwan. **********Transporting Chinese goods to Taiwan itself requires a 24-hour boat trip to Hong Kong, some bothersome paperwork, then another 14-hour journey to Taiwan, said Captain Yao. His parent company, the Evergreen Group, is one of the world's largest shippers. **********Taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale direct commerce in both directions among islands around Xiamen, and people from Taiwan even make one- to five-day visits across these waters, say local press reports and scholars. **********How long this strange dance between China and Taiwan can continue is unknown. China has warned that if Taiwan formally declares independence, it will mount a military attack -- a regional catastrophe. Short of such a declaration, what action by Taiwan might touch off a harsh response? How long will China's patience hold? **********Major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely, Fan Xihou, director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, said in an interview. But after that, he suggested, ''time will be against Taiwan'' as China's military and economic strength builds. **********Taiwan, for its part, hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at home and abroad to shape the terms of its future relationship with the would-be motherland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/31/technology/news-watch-makeover-cd-s-get-a-fresh-face.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1998-12-31", "snippet": "Essence magazine and Mindscape market makeover software for black women (News Watch) (S)", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Makeover CD's Get a Fresh Face", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Makeover CD's Get a Fresh Face", "body_text": " **********The Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover CD-ROM's have sold 270,000 copies to date, a splash big enough to lure others into the pond.

Other Wall Street firms, which along with Merrill Lynch had swelled their ranks on the fat profits of the rampant bull market, are expected to follow suit. Merrill Lynch said it expected ''a much more challenging environment ahead'' for financial companies. **********The job cuts, which the firm said would save $500 million a year, are expected to fall heavily on New York City, where Merrill Lynch said it would dismiss up to 700 of its 10,500 employees. Altogether in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the firm said it would lay off 1,100 employees and 500 full-time consultants and eliminate 400 more jobs through attrition. As many as 800 of the total cuts will be made through attrition. **********But jobs will be lost across the company, Merrill Lynch executives said, with 2,000 coming in the United States and 1,400 coming overseas. In Europe, for example, the company plans to eliminate 400 jobs. **********Merrill Lynch also said it would dismiss 900 full-time consultants, who are mostly involved in technology projects, although David H. Komansky, Merrill Lynch's chairman and chief executive, insisted in an interview yesterday that this would not hamper the company's ability to deal with either Europe's coming introduction of the euro or computer problems associated with the year 2000. **********Merrill Lynch, like many financial firms, retains many full-time consultants, particularly for technology projects, who are not company employees. **********Merrill also reported a loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months ended on Sept. 30 after taking a $430 million charge, or $288 million after taxes, to pay for the job cuts. Excluding that charge, Merrill Lynch showed a profit of $124 million for the quarter as earnings were squeezed by the slowdown in underwriting and securities trading and the fallout from worldwide economic turmoil. In the third quarter of 1997, Merrill Lynch earned $502 million. This year's third quarter represented its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1989, when the firm was in the midst of cutting the jobs of 9,000 people, or 18 percent of its work force, over roughly two years. **********Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York expressed dismay in an interview yesterday about the layoffs at Merrill Lynch, which he said was the largest employer in the city. But he was sympathetic about the cutbacks, saying: ''This is not something they're doing because they want to do it. This is something they're doing because they have problems on Wall Street right now.'' The city is better able to withstand a downturn on Wall Street than it was in the past, the Mayor said. **********But the Mayor acknowledged that the layoffs were bad news for the city. ''Wall Street also has a psychological impact on the City of New York because people who aren't directly affected by it make decisions about how much they're going to spend, when they're going to spend it, based on what's happening on Wall Street,'' he said. **********Last year, Merrill Lynch received $28 million in tax incentives from New York City and New York State in return for agreeing to add 2,000 employees over 15 years to the 9,000 it had. Even after the current round of layoffs, Merrill Lynch will have 9,800 employees in the city, the company said in a statement, ''and we are fully confident that our strategy for long-term growth in all of our businesses will enable us to meet our employment commitment.'' **********Merrill Lynch's job cuts and its forecast of tougher times to come yesterday cast a shadow over Wall Street, which until July had enjoyed its most profitable years in living memory. ''Those of us in the equity business say there but for the grace of God go we,'' said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company, the New York securities firm. But she added, ''If Merrill is right, there will be more layoffs and more poor quarters for the industry,'' which is one of New York's biggest employers, and certainly its richest business. **********The job cuts at Merrill Lynch, which are expected to fall heavily on bond specialists, were widely expected after Japan's economic problems deepened and Russia abrogated its debts in mid-August, casting a pall over the world's bond and credit markets. The company in recent weeks would say only that it was ''reviewing the matter,'' but there had been news reports that the cutbacks would range from more than 1,000 to as many as 3,000 jobs. **********Along with recently announced job cuts at the new Citigroup -- the combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp -- and others now being considered at several other financial companies, the cuts at Merrill Lynch are likely to affect the New York economy, particularly local consumer spending and the real estate market. The cuts at Citigroup, however, are in part related to the recent merger, although they also included a significant scaling back of the riskier bond businesses at Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's investment bank. **********Merrill Lynch's financial results also seemed to disappoint analysts yesterday. ''This is clearly not being viewed as a one-quarter problem,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call, a research firm in Boston. ''This came in way below expectations for the quarter, and analysts are cutting their estimates for the coming year.'' **********Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, ''We were all expecting the revenues to be weak, but the expenses were just very high across the board.'' **********''This is partly the result of an aggressive expansion policy the year before the downturn in the securities markets,'' he added. Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch's stock price rose $1.0625 yesterday, to $44.9375, but is still well below its high of nearly $110 in July. **********Mr. Komansky defended Merrill Lynch's rapid expansion of recent years, and particularly its adventurous acquisitions here and abroad. ''Many of them were transforming the nature of this firm,'' he said, and ''fit in with our global strategy.'' **********Two other big brokerage firms -- Paine Webber Group and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. -- also reported lower earnings yesterday as they, too, suffered from the slower securities markets. At Paine Webber, which has a large nationwide brokerage business, earnings fell to $82.9 million, or 51 cents a share, from $112.8 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier, just beating a consensus of analysts' estimates. Donaldson, Lufkin reported earnings of $25.7 million, or 15 cents a share, for the quarter, down almost 80 percent from a year earlier. **********''It's a bond market, credit crash round the world,'' said Donald B. Marron, the chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber. His firm, which has much smaller international and capital markets businesses than Merrill Lynch, is not scaling back, he said, but he expressed concern that the international economy might adversely affect the United States economy. **********The Merrill Lynch cuts are likely to be followed by other firms in the coming weeks. ''Notifications started going out today,'' Jonathan Humphreys, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, said yesterday. Mr. Komansky said he hoped that there would not be further job cuts down the road. **********Some Merrill Lynch employees are angry that the firm is making deep job cuts so soon after it put up $300 million to help rescue Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund. A deferred compensation plan for Merrill Lynch's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, has money invested in the fund. ''I can understand people who are being downsized and laid off feeling that kind of thing,'' Mr. Komansky said. ''It's something I feel terrible about. It's not something that's easy, but it's about managing your cost base to maintain profitability.'' **********At the World Financial Center in Manhattan, where Merrill has its headquarters, employees seemed glum but resigned to the cuts. ''It's just the normal ups and downs of the market,'' said a worker who would not give his name. ''Sometimes these things happen, you know?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-400904.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Conxus Communications Inc., Greenville, S.C., to FGI Inc., Chapel Hill, N.C., as the first agency to handle strategic marketing and advertising.

This was cool. Mayra and Lucas were more patient than my previous teacher.'' **********Mayra and Lucas are among the dozens of teen-agers and community leaders who have benefited from the U S West Foundation's new Technology Academy. One of several programs using children as teachers, the U S West program is intended to spread the word in even the poorest communities that kids, with their uninhibited curiosity and wealth of time to fiddle and explore, may very well be the nation's most natural technicians and teachers of technology. **********Across the nation, from Washington to Minnesota and South Dakota to Connecticut, new programs are using young computer whizzes as computer-maintenance technicians, troubleshooters and one-on-one tutors for fellow students, teachers and even school principals. **********''In a time when technology specialists are increasingly in demand, schools, through desperation and happenstance, are discovering that kids are incredibly adept at learning and using technology and, with very little additional training, often make the best teachers of technology,'' said Lin Foa, an educational consultant based in Potomac, Md., who is coordinator of the Technology Academy. ''In a true community of learners, kids are much more motivated when they finally have been given a task and see that they can also contribute.'' **********Training children to teach teachers how to infuse technology into the educational process has also been a success in the Olympia, Wash., public schools. Dennis Harper directs a program called Generation Why: Worldwide Horizons for Youth. With a five-year grant from the United States Department of Education, the Washington State Department of Education and such corporate sponsors as Microsoft, Generation Why gives students computer training (kids.osd.wednet.edu/genwhy/index.html) so they can serve as technology mentors for their teachers. **********First tested in the Olympia schools, this model has now spread not only throughout Washington State but also to Philadelphia, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Washington and the Virgin Islands. ''The kids are nerds, are geeks, whatever,'' Dr. Harper said, ''but they are great at keyboarding and word processing. The kids know a lot about technology. The teachers know the pedagogy. So we put them together.'' **********Last month the U S West Technology Academy held its third training session. Based in Denver, U S West provides telecommunications services to 25 million customers in 14 states in the West and Midwest. **********In 1997, the U S West Foundation began WOW: Widening Our World, Community Technology Networks, a program to provide needy communities with computers and computer training. The program's Web site (www.uswf.org/academy) has helpful hints like, ''Adults have an attention span of 20 minutes,'' and, ''Always be polite to adults. After all, they will respect you if you are a GOOD TEACHER.'' Of 148 proposals from schools and community groups throughout the 14 states that U S West services, 70 community groups representing low-income, rural and minority populations were selected for programs in which children teach adults, and one another, how to use computers and the Internet. **********In January, February and March, the U S West Technology Academy held four-day training sessions in Englewood, Colo., for the 70 teams and then sent each of them back to their communities with a computer server, four desktop computers and $15,000 to initiate local programs training and incorporating kids into computer education. Classes included instruction on setting up and maintaining a computer network and doing Internet research, Web publishing, peer coaching and marketing. Teams from as far afield as Apache Junction, Ariz., and Independence, Ore., were made up of two adults and two students, ideally 13 or older, said Jane J. Prancan, executive director of the U S West Foundation. **********There were two 9-year-olds and two children whose primary language was Spanish at the first Technology Academy in January. ''The kids were getting a little lost with certain terminology,'' Ms. Prancan said.  For instance, they didn't understand what 'gender-neutral passwords' meant.'' **********Most of the community projects accepted into the U S West Technology Academy were designed to reach out to poor or rural areas. Dr. Foa said: ''The whole point was to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots. We are trying to point out to these teams that they are to serve as ambassadors and spread their new knowledge. The constant message is that this is just the beginning.'' **********Row upon row of computer networks were set up in several ballrooms at the Marriott Hotel. Boys in baseball caps were seated beside men with graying hair. In dreadlocks and thin gold-rimmed spectacles, 12-year-old Adam Davis had come from Golden Valley, Minn., to learn how to hook up the computer and create Web pages so he could go back home and ''lend a hand.'' **********Jesse Schonau-Taylor, a junior at Newport High School in Newport, Ore., participated in the February training session and has already been spreading his new knowledge at both his high school's computer lab and at the Ocean Spray Low-Income Housing Center. **********''It is a very different experience to teach adults,'' he said. ''Teen-agers are very active. For adults, you have to slow down. You have to be very patient. You always have to be pleasant and smiling, and it's better not to use slang.'' **********Then Jesse told a story about helping a woman find a job. ''She was a maid,'' he said, ''and she thought all she ever could be was a maid. She had a really negative attitude about life. But by teaching people about the computer, we can help them find jobs. A couple of weeks later, I noticed that she was dressed nicer and nicer, even in a business suit. She was re-evaluating her life.'' **********Jesse paused.

Whenever lenders go from tough guys to E-Z Credit ''R'' Us, loan losses are almost inevitable. **********With the economy perking, lenders are the life of the party. ''Banks always manage for the up part of the cycle, not the whole cycle,'' said Charles Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York. **********Bank-stock bulls seem to think the industry is no longer cyclical. As a result, shares are trading at historic premiums to book value. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange bank index -- composed of 24 of the nation's largest money center and regional banks -- is up 16 percent this year. Over the last twelve months, the index has gained 33 percent, beating the 27 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But a letter that the Federal Reserve Board sent to the nation's commercial banks last month indicates that in this regard, at least, the Fed is not ready to toss traditional standards into history's ashcan. **********The letter, written by Richard Spillenkothen, director of banking supervision, isn't alarmist. But because it details the results of an extensive Fed review of bank asset quality and credit standards, it makes surprisingly interesting reading. **********In comparing loans made in 1995 with those made last year, the Fed found that intense competition for loan customers had led to a significant relaxation of lending standards. That hasn't resulted in ugly problems, the Fed said, because of the robust economy -- a caveat made more pointed by reports last week that manufacturing activity had slowed in June for the first time in almost two years. **********Indeed, ugly may come sooner, not later, if some of the lending practices identified by the Fed are commonplace. Only 20 to 30 percent of the several hundred loans reviewed showed any attempt by lenders to project how a borrower might perform in an economic downturn. In nearly half the loans, approval documents did not describe key financial covenants -- thresholds in financial performance that a borrower must meet -- that might lead to protective action by a bank before a loan goes belly-up. ''Management may be inadequately informed as to the risks'' associated with loans, the Fed wrote. Another concern was the rapid growth in loans to real estate investment trusts. Although these loans are now sound, the Fed warned that they might represent concentrated credit risk at banks. **********Singling out REIT's, Mr. Peabody said, may be a concession to Fed members worried that rocketing real estate prices are one of the wealth effects of an overheated stock market. He thinks a schism may be developing inside the Fed. In May's Open Market Committee meeting, William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, and Jerry Jordan, president of the Cleveland bank, dissented from the decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Arguing for a tighter monetary policy, Mr. Jordan cited asset price inflation as a main concern. **********Mr. Peabody finds this intriguing, because schisms within the Fed are unusual. There was a similar divergence on policy between regional Fed banks and their Washington counterparts in 1928. The regional members wanted to raise rates, Washington did not. **********The split made headlines in March 1929, giving a jolt to stock prices.

They are believed to have left behind plenty of evidence of citizens' spying on their fellow citizens during the more than two-decade rule of Nicolae Ceausescu. **********The author of the draft legislation is Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, a member of the Senate who was jailed for 11 years by the Communists for his role as a member of the opposition National Peasants' Party. He wants people to have wide-ranging access to the files. Mr. Dumitrescu has said that in order to know who is who in today's society, people should be able to examine any file they want. **********But others in the Peasants' Party, which forms the core of the Government of Prime Minister Viktor Ciorbea, believe that in order to prevent public recriminations, individuals should be allowed to look only at their own files. That is the basic premise of the system established for access to the secret police files in East Germany soon after the fall of the Berlin wall. **********For the first seven years after the end of the Ceausescu Government, former Communists were in power in Romania, and many leading figures of that Government had been members of the Securitate. **********They blocked the opening of the files and in some cases appear to have helped tamper with the files or destroy them. A substantial cache of secret police files was found dumped in the countryside in the early 1990's. **********Manuela Stefanescu, a lawyer who is co-chairman of the Helsinki Committee in Romania, a human rights group, said many of the files had been tampered with since 1989 to protect or destroy reputations. Thus, it would be reckless, she said, to allow the wholesale opening of the files that Mr. Dumitrescu proposes. Such a move could lead to false accusations against innocent people, she said. **********It is important, Ms. Stefanescu said, that access be given so that individuals can examine their own dossiers -- but not those of others. The files of candidates running for office also should be made public so voters can assess their past, she said. **********Even before legislation is passed, some dissidents have persisted in trying to get access to their files. So far, they have been given only glimpses. **********Gabriel Andrescu, a member of the Helsinki Committee who was imprisoned under the Ceausescu Government, saw his files in 1996 after years of seeking them from the military prosecutor's office. But when they were presented to him, they appeared to have been thinned out. **********In another case, a mayoral candidate in 1996 for one of Romania's provincial capitals announced that he had served as an informant for the Securitate under Communism.

The church is still a powerful political constituency in Italy, and it does not intend to be left out of the horse-trading. **********''It took a Socialist Government in Italy to make a concordat with the church,'' Vittorio Messori, a Catholic writer who interviewed Pope John Paul II in the book ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' said, referring to the 1984 concordat that abolished Catholicism as the state religion, on terms that many view as favorable to the church.

The church has been lobbying heavily for the Government to give more state financing to private Catholic schools. **********Mr. D'Alema, moreover, seems anxious not to alienate the Catholic Church. Asked at a news conference tonight if he intended to use a scheduled meeting with the Pope on Tuesday to clarify his relationship with the church, he evenly replied, ''I have no quarrel with the Holy Father, so I have nothing to clarify.'' **********The church, which helped keep the Christian Democrats in power for more than 50 years, adopted a more flexible approach to politics in 1992. By then, the Berlin wall had fallen, and so had the Christian Democratic Party, which collapsed under the weight of corruption scandals. **********During the 1996 elections, which brought Mr. Prodi to power, Vatican officials said the church would not endorse a particular party. Now, with the prospect of Mr. D'Alema, Mr. Messori said many Catholics were counting on a pragmatic strategy by the church: ''As Machiavelli said, if you want to further your own aims, put your enemies in power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/03/business/worldbusiness/IHT-world-bank-official-is-upbeat-on-global-impact-of.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1998-02-03", "snippet": "The impact of the East Asian financial crisis on the rest of the world now looks as if it will be rather benign, with unanticipated beneficial effects virtually balancing the bad, a senior World Bank official said here Monday..This revised upbeat ...", "word_count": 2346, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Bank Official Is Upbeat On Global Impact of Asia Crisis", "print_headline": "World Bank Official Is Upbeat On Global Impact of Asia Crisis", "body_text": " **********The impact of the East Asian financial crisis on the rest of the world now looks as if it will be rather benign, with unanticipated beneficial effects virtually balancing the bad, a senior World Bank official said here Monday. **********This revised upbeat analysis rests on three critical assumptions, Pieter Bottelier, a senior adviser at the bank, told a press seminar: that the Asian financial crisis has bottomed and will not worsen; that growth in Japan will not slow further than the limp 1 percent now forecast for 1998, and that the United States will temporarily put up with a widening trade deficit. **********Under these conditions, Mr. Bottelier said, the World Bank sees falling interest rates and sharply improved terms of trade benefiting the industrialized countries.

Yet media executives and consultants say profitability in China is so far in the future that no one can predict when it will come. **********Mr. Murdoch has put well over $1 billion into a satellite television network called Star TV, which broadcasts in several Asian countries and is intended to be the News Corporation's route into China, where more than 300 million homes have television sets, the world's largest potential market. **********But winning approval to broadcast, collecting subscription fees selling advertising are proving so difficult that media executives measure progress in tiny increments. China's entertainment industry is coming alive, yet business opportunities remain maddeningly elusive to foreign operations. **********News Corporation executives argue that they are taking the long view and that with a small toe in the door, they are ahead of their competitors. ''It's all about position, position, position,'' said Bruce Dover, the company's chief representative in Beijing. ''Our strategy is to be ready for the day when the door opens.'' **********Mr. Dover pointed to Star TV's partial ownership of a Hong Kong company, the Phoenix Satellite Television Company, as an important if modest sign of progress. The Phoenix channel, with Chinese-language programming, broadcasts decidely cheerful dramatic shows that consultants say will have difficulty winning cable viewers with 40 channels to choose from. **********Limited mostly to viewers in international hotels and to a cable network in a single Chinese city, Guangzhou, Phoenix reaches a tiny segment of China's viewers. Star TV claims that 35 million homes have access to Phoenix, though independent consultants say that is probably optimistic. **********Even worse, Phoenix broadcasts are still technically illegal, since the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television has yet to grant formal approval. Officials are clearly aware of Phoenix's broadcasts, and they are essentially reserving the right to block them at any time. The same is true for Star TV's four channels, which carry music videos, sports, movies and English programs. **********The brightest aspect of Phoenix, consultants say, is that Star TV shares ownership with a Singapore company called Today's Asia and a Hong Kong company called China Wise, which have their own connections to China's television industry. Star TV and Today's Asia each own 45 percent; China Wise owns the remaining 10 percent. **********''China is so tightly controlled that a joint venture like that is quite an achievement,'' said John Wong, of the Boston Consulting Group, who advises media companies in China. **********Mr. Dover said Star TV, which Mr. Murdoch bought for $900 million in 1993, had lost perhaps $100 million a year until last year, when its loss was reduced to $40 million. It will break even in 12 to 18 months, he estimated. **********Advertising revenue for Phoenix, Mr. Dover said, grew to $34 million last year. ''We're quite happy with that,'' he said. **********Although Mr. Murdoch has visited China many times, assiduously courting Chinese leaders, he attracted the most notice here in 1993 when he said in a speech in London that technological advances like satellite TV were ''an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.'' **********Alarmed, China's leadership promptly banned individuals from buying satellite dishes. **********Mr. Murdoch's efforts to repair ties to Beijing -- by yanking the BBC news service from Star TV's broadcasts, by authorizing a $1 million book contract at HarperCollins for the daughter of Deng Xiaoping, and by reaching a minor Internet deal with The People's Daily -- have yet to win back much encouragement. **********The News Corporation's only other China venture, a television studio in Tianjin, has also been a disappointment, a Star TV executive said. ''It's a waiting game,'' the executive conceded, referring to Mr. Murdoch's plans in China. ''He realizes it's going to be be a long, long trip.'' **********Mr. Dover, the News Corporation executive, said: ''That problem of control still worries them. But there's an insatiable appetite they have to meet. They need to be more forward-looking.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/business/media-business-advertising-real-winners-electronic-commerce-are-turning-be.html": {"writer_name": "Bob Tedeschi", "pub_date": "1998-12-15", "snippet": "Credit-card companies have appeared to awaken to reality that second only to plastic, the Internet is best thing that ever happened to the industry; at end of November, typical E-commerce site can send up to 2.5 percent of its revenue to credit-ca...", "word_count": 1219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The real winners in electronic commerce are turning out to be the credit-card companies.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; The real winners in electronic commerce are turning out to be the credit-card companies.", "body_text": " **********IN many an Internet start-up company's dreams, there's a fragment of hope that its Web site, device or software will somehow stand at the tollbooth of the electronic commerce universe and collect a share of every transaction made in cyberspace. **********That device has already arrived. It's called the credit card. **********In recent weeks, credit-card companies have appeared to awaken to the reality that second only to plastic, the Internet is the best thing that ever happened to the industry. Thus this season has seen the television advertising campaign for Visa and the Internet toy merchant Etoys, Seagram's Universal Studios on-line promotion with the Morgan Stanley  Dean Witter Discover card, and last week's deal between the Internet service provider Earth Link Network and the credit-card monolith MBNA Corporation, which issues Visa and Mastercard cards. **********If the purveyors of revolving debt suddenly look like the Internet's latest, best pal, there's good reason. Most of the deals were conceived months ago, when it became clear that electronic commerce meant a no-cash, no-check bazaar where consumers would use their cards more than ever. **********''I've been running around the office rallying the troops, saying 'We've been waiting 40 years for an opportunity like this,' '' said Joseph Vause, vice president of electronic commerce for Visa USA. **********As the E-commerce pie expands, so, too, grows the wealth of the credit-card industry. At month's end, a typical E-commerce site can send up to 2.5 percent of its revenue to the credit-card companies to cover transaction fees. Given estimated Internet sales of roughly $40 billion this year, credit-card companies expect to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in transaction fees. **********And, of course, that number is expected to skyrocket as an ever-greater percentage of consumers turn to on-line shopping. Visa, for one, estimates that it will process a total of $13 billion in Internet charges this year, or about 1 percent of its total charge activity. But by 2003, those umbers are expected to reach $100 billion and 11 percent, respectively. **********Given the math, ''credit-card companies are going to find that the investments they've made are very wise ones indeed,'' said Ken Cassar, an E-commerce analyst at the New York Internet research firm of Jupiter Communications. Noting that consumers now make 80 percent of purchases with cash, Mr. Cassar said, ''If credit-card companies can move that number 5 percent'' via on-line purchases, ''that's huge.'' **********So far, analysts say, the credit- card company doing the most to promote Internet spending is Visa, which holds the biggest market share on line and off. While Visa USA, the umbrella organization for the 21,000 financial institutions that issue the card, was already one of the leading on-line advertisers in 1997, it has taken the message to the mainstream in 1998 with the Etoys holiday promotion on television. **********The $8 million to $10 million ad campaign, for which Etoys paid nothing, has done so well that Etoys canceled its own ad campaigns lest it be overwhelmed by demand, Visa's Mr. Vause said. He added, ''It's the first time we could feature a merchant everybody could go to.'' **********But even the organization's $25 million 1998 advertising budget pales in comparison with what is being spent by some of the Visa-affiliated financial institutions. In late October, for instance, First USA, a Visa and Mastercard issuer, announced a five-year, $90 million deal to advertise its credit cards on Microsoft's MSN.com site -- and that was just one of several marketing deals it has made with major Web sites. **********Mastercard was actually the first to bring the topic of Internet spending into prime time, with an ad that was on the ''Seinfeld'' finale in May promoting Excite's shopping channel. Mastercard has also spent heavily on its Shop Smart program, in which it endorses Internet retailers, and it is about to start another Internet-oriented television ad. **********The Discover card, meanwhile, is capitalizing on shoppers who make on-line purchases only when they find bargains. At Discover's Shop Center, consumers get rebates and discounts from selected merchants when they buy with the card. **********Curiously, analysts say that American Express has been relatively less active on line, which Mr. Cassar of Jupiter Communications characterized as ''a huge, colossal mistake.'' **********''It's just a ton of potential opportunity that Amex will basically be giving up to other credit-card associations,'' Mr. Cassar said. **********Emily Porter, director for public affairs at American Express, said the company ''is doing special offers on line'' -- promoting last-minute travel bargains on its site, for example. However, its mass media Web commerce promotion has been limited to a recent one-day radio media tour that she conducted, ''where on-line shopping was talked about in practically every interview, so we are seeking to spread the word.'' **********Perhaps not enough. According to a recent Jupiter survey of consumers who used credit cards to make Web purchases this year, 55 percent used Visa, 26 percent used Mastercard, and 11 percent used American Express. Off line, American Express has 16.7 percent of the market, according to Credit Card Management magazine, while Mastercard has 27.4 percent and Visa 48 percent. **********For Web merchants, having the credit-card companies' support is a boon. While off-line ads promote the medium, on-line advertising dollars help rich sites get richer, proven sites get rich and start-ups get by. **********Preview Travel, which earns 25 percent of its revenue from banners that advertisers buy on its Web site, struck its biggest ad deal this summer with Mastercard, which paid an undisclosed amount for the right to be the ''preferred'' card at the site. For that, Mastercard gets its logo placed throughout the site -- but in no location more important than at the point where the customer selects a credit card to book a reservation. Moreover, while the order form's selection box includes other credit cards, only Mastercard is highlighted. **********''That's the trick of the game,'' said Paul Johnson, an on-line commerce analyst with the International Data Corporation, an Internet research firm in Framingham, Mass. ''I'm anxious to see how successful that is.'' **********Mastercard says its Internet partnerships are quite successful. ''We've seen market-share shifts of 30 percent with some sites,'' said Debra Coughlin, senior vice president of global advertising for Mastercard International. **********Ad dollars notwithstanding, not all sites are convinced of the value of such partnerships. **********''We get a lot of offers, but nobody's come up with a compelling enough reason for us to offer this to our customers,'' said Robert Olson, chief operating officer of Virtual Vineyards, a wine retailer. **********Meanwhile, Fingerhut, a catalogue  company and Web retailer with more than $1.5 billion in annual sales and its own proprietary credit card, is trying to circumvent the credit- card companies altogether. Andy Johnson, Fingerhut's senior vice president for market development, said that starting next year the company would begin issuing proprietary credit cards for its E-commerce sites, like Andy's Garage, just as Macy's does with its in-house credit cards. **********''We're looking for ways to take costs out of the process,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Right now, customers are paying for the fees the credit-card companies charge us.'' **********Ultimately, it may not matter which credit-card company gets the customer's money. What matters is that the emerging symbiotic relationship between silicon chips and plastic cards is nurturing electronic commerce and bringing consumers a step closer the day when cash is no longer king."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/01/business/refinancing-watch-steady-and-waiting-for-the-fed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-11-01", "snippet": "Mortgage rates, after monthlong volatility, settle down; lenders predict no sharp moves until Federal Reserve policy meeting in mid-November (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steady and Waiting for the Fed", "print_headline": "REFINANCING WATCH; Steady and Waiting for the Fed", "body_text": " **********After a month of wide movements, mortgage rates settled down last week.

There are centrifuges, reactors, pumps, hundreds of acres of buildings and soil, all bearing troublesome radioactive memories of the roles they played in building nuclear bombs. **********BNFL Inc. looks at the same stuff and sees $50 million worth of metals it can sell as scrap. The East Tennessee Materials and Energy Corporation sees a place to set up a waste-treatment center without fouling anyone's back yard. Blue Ridge Development sees a place where it can set up shop at a dirt-cheap rent. Bioneutrics Inc. sees a way to treat brain cancer. **********''It seemed a crime to bury something that could be used for a purpose like this,'' said George F. Dilworth, president of Bioneutrics, which is building a cancer treatment center around a small nuclear reactor that the Government estimates would cost $8.5 million to dismantle, decontaminate and bury. **********Apparently, lots of people agree. The disparate visions of Oak Ridge are melding, as a growing reindustrialization program lets companies clean up financially by cleaning up Oak Ridge. **********Although each arrangement is different, in essence companies like Bioneutrics are bartering their services in return for materials or space. Typically, the companies agree to decontaminate a specified portion of Oak Ridge. They return cleaned-up classified equipment to the Energy Department for disposal. But they get to keep the nonclassified materials and equipment on their site, and they get to occupy the space at a deeply discounted rent. **********''This program has moved up the decontamination and re-use of these buildings by at least two generations,'' said Robert Brown, Oak Ridge's operations asset manager. **********It is also saving the Government hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs and creating jobs in an area that seemed poised for economic devastation. **********Not that everyone is delighted. The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, which represents many Oak Ridge workers, has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to force companies to give its laid-off workers first crack at new jobs. And while environmental officials in Washington say they have not paid close attention to the project, Environmental Protection Agency officials in Atlanta have expressed worries that the Energy Department will divert funds from cleanup to marketing. **********Still, advocates seem to far outnumber critics. ''It's win-win all around,'' said Joe W. Anderson, chairman of East Tennessee Materials. The company is cleaning up and re-using some 85,000 square feet of space, at a $2 million saving to the Energy Department, and is employing some 200 displaced Oak Ridge workers to boot. ''The community gets jobs, the D.O.E. gets free cleanup, we get to resell whatever material we can salvage, and we get a place to set up shop,'' Mr. Anderson said. **********If Oak Ridge were a private facility, industry would probably run the other way. It is a quintessential ''brownfields'' property -- land or buildings with a legacy of hazardous contamination. Companies often shy away from such facilities, fearing they will be held liable if the actual culprit in the contamination goes out of business, or otherwise escapes culpability for future harm. **********Those are unlikely scenarios at Oak Ridge, a vast complex that was carved out of farmland during World War II, provided enriched uranium for the first atom bomb, and turned out components for nuclear weapons for years afterward. ''The isotopes we used are unique to us, and there's no way 20 years from now that we could or would shift responsibility to anyone else,'' Mr. Brown said. **********Oak Ridge probably could not afford to clean up on its own. Its budget, $3.2 billion in 1993, is now $1.9 billion and falling. The work force, 19,300 strong in 1993, is down to 14,500, and heading for no more than 7,500 within a few years. And Oak Ridge faces a domino effect: less money means fewer people means more shuttered facilities means more idle plants in need of cleaning up. **********Other Energy Department weapons plants face similar budget cuts. Those that must remain open -- Sandia, in Santa Fe, N.M., which must maintain existing weapons stockpiles, is a notable example -- are bringing in extra money by letting companies use their people and facilities for industrial research. Those with particularly severe contamination -- like Rocky Flats, near Denver -- are cleaning up and shutting down. And a few facilities are experimenting with what Robert W. DeGrasse Jr., an Energy Department director, calls ''the perpetual motion approach'' -- they clean up some space, lease it out, and use the lease revenue to clean up other space. **********But only Oak Ridge seems suited to a huge clean-it-and-keep-it approach. The gaseous diffusion process that it used to enrich uranium yields a lot of residual nickel, which has a high value on the scrap metal market. And uranium presents a less formidable health hazard and decontamination problem than do plutonium, tritium or other elements used in weapons. **********''Sometimes, you can decontaminate an entire machine with simple solvent, hand-wipe, and good old elbow grease,'' said Joel W. Garber, vice president of American Technologies Inc., a $20 million engineering services company that is decontaminating 125,000 square feet and 200 machines at Oak Ridge. **********In many ways, Oak Ridge is wiping away its history with similar ease. It recently changed the name of its old K-25 uranium enrichment facility, a 706-acre complex with 118 buildings, to the East Tennessee Technology Park. Its goal is to turn it into a self-sustaining industrial park by 2010. **********The first lease was signed in May 1996, and 45 percent of the space is already in the hands of the private sector. One reason for the speed: with Congress's blessing, Oak Ridge circumvented the mountains of red tape that would normally accompany any industry-government deal by handling all transactions through the Community Re-use Organization of East Tennessee, or Croet, a nonprofit private-sector group set up expressly as Oak Ridge's real estate marketing arm. **********''It would take the D.O.E. two years to do what we can do in a few months,'' said Lawrence Young, president of Croet (pronounced CROW-ette). **********Start-up companies can get going even more quickly. Blue Ridge Development, a local real estate developer, has taken 54,000 square feet of already clean space, and is subdividing it to use as an incubator for fledgling companies. **********Dan Barnett, a Blue Ridge partner, says the leases can be approved in weeks. ''Someone who just needs a few hundred square feet doesn't want to wait for all kinds of negotiations and approvals,'' he said. ''Let's face it, the private sector just knows how to move quicker.'' **********In lieu of cleanup responsibilities, Blue Ridge gave Croet a check for $250,000 in advance rent. It will also share some of its rental revenues with Croet after two years. **********Oak Ridge is not by any means getting away scot-free on its cleanup bill. In by far the biggest contract signed so far, it has agreed to pay BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., $238 million over six years to clean up three contaminated buildings, comprising five million square feet of floor space. **********BNFL, which has dismantled gaseous diffusion plants in England -- and which, in fact, has been decontaminating waste for commercial nuclear plants in the United States for three years -- calculates that there are at least 130,000 tons of copper, nickel and other metals it can salvage. It also figures it can resell a few electrical transformers and other pieces of equipment, particularly in developing countries. **********John R. Smith, senior vice president of BNFL, which is based in Fairfax, Va., estimates that the company can get $50 million for the cleaned-up materials, bringing its total take to $288 million. That's about a quarter of what the Energy Department estimates it would cost to do the cleanup itself -- but then, Mr. Smith notes, that estimate builds in the cost of government bureaucracy and inefficiency. **********''Their mind-set is making weapons, not decommissioning them,'' he said. ''We have the experience, and at $288 million we can make a modest, sensible profit.'' **********BNFL will hire some 300 former Oak Ridge workers to help with the cleanup and will turn the decontaminated space back to Croet to lease to companies without cleanup skills. That, in turn, will create a rental revenue stream that Croet can use to pay for even more cleanup. **********While BNFL is plumbing the lion's share of metallic riches, smaller companies are being dazzled as well. American Technologies originally leased some 45,000 square feet in a relatively uncontaminated maintenance shop at Oak Ridge, with the idea of turning decontaminated metal scrap into containers for low-level radioactive waste. But soon after it moved in, it realized that the huge machine tool shop next door presented more lucrative opportunities. **********So it stopped fabricating boxes -- ''We realized we couldn't compete in price with cold rolled steel anyway,'' Mr. Garber recalled -- and agreed to decontaminate the whole area. In return, it will pocket anything it gets for the tools. The Energy Department estimates that the equipment is worth as much as $1.5 million, and Mr. Garber, who has arranged to auction it off in June, says he can get even more. **********Already, the new Oak Ridge tenants are learning to use one another to maximize their profits. BNFL and American Technologies are joining forces to look for used-equipment markets in Southeast Asia. And Materials and Chemistry Laboratory Inc., an environmental testing company, is looking for a partner to help it clean up an underused Oak Ridge laboratory that it wants to use. The company wants no part of cleanup responsibilities, so it is looking to barter free laboratory testing services to a company that will do the cleanup. **********''We'd pay maybe $2.35 for space that's worth $5 or $6 a square foot, so trading for the cleanup gives us a real bargain,'' said Barry A. Stephenson, the company's president. **********Such side deals are just fine with Oak Ridge and Croet. Indeed, anything that gets Oak Ridge cleaned up more quickly sits well with them. Croet just leased clean space to Dynamic Tooling Systems, a tool-and-die company that will employ 30 local people, but that did not want to clean space itself. And Mr. Young is planning to build a conventional industrial park on 1,000 acres of uncontaminated farmland nearby. **********''This area needs jobs,'' Mr. Young said. ''And cleanup and jobs are inextricably linked.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/business/there-s-steady-rush-corporate-altar-mergers-acquisitions-continue-record-pace.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-03-04", "snippet": "Corporate mergers and acquisitions continue at record pace across-the-board; Securities Data Co says so far this year, financial services industry--including banks, investment firms and insurance companies--is leading mergers pack with 119 announc...", "word_count": 1819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "There's a Steady Rush To the Corporate Altar; Mergers and Acquisitions Continue At a Record Pace Across-the-Board", "print_headline": "There's a Steady Rush To the Corporate Altar; Mergers and Acquisitions Continue At a Record Pace Across-the-Board", "body_text": " **********It is early morning on a recent Tuesday, and Gary Parr is hard at work.

Telecommunications companies are not far behind, with 31 proposed transactions valued at $23.5 billion, followed by the business-services sector, where a $8.4 billion hostile bid by Computer Associates for the Computer Sciences Corporation drove the total up to $13.5 billion. **********Similarly, the Halliburton Company's agreement last week to acquire Dresser Industries for $7.7 billion skewed the figures for the machinery industry, thrusting it to No. 4,  even though machinery is not expected to be hot this year. **********But there is plenty of business for everyone; over all, 1998 is shaping up as the most hectic mergers-and-acquisition season on record, and the momentum seems unstoppable. **********Through Feb. 26, 1,506 domestic transactions valued at $142.2 billion have been announced, according to Securities Data, surpassing the previous record of 1,548 deals worth $128 billion in the similar period last year. And volume for all of 1997 set a record for the fourth year in a row. ''The merger train is still on track and gaining speed,'' said Richard Peterson, a spokesman for Securities Data. **********Think back to last October when the stock market dropped 1,017 points, or 12.4 percent, in less than three weeks. Bankers lamented then that the good old days were over and that it was time to find a ''real'' job. **********They were wrong. Many analysts now predict the mergers boom will continue no matter what the stock market does. They look at all the elements of the global market -- financial deregulation at home, the crisis in Asia, market liberalization in Europe and, everywhere, low interest rates and inflation -- and conclude more companies will decide the only way to prosper in such an environment is to become bigger fast by joining forces with a competitor. **********''There is pressure on younger companies to keep up with the giants,'' said Eff Martin, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs's high-technology group. ''They have to have the critical mass to compete.'' **********Plus, you cannot forget the strong economy. With stock prices so high, some chief excutives figure that now is a good time to sell. Acquisition-minded companies do not mind paying a premium because a good partner will give earnings a boost. But some studies suggest that while initial enthusiasm raises a stock's price, mergers only sporadically deliver as promised in the long run. **********Still everywhere, activist investors like the mutual-fund manager Michael Price are badgering poor performers to cut costs and improve profits. ''That pressure will force companies to pursue strategies to keep the price of their stock up,'' said Rick Escherich, an analyst in the mergers-and-acquisitions department of J. P. Morgan Securities. **********The danger, of course, is that investors' expectations will be raised to unrealistic levels. Only last month, Donald J. Trump caught many people on Wall Street off guard by hiring two investment banks to help him sell some or all of his debt-laden Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts for what they viewed as a far-fetched price of $1.1 billion, or about $29 a share -- almost triple its current market price. **********Even a market crash would probably do little to cure merger fever, industry watchers say. If the Dow tumbles, says Robert Friedman, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, ''acquisition targets will look a lot more attractive to leveraged buyout firms.'' Buyout firms have been stockpiling cash and are set to pounce on vulnerable companies.  Witness Texas Pacific Group's injecting $350 million, for instance, to help bail out battered Oxford Health Plans when the health care giant's stock fell to the midteens. **********Another twist investors can expect is an increase in the number of deals abroad. Last year, 45 percent of the $1.58 trillion of worldwide mergers and acquisitions were outside North America, according to J. P. Morgan. And this year, Europe is expected to be even livelier, in part because of the privatization of government-owned concerns and the deregulation of telecommunications and financial institutions. Recently, for example, Allianz, the German insurer, announced a bid to acquire AGF, a French rival, for more than $10 billion. If completed, it would be the largest-ever foreign takeover of a French company. **********And once the smoke from Asia's financial crisis starts to clear, two trends are likely to emerge. Already, cash-poor Asian companies are seeking buyers for subsidiaries to raise money quickly. And American companies that want a presence in Japan or South Korea will finally be able to buy it. ''For the first time, you can afford to raid a Korean company,'' said Steven Koch, a co-head of the mergers group at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Two months ago, you couldn't do that.'' **********In the United States, investors can expect consolidation in the financial sector to lead the merger wave. ''You have a blurring of the lines between banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial services,'' said Ken Wilson, head of the financial-institutions group at Lazard Freres. Banks are selling for three to five times stated book value -- the worth of a company's assets at their original acquisition prices minus any depreciation. That is the highest level since they rebounded from their early slump of the 1990's. **********Why are suitors willing to pay so much? Economy of scale is a big factor; the most successful mergers are expected to slash costs by 25 to 55 percent. But the main impetus is that size is seen as a key to survival. Banks want to solidify their presence at home and expand into new markets. Nationsbank, the fast-growing banking conglomerate based in Charlotte, N.C., for example, lacks a large presence in California. It has long desired to complete a transaction with BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, but it is interested in First Chicago NBD, too, bank advisers say. **********Investment banks that are rumored to be on the block include J. P. Morgan, which has transformed itself from a commercial bank, and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, a unit of Deutsche Bank. Both have underperformed their rivals. **********One fly in the ointment is the year 2000 software problem, which some analysts say could slow bank merger activity next year if it is not overcome soon. **********In insurance, the consolidation of the overcrowded life insurance business is fueling the boom. The United States has more than 100 active life insurance groups, according to Michael Blumstein, a Morgan Stanley analyst. ''Compare that to Japan, which has about 30,'' he said. Aetna, for example, has reportedly put its life insurance unit up for sale even as it seeks to develop a bigger health insurance business. **********For sellers like Aetna, the timing is right. Insurance companies in general are now selling for between two and two and a half times stated book value, the highest in recent memory. Unlike banks, though, insurance companies will expand more rapidly abroad, said Rodgin Cohen, an lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, one of the leading law firms in mergers and acquisitions. Bankers speculate that smaller insurance companies, like Life USA Holdings or ARM Financial Group, could be targets. **********And the decision of more and more mutual insurance companies to go public could set off another wave of activity, analysts say. **********Pharmaceutical companies are playing the mating game, too, but for different reasons. Unlike insurers or banks, said Jay Flaherty, head of Merrill Lynch's global health care group, they ''don't have the external pressure to do something because they are in pretty good shape.'' **********Their goal is to combine their research and development to come up with new products more cheaply and only in rare cases to shore up a balance sheet or replenish a drug pipeline. Analysts say American Home Products, which was dropped in January by SmithKline Beecham, is on the prowl for a partner, as is SmithKline, which last week broke off talks with Glaxo Wellcome and is rumored to be a hostile target. **********Patrick McMullan of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette warns that if the stock market declines the next few months, small biotechnology companies that are looking for capital could find themselves in the arms of larger companies -- either through alliances or outright acquisitions. **********Telecommunications and computer companies are among the most widely discussed candidates. Analysts expect regional telephone companies to expand into new markets and computer concerns to buy networking or Internet companies to round out their product lines. **********Utilities are the latest industry caught up in deregulation. Gregg Polle, a banker at Salomon Smith Barney who specializes in the sector, said merger activity was happening at two levels. ''Some companies say the way to make money is to become retail companies and offer a suite of products,'' he said. ''Others say the way to make money is to deliver electricity to the house.'' **********Companies near each other will be the quickest to marry. Candidates include FPL Group in Juno Beach, Fla., the Southern Company in Atlanta and Dominion Resources in Richmond. **********One obstacle is that regulators have not figured out how far deregulation should go. American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, and the Central and South West Corporation of Dallas announced their intention to combine last December, but the transaction is being reviewed by regulators. **********''If regulators let the deal go through, it will open up more activity,'' Mr. Polle said. ''If they knock it down, mergers could slow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/07/business/company-reports-markets-market-place-motorola-issues-some-relatively-good-then.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1998-04-07", "snippet": "Motorola Inc reports that it has managed to match Wall Street's diminished expectations for its first-quarter earnings, but any likelihood that investors in technology companies will take that as good news is dashed when company warns that its sec...", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS: THE MARKETS -- Market Place; Motorola issues some relatively good news, then some bad.", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS: THE MARKETS -- Market Place; Motorola issues some relatively good news, then some bad.", "body_text": " **********MOTOROLA Inc. reported late yesterday that it had managed to match Wall Street's diminished expectations for its first-quarter earnings, but any likelihood that investors in technology companies would take that as good news was dashed when the company warned that its second quarter was shaping up much more poorly than projected. **********''This doesn't look good,'' said John Lazlo, who follows technology stocks for Paine Webber in San Francisco. ''Most people felt that the first quarter would be the trough.'' **********Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., said that it earned $180 million, or 30 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the first quarter, down 45 percent from $325 million, or 53 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were $6.9 billion, up 4 percent from a year earlier. **********Excluding $54 million from asset sales and other one-time gains, the telecommunications and semiconductor giant had operating earnings of $142 million, or 23 cents a share, right in line with what analysts had projected after being warned a month ago to reduce their estimates. **********Last month's warning had focused attention on the problems Motorola and other major technology companies were facing as a result of Asian currency declines and the resulting economic woes in several key Asian countries. Motorola had issued its bad news on the heels of a warning from the Intel Corporation, another technology bellwether, that its earnings would be below projections. But at the time Motorola had also injected a note of hope when it said that it had seen signs that Asia's economic problems were abating. **********Yesterday, though, Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said that problems in Asia might continue for ''several more quarters.'' The company also said that it was being hurt by weakening demand for pagers and analog cellular telephones in the United States. **********''Second-quarter sales are expected to be below those of a year ago,'' Mr. Galvin said. ''Second-quarter earnings are expected to be well below current investment community expectations and could be equal to or less than 1998 first-quarter earnings.'' **********The earnings and disappointing forecast were released after trading had ended on the New York Stock Exchange, where Motorola's share price fell 31.25 cents, to $59.875. Analysts were awaiting the chance to question the company in a conference call scheduled for early today. **********Motorola has long been among the most widely held of technology stocks, but its usefulness as a barometer for the sector has been questionable for some time. Analysts say that many of its problems, especially in the wireless communications business, result from poor execution rather than industrywide pressures. **********Motorola's largest business, the  cellular phone group, increased sales to $2.81 billion in the first quarter as demand grew for the company's new digital products, but overall orders were flat and operating profits dropped as sales of its older, analog products fell sharply. The semiconductor business, which sells many of its products to the cellular group and other Motorola operations as well as externally, had a 4 percent decline in orders, although sales edged up 1 percent, to $1.83 billion. **********Motorola's radio sector had a 27 percent increase in sales, to $1.24 billion; increased profits, and a 2  percent growth in new orders. But that was partly offset by the messaging sector, which includes paging products, where sales tumbled 25 percent, to $693 million, orders fell 21 percent and Motorola lost money. Motorola said that the paging decline reflected efforts by retailers to reduce inventory and that sales to consumers in the key North American and Chinese markets appeared to still be growing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/06/technology/phone-lines-and-lines-and-lines-keeping-their-appeal.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1998-08-06", "snippet": "Consumers are being given growing array of options for meeting their escalating need to fax, phone, send E-mail and go out on Internet; many newer transmission options are expensive, with higher service costs and extra charges for special modems, ...", "word_count": 1582, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phone Lines, and Lines and Lines, Keeping Their Appeal", "print_headline": "Phone Lines, and Lines and Lines, Keeping Their Appeal", "body_text": " **********CALL it phone-line meltdown, if you will; consumers know it well. It's that angina-inducing moment when an avalanche of both voice and data transmission needs threaten to turn your single, humble phone line, as well as your patience, into a pile of ashes. **********Trying to stay in touch with the office -- 20 calls a day -- as well as surf the Net? Good luck. Plain-vanilla phone lines can do only so much. **********In the past year in particular, consumers have been given a growing array of options for meeting their escalating need to fax, phone, send E-mail and go out on the Internet. As a result, they no longer have to rely on just a phone line or two. **********But many of these newer transmission options, like cable Internet connections and A.D.S.L. (asymmetrical digital subscriber lines), are currently available only in certain parts of the country. And while their prices are dropping, they are, for the most part, still expensive, with not just higher service costs but also extra charges for special modems, installation and even Internet service providers. Even then, technical support for the services is often less than encouraging. **********Given the constraints of newer technologies, many consumers are sticking with the tried and true. That usually means simply increasing the number of regular phone lines, from one or two to three or four -- or more. By all accounts, sales of regular phone lines are booming. An extra line is usually no more than $20 a month, with installation starting around $75. **********In California, for example, Pacific Bell has installed a record number of telephone access lines in the past three financial quarters, and almost all of those installations have been standard phone lines, which use analog technology. Pacific Bell now offers its customers 17.7 million access lines. But it still has only about 170,000 customers for its I.S.D.N. (integrated services digital network) service. The company is now introducing A.D.S.L. service as well. **********At Bell Atlantic, sales of extra analog lines are also brisk. The number of sales first surged in 1994 and is now growing by 15 percent a year, said Debra Swann, executive director for consumer local and toll services at Bell Atlantic. **********Families with talk-happy teen-agers, as well as home offices, account for a good chunk of the interest, of course. At Pacific Bell, for example, about one-sixth of the requests for extra phone lines are now coming from families that plan to give the lines to teen-agers, said John Britton, a company spokesman. **********Still, heavy Internet use seems to be the factor that eventually drives most consumers to pile up dial tones. For example, in a survey of 7,800 households last fall, Ziff-Davis Marketing Intelligence found that 51 percent of those that used the Internet 16 hours or more a week had two or more lines, while 8 percent had three or more. **********At Byte Sized Computing, a home-office consulting business in Rye, N.Y., Dominick Curatola, the owner, said he was asked about the need for second lines ''almost every day.'' So far, he added, consumers seem to be sticking with analog technology. ''I think there's interest in newer technologies on a theoretical level, but the small office or home hasn't really begun to push it,'' Mr. Curatola said. That's because most people are buying computers that have modems that use traditional analog phone lines already built into them. **********''Quite honestly, consumers are having enough time with regular modems and services, let alone the fancier technologies,'' said Jim Mulcahy, who owns another computer consulting service, Computer Tutor @PCI  in Bronxville, N.Y. **********But many consumers may simply not yet need the lightning-fast transmission speeds of newer technologies like A.D.S.L. At its fastest, A.D.S.L. can pummel data along 250 times faster than a traditional 28.8-Kbps (kilobits per second) modem. **********''The killer application for the Internet is still E-mail,'' said Doug Michelman, another spokesman for Pacific Bell. ''More often than not, consumers are accessing the Internet for E-mail.'' **********Cost, however, may be an equally strong motivator. Take the McCalmont family of Cincinnati. The McCalmonts already have three phone lines. Yet until recently, they found themselves juggling those lines constantly to meet their considerable voice and data needs. Both Mr. McCalmont and his wife, Alyce, for example, work from home as professional organizers; as such, they not only need to maintain a semblance of order at home regarding communications but also need to rely on open phone lines for business calls and the Internet. **********But the McCalmonts' daughter, Laura, 16, is on the phone constantly. And their son, Drew, 14, spends so much time on the Internet -- up to 12 hours a day in the summer -- that he now has his own phone line. **********Earlier this year, the McCalmonts realized that they needed to expand their phone line capacity fast. But they were already paying almost $200 a month for their three lines, an Internet service provider and three car phones. As a result, I.S.D.N. service was never an option. In the Cincinnati area, it costs $110 a month for service alone, while installation, an I.S.D.N. modem and Internet service cost extra. **********Of course, the McCalmonts could have installed a fourth phone line, at a service cost of about $20 a month. Three months ago, however, they opted for an even cheaper, as well as simpler, solution: an Internet call manager service from Cincinnati Bell.  For $7 a month, the service lets them answer or transfer an incoming call while they are using the Internet on their business line.  They can also flash callers a message to let them know they will return the call. **********Jon Kiphart is also staying true to his analog phone lines. As a freelance programmer who, among other things, automates theme park rides, Mr. Kiphart often finds himself connecting to the Internet from phones in far-flung locales like Malaysia that are not equipped to send and receive data on line and that also have limited access to digital phone technology. **********For times like these, Mr. Kiphart carries his own acoustical modem, a coupling device designed for phones. At home, in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., he makes do with two analog phone lines, even though he often has to download large files chock full of graphics. **********''I've heard that I.S.D.N. modems are very difficult to set up,'' he said. ''And what I need is ease of use, durability and reliability, as well as the ability to tap into my computer from exotic locations.'' **********Cost, however, is also a sticking point for Mr. Kiphart. ''If the local cable service were able to deliver Internet service for $20 a month, I'd go for it,'' he said. ''I'd also be willing to pay $30 a month for unlimited I.S.D.N. access. But right now I'm already spending between $200 and $300 a month for two analog lines, Internet service, a cell phone and a pager.'' **********Digital technologies are becoming more affordable. For example, computer manufacturers are expected to roll out products that have A.D.S.L. modems built into them as early as next year. Meanwhile, A.D.S.L. technology, unlike I.S.D.N., carries the advantage of not being metered, so consumers can usually get unlimited service for between $70 and $90 a month. That fee, however, doesn't cover A.D.S.L.'s hefty installation and modem costs, which can chalk up an extra $600 or more. **********Phone companies are trying to keep connection costs down as well. For example, when Bell Atlantic begins rolling out A.D.S.L. service next month, start-up fees will be held to less than $200 for an introductory promotional period. That fee will include a $99 connection fee and an A.D.S.L. modem for less than $100. Bell Atlantic says  it will also waive fees for any home wiring work that may be necessary and any setup help that customers may need to reconfigure their computers for the new technology. **********Peter Castleton, director of data products for Bell Atlantic, says consumer interest in the company's A.D.S.L. service has been overwhelming so far. ''There seems to be pent-up demand for it,'' he added. **********Still, for now, many consumers seem to be sticking with the technology that gives them the fewest number of headaches. One example is Beth Rowan, a public relations and marketing consultant who lives in Bronxville, N.Y. **********Ms. Rowan works from her home and has two teen-agers, ages 13 and 16. Not surprisingly, she likes ''to have things simple and straightforward, rather than the latest technology on the block.'' As a result, when she needed more phone capacity last summer, she simply installed a third phone line. **********Ms. Rowan may move to a faster transmission technology yet: she says she is tired of the ''antiquated'' phone system in her county that allows her to surf the Net at a speed of only about 28 Kbps, even though she has a 56-Kbps modem. For now, though, sheis sticking with the simplest solution possible. **********So is Elizabeth Wise, a psychology student in Bronxville. Ms. Wise does a lot of Web surfing, and her husband, a financial analyst, often has to use one of the family's two phone lines to transmit lengthy reports to the computer at his office in Manhattan. **********Even though Ms. Wise's home was wired for I.S.D.N. technology in a recent renovation, she is sticking with analog phone lines for now because of cost and because she knows that newer transmission technologies, like cable and satellite, will be coming along. **********''I'm waiting to see how these other technologies are going to shake down,'' she said. ''I want what is simplest, as well as most economical, for the home user. And when I get it, I'll stick with it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/29/business/company-news-republic-security-to-buy-first-palm-beach.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-05-29", "snippet": "Republic Security Financial Corp to acquire First Palm Beach Bancorp for $279.3 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REPUBLIC SECURITY TO BUY FIRST PALM BEACH", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; REPUBLIC SECURITY TO BUY FIRST PALM BEACH", "body_text": " **********The Republic Security Financial Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire a crosstown bank, First Palm Beach Bancorp, for $279.3 million in stock.

But in a meeting in Hong Kong last October, Chinese security officials assured him that if he visited China he would not face arrest, Mr. Hua told friends before he left for Beijing on Dec. 31. **********On Jan. 6 he was arrested, and in February he was charged with divulging state secrets. **********The American Embassy here said today that it had raised the issue with China on behalf of Mr. Hua, who is a permanent resident of the United States and is seeking citizenship but remains a Chinese citizen. **********Stanford officials have also argued on Mr. Hua's behalf in letters to President Jiang Zemin. Colleagues at the university's Center for International Security and Cooperation, where Mr. Hua worked, say they are deeply concerned about his health. Shortly before leaving for Beijing he had surgery for a rare form of male breast cancer, and he was to receive chemotherapy on his return to California last winter. **********The Chinese Government has not commented publicly on the case. Until recently not even relatives were allowed to see him, and family members who have since had contact are not speaking to the press. He has a lawyer, who has also declined to speak to the press. Some people familiar with the case expect it to go to trial in the coming weeks. **********Officials at Stanford pressed his case quietly in hopes that he would be released. But this week, newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan reported on his arrest. **********A child of China's Communist elite, Mr. Hua was educated in Moscow, spent decades as a leading military scientist and in 1978 was given a national prize for his contributions to China's ballistic missile and satellite programs. **********To an unusual degree, Mr. Hua was allowed to maintain contacts with experts abroad, and in 1980 and 1981 he spent more than a year in the United States at the University of Washington and then at Stanford. **********In 1986, senior Chinese officials authorized Mr. Hua to provide advice to an American researcher on Chinese defense, John W. Lewis, who was writing books on China's nuclear and missile programs, Mr. Lewis said in an interview today. **********Mr. Lewis is the former director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation and has worked closely with Mr. Hua for the last nine years. The center has often served as an unofficial conduit for sharing information between the Chinese and American militaries. **********In this shadowy world of trading in not always reliable defense information, Mr. Hua became a player, often saying he had special contacts and information on Chinese programs, American defense experts said. **********In June 1989, during China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Hua was at a conference in the Soviet Union. He decided not to return to China -- he later said he had played a role in the democracy movement and feared arrest -- and moved to California when offered a position at the Stanford research center. **********In the early 1990's at Stanford, Mr. Hua wrote or was co-author of articles on the development of China's missiles and other sensitive topics. He collaborated with Mr. Lewis, for example, on an unusually detailed account of China's submarine nuclear missile program, said to be one of the items now held against him. **********Mr. Lewis said today that Mr. Hua had never provided vital information that was not already in the public domain or that he had not been previously authorized to share. **********At two international conferences in 1993, Mr. Hua had friendly meetings with top officials from China's military industries, Mr. Lewis said.

Officials say as many as 300 or more people are landing every day in Malaysia alone. **********This is Asia's new fear: a tide of desperate economic refugees who could begin to swamp the shores of their neighbors in what some are already calling a new wave of boat people. **********As much as the empty office buildings and shuttered factories of Southeast Asia's shrinking ''tiger'' economies, these crisscrossing streams of jobless workers are a new emblem of the region's hardships. **********''It is potentially explosive,'' said Razak Baginda, a Malaysian political scientist, ''and in terms of magnitude it could be worse than Vietnam, both because of the numbers and the proximity of the nations.'' **********It was only in 1996 that Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries finally sent home the last stragglers from among the Vietnamese boat people, more than 20 years after the end of the Vietnam War. **********Now the worry is Indonesia, just a few miles across the water, where experts predict that 8 million to 10 million people could be unemployed this year, out of a population of 200 million and a work force of 90 million. **********Hundreds of thousands -- or even millions -- of returnees from other countries will only add to Indonesia's hardships. **********The potential for violent disorders in Malaysia was clear two weeks ago when some illegal migrants rioted at a detention camp near Kuala Lumpur, the capital. Eight detainees and a police officer were killed, and scores were wounded. **********The first fears of an influx were expressed in Australia early this year. Indonesians angered by rising prices were turning against the ethnic Chinese minority that controls much of Indonesia's commerce. An outbreak of anti-Chinese riots raised memories of mass killings in 1965, when the Chinese were one of the targets. Many wealthy Chinese in Indonesia have already moved their families to Australia, Singapore or elsewhere. **********But for the present, officials here say, ethnic Chinese make up few of the new migrants. Instead, they come from the same poor class of Indonesians who for years have been welcomed as cheap labor. **********For more than a decade, migrant labor formed one of the engines of Asia's economic boom. Malaysia in particular, with a population of just 21 million, has relied on foreign workers in the last decade as it binged on huge construction projects. **********Foreign laborers now make up as much as a fifth of Malaysia's work force, including an estimated 1.2 million Indonesians, 800,000 of whom are here illegally. Some 25,000 Indonesians did most of the work in building a just-completed international airport. They are now being sent home. **********Ubiquitous in Kuala Lumpur but little noticed, small Indonesian ''villages'' are evidence of this large population of workers, with their lively Indonesian music, their rows of bird cages and the sweet smell of clove cigarettes. **********''There is no more work here, and we are ready to go home,'' said Mion Rakit, 27, who has worked here for 10 years but now spends his days playing cards with his friends. ''But times are tough at home, too.'' **********The situation is similar in Thailand, which is home to about a million illegal workers, most of them from neighboring Myanmar, the former Burma. With unemployment in Thailand forecast nearly to double, to more than two million, the Thais say they will expel some 300,000 foreign workers this year. **********''We don't have enough jobs for our own people,'' said Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan. ''How can we be expected to care for foreigners?'' **********Singapore is a smaller country with equally large fears of inundation by migrants. Its population is only three million, and its shores are only a two-hour boat ride from Indonesia. **********''We are literally a nation besieged,'' said the prosecutor in a trial last month at which 117 illegal migrants were sentenced to up to six weeks in jail and four to six strokes of the cane. **********That is the sentiment in Malaysia as well, where Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said: ''It is dangerous to have too many people unemployed. It can cause instability in Malaysia socially and even politically. We have to take care of our own people first; charity must begin at home.'' **********In addition to chasing down illegal migrants, Malaysia has announced that it will not renew the work permits of as many as 850,000 legal foreign workers when they expire in August. **********This raises the prospect of expulsions on a daunting scale. ''If we want to send back even half the illegal workers, how are we going to transport 400,000 people?'' said Mr. Baginda, the political scientist. **********At the same time, Malaysia has mounted an aggressive defense against new arrivals, including a small flotilla of naval vessels, a new radar system and posses of villagers who patrol their shores like wartime vigilantes. **********In the last three weeks of February alone, the police reported that 332 boats had brought 3,971 illegal migrants -- three-fourths of the total number of landings in all of 1997, when 444 boats brought 5,432 people. **********''I have every sympathy for Indonesians looking for work,'' said Rahim Noor, a political commentator.

Bell, best known as a manufacturer of bicycle helmets, had introduced its first skiing and snowboarding helmets just a few weeks before Michael L. Kennedy, and then Mr. Bono, suffered fatal head injuries on the slopes. **********''We've received more phone calls since those accidents than at any other time I can recall,'' said Terry G. Lee, Bell's chief executive. **********Investors seem interested, too. Shares in Bell, the only publicly traded maker of ski helmets, jumped from $8.44 on Dec. 31 to a close of $10.0625 on Jan. 7 before settling back to $9.4375 on Friday. And there are signs that this attention is more than a blip. Mr. Lee says demand for this protective headgear started rising even before the recent deaths. **********''Last year we saw helmets used in ski schools for the first time,'' he said. ''The market is pretty small, but it's been growing.'' About 80,000 ski helmets were sold last year, a 22 percent increase over 1996. **********Bell's entry into this arena -- it began making plans in late 1996 -- is a small element of a large turnaround effort. The company, which makes bicycle and auto-racing helmets and accessories under the Bell, Giro, Rhode Gear and other brand names, grew fast in the early 1990's as bicycle-helmet laws spurred demand. But in 1995 the rush of new laws slowed and Bell, saddled with some recent acquisitions, saw its earnings and stock price fall. **********So last year Bell, a 45-year-old company based in San Jose, Calif., spun off several underperforming divisions and cut costs. The effect was immediate. Excluding one-time charges related to the spinoffs, Bell earned 37 cents a share in the 12 months ended last June, up from 1 cent a share in the previous 12 months. In the quarter ended in September, it earned 5 cents a share, up from the break-even point in the quarter a year earlier. **********Investors noticed the improvements, and the stock went from around $6 a share to a 52-week closing high of $10.875 last fall. But whether the stock is a good value is unclear; analysts have not yet adjusted the stock's price-earnings ratio for the recent spinoffs. **********''The company has been through some tough times, but it has a very good balance sheet and a wonderful brand name,'' said Lee H. Allen, a stock analyst with Allen Financial Advisors in Boston. **********This year, bicycle helmets are expected to furnish most of the revenue growth for Bell, which had sales of $215 million for the year ended last June, excluding those of the spun-off divisions. Mr. Lee says there are still pockets of high demand for the bike helmets, especially in overseas markets, which now account for only 25 percent of Bell's sales. Longer term, analysts say, much will hinge on Bell's ability to keep leveraging its strong brand names. **********Those names may play a central role in the ski-helmet market, where Bell must compete with Boeri and Briko, the two European brands that are the market's biggest. **********As for demand for the helmets, Mr. Lee is hopeful. ''We're getting a tremendous amount of inquiries from sports-equipment dealers, and we've even had consumers walking into our headquarters off the street,'' he said. **********Indeed, because fewer than 10 percent of skiers are wearing helmets, there is plenty of room for growth. And at least one state legislator, Representative Robert Bacon of Colorado, is considering whether to include skiing in a pending bill that would mandate helmets for in-line skating and bicycling for children. **********On the other hand, some people question the effectiveness of ski helmets. With respect to the two celebrities, for instance, ''It's just not clear that either would have survived if they were wearing helmets,'' said Dr. John C. Nelson, a spokesman for the American Medical Association. **********Moreover, the A.M.A. estimates that from 1981 to 1997, only 2.6 percent of skiing accidents resulted in head injuries, and fewer than 1 percent of those were fatal. Generally, skiing is safer than sports like bicycling and swimming, according to the National Safety Council. **********''The average recreational skier probably doesn't need a helmet,'' Dr. Nelson said, ''as long as he knows the terrain and he uses common sense.'' **********All told, and without more evidence of rising demand, potential Bell investors should not hang their hopes solely on the ski-helmet market. ''I think the strength of the Bell and Giro names will give the company a leg up, and that ski helmets will be a possible incremental source of profit growth,'' said Stephen Schoene, a bond analyst at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company in New York. ''But the potential for this company in the bike-helmet market is probably much greater.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/05/business/company-news-recycling-industries-to-purchase-metals-broker.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-08-05", "snippet": "Recycling Industries to acquire Jefferson Iron and Metal Brokerage Inc for undisclosed price (S)", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RECYCLING INDUSTRIES TO PURCHASE METALS BROKER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; RECYCLING INDUSTRIES TO PURCHASE METALS BROKER", "body_text": " **********Recycling Industries, a metals recycling company with about $360 million in annual revenue, agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Jefferson Iron and Metal Brokerage Inc. for an undisclosed price.

The hope is that these stores-without-walls will attract parents with modems and motivation, people either too busy or too impatient to deal with the big chain stores' huge, warehouse-like retail outlets. **********So, well ahead of the 1998 critical year-end selling season, toy companies are racing to become the Amazon.com of their industry. Some of the on-line players include Noodle Kidoodle Inc., Toys ''R'' Us and the leading upstart company, Etoys, a unit of Idealab. Some manufacturers, including Mattel Inc., which has a Barbie Web site, www.barbie.com, are also experimenting with on-line marketing. **********Having had one of its best years in a decade last year, thanks to a healthy economy, and hoping for a repeat performance this year, the toy industry is in an expansive, experimental mood. Though on-line retailing still accounts for only $13 million of the $22 billion annual United States toy market, the virtual toy shop is the industry's attempt to find new or additional sales among the households that are most likely to value time-saving efficiency and to have the discretionary income to pay a premium for such convenience. Nearly 20 million Americans now shop on line, according to the Web measurement company Media Metrix Inc. **********But the industry's move on line is not without risk. The big retailers face the same sort of internal conflicts that the bookseller Barnes & Noble does in trying to counter Amazon.com -- how to respond to the on-line upstarts without cannibalizing the brick-and-mortar franchise. **********Toy makers must venture carefully into cyberspace, lest their direct-sales activities rankle the retailers they rely upon to move their merchandise. **********For their part, the on-line upstarts, despite the cost advantages of not having to invest in stores, warehouses and big inventories, may find themselves struggling to match the marketing muscle of big established retail brand names. **********Then there is the question of whether the touch and the texture of toy shopping can translate as readily to the digital realm as some other consumer activities that have taken hold on line, like booking airline seats or trading shares of stock. **********''One of the big strengths of toy retailing is the in-store excitement, merchandising and the personal touch,'' said Frank Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings, a toy industry publication. ''There is a danger of that getting lost in the web of technology. The initiatives, attitude and approach have to be a virtual representation of the store itself, and that's not an easy thing to do.'' **********The toy merchants are undaunted, though. **********The large retailers say they will win the Internet game because their well-regarded names and vast resources give them an in with consumers that should spill over into on-line selling. For customers, the companies say, those strengths will translate into low prices, quick response to orders and a better chance of finding limited-edition items -- like Mattel's popular Share a Smile Becky doll, a wheelchair-bound friend of Barbie -- that smaller toy sellers may have trouble obtaining in large volume. **********But the small, niche operators say they have the upper hand because they offer many of the must-have items and also specialty products -- like Schylling's make-your-own chewing gum kit -- that tend to sell in such small numbers that the big guys find them not worth stocking. **********And whether large or small, the companies say they can offer on-line consumers the advantage of not having to traipse around in search of the last Beanie Baby in town. **********Longer term, toy merchants envision that this type of retailing will become the modern equivalent of that more traditional form of direct-to-consumer marketing -- catalogue shopping. Like catalogue sales, which rely on mailing lists assembled from consumers' past buy-by-mail habits, the data bases created by electronic commerce would enable toy makers to observe the shopping habits of computerized households and use discounts and other enticements to keep them coming back for more. It is a way for merchants to get to know their customers' preferences to an extent not possible when a person goes into a store and pays cash for a Sing and Snore Ernie. **********All of the industry's behind-the-scenes strategizing for her money and loyalty is just fine by Chana Wilson, a housewife and mother of two boys, ages 3 and 12, who was in the market recently for an ant farm for her out-of-state nephew. ''I knew I had to buy a toy, wrap it up and ship it to Houston,'' said Mrs. Wilson, who lives in Beckley, W.Va., and ranks shopping at toy stores right up there with visiting the dentist. **********Trying to avoid ''all that rigamarole,'' Mrs. Wilson, whose husband, Derric, is a supervisor at a prison, went on line and found Etoys, where she bought an Uncle Milton ant farm for $19.95 plus $4 for shipping and $3 for gift wrapping. **********''That saved me time and money and a major headache with my 3-year-old,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ''You just don't want to take a 3-year-old shopping for other kids' toys.'' **********It is just this sort of shopper that the big conventional retailers are going after. Toys ''R'' Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, started a Web site last month that it intends to heavily advertise on the Internet as well as on television and through home delivery circulars later this year. So far, the site has about 2,000 items, compared with about 15,000 stocked in Toys ''R'' Us stores. Tens of thousands of Internet users have already visited the site, though the company declined to say how many had bought anything. **********Visitors to www.toysrus.com, are assured that shopping is ''fun and fast.'' Say, for instance, someone is clueless as to what to buy an 8-year-old girl. The shopper need only choose a category, like dolls, click on the child's age and the target price. Seconds later a suggested list of merchandise appears, including Baby Pick Me Up, which sells for $14.97 plus shipping and handling. **********Just like a theater operator who tries to drum up concession sales by piping in the smell of freshly popped corn, Toys ''R'' Us is using its personalized suggestion feature also to get shoppers to consider buying items they may not have intended to. Those looking for dolls, for instance, are also shown a Barbie Disc Girl CD Player for $16.99. Call it an electronic hard sell. **********Prices are typically the same for toys bought on line or in stores. But the convenience of Internet shopping does mean having to pay shipping rates, which are about $5 for a $25 order and around $9 for a $100 purchase. The companies insist, though, that the cost is more than worth the convenience. **********''People are more strapped for time, and they are looking for new ways of shopping,'' said Joel Anderson, vice president of Toys ''R'' Us Direct. ''There is a new medium out there that is emerging, and it is an area we need to be in.'' **********The toy maker Hasbro Inc. is feeling the same need. The company, which has been dabbling in on-line product marketing for more than a year, recently hired a specialist in Internet commerce to develop a plan to advertise further and sell selected items like collectibles directly to the consumer (www.hasbro.com). The executive, Wendy Riches, had managed the interactive advertising unit of WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather agency, as part of her role as chairman and chief executive of the Ogilvy One North America division. **********One potential problem is that Hasbro sells mainly to retailers, some of whom may frown on any form of added competition. This sort of conflict has also been a problem for computer makers, like Compaq, which has a well-established network of distributors who have been wary of the company's plan to expand into on-line direct sales. **********Already, some toy retailers are raising concern about Hasbro's intentions. ''This is the manufacturer cutting out the middle man,'' said Shane Igoe, new media manager at F.A.O. Schwarz, which was one of the first toy sellers to go on line when it started www.faoschwarz.com nearly two years ago. **********Toys ''R'' Us is less concerned, saying Hasbro's Internet appeal will be limited because it will offer only its own brands and not Barbie, Beanie Babies and other popular toys made by its competitors. For its part, Hasbro says its on-line selling efforts are not meant to put it in competition with Toys ''R'' Us or any other retailer. Rather, the company says, it is seeking to augment what retailers are already doing, even listing store locations where shoppers can find certain items. **********''We look at this as a partnership with the retail trade,'' said Adam Klein, Hasbro's head of global marketing. ''Each one of our key retailers is going at this thing a different way. We have to have our own in-house expertise to both work with them and, where there are gaps, to be able to recognize them and go after these opportunities.'' **********Hasbro also says that, at least initially, it will limit its toy selling to items not available in retail stores. The company, which has not determined when it will begin selling on line beyond the interactive products like the Yahtzee CD-ROM it already offers, was fuzzy on whether consumers would have to pay retail prices for toys bought directly from the manufacturer. Mr. Klein said only that ''the idea is not to compete with the retail trade, and this is part of everything we are going to be looking at.'' **********With Hasbro and other industry giants edging in on its domain, Etoys, a year-old company based in Santa Monica, Calif., that has about 3,000 items listed for sale on its site, www.toys.com, may need a Star Wars laser to fend them off. But the company says its strength is in the range of playthings it provides. **********''What we do is have the popular products and also have a lot of cool products like kits to make your own chewing gum, products you never see in Toys 'R' Us,'' said Toby Lenk, chief executive of Etoys. ''A big retail buyer can't buy six of something. It's too inefficient for them so they buy in bulk and can't test on a smaller scale.'' **********Etoys also knows it will have to rev up its marketing machine to avoid getting overshadowed by the competition. Without discussing precise amounts, the company said it planned to triple its multimillion-dollar marketing budget for the next six months. **********If people like Mrs. Wilson, the mother in West Virginia, are any indication, the on-line toy market is up for grabs to anyone who can make toy shopping effortless without significantly adding cost. But won't she miss an intrinsic part of the toy-buying experience by buying a lovable baby doll without first giving it a squeeze or without reading product information on a box of building blocks? **********''Heavens, no,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ''I could care less. I already know what a box of Legos looks like. I wish I'd found this before last Christmas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/08/business/company-news-winstar-communications-buys-bowne-s-lansystems.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-08-08", "snippet": "Winstar Communications Inc buys assets of Bowne & Co's Lansystems unit for about $23 million in cash (S)", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WINSTAR COMMUNICATIONS BUYS BOWNE'S LANSYSTEMS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; WINSTAR COMMUNICATIONS BUYS BOWNE'S LANSYSTEMS", "body_text": " **********Winstar Communications Inc. bought the assets of Bowne & Company's Lansystems unit for about $23 million in cash as the company enters the data-services business.

Many hedge funds are based offshore and are not available to American investors. **********Should mutual fund investors worry if their fund companies introduce hedge funds? There are some sticky issues. **********A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., said mutual fund directors and investors should keep a close eye on a mutual fund's performance if the manager is also running a hedge fund. The issue is whether the manager will do as good a job with the mutual fund when he can make more money from the hedge fund; if the mutual fund's performance declines, he added, ''the directors should refocus the manager back on the mutual fund.'' **********There are other issues, too. Independent hedge funds can sell their holdings in a stock all at once, but if a hedge fund is part of a mutual fund company, it generally must sell pari passu -- at an equal pace -- with the company's mutual funds that hold the same stock, constraining flexibility. **********And what if a company's hedge and mutual funds invest in the same stocks and those stocks drop? Mutual fund investors, who can withdraw money at any time, are likely to yank their cash first. So, as the mutual fund jettisons a stock to meet redemptions, the value of the stock may drop further, damaging the hedge fund's holdings. **********Hedge-fund investors, meanwhile, are generally locked in for at least six months.  According to one investor in the Robertson Stephens Orphans Hedge fund, which holds illiquid stocks, its value has fallen over the last 18 months as investors in the Robertson Stephens Contrarian mutual fund, which holds similar stocks, have been bailing. A spokeswoman for the funds was unavailable for comment. **********Despite these complexities, and the headline-grabbing troubles of Long Term Capital Management and other hedge funds, mutual fund companies are likely to keep introducing hedge funds as they seek to increase fee income and economies of scale, and try to hold onto sought-after managers. **********Rolling out hedge funds lets fund companies employ their core strengths without much extra overhead. Fund managers on staff are usually all too happy to run a hedge fund on the side, as the pay, often based on the total fees, can be lucrative. ''The reason they're doing this is to keep their best managers in house,'' Ms. Peltz said. **********Typically, hedge funds get 1 percent of assets as well as 20 percent of gains above their previous highs. By contrast, the median fee on general equity mutual funds is 1.3 percent of assets, according to Lipper. **********Just last August, State Street Research rolled out a hedge fund, Small Cap Energy, whose managers, Dan Rice and Tom Moore, also run the State Street Research Global Resources mutual fund. So far, the hedge fund has under $11.5 million in assets, compared with $164 million in the mutual fund. **********The prime difference, according to Robin Tice, a State Street spokeswoman, is the mutual fund's broader portfolio, which is wont to include gold and other kinds of companies. ''We started it because we have expertise in managing energy and natural resources investments,'' she said. **********If hedge funds are picking many of the same stocks held by mutual funds, why pay the higher fees? One hedge-fund expert said that if an investor believes in a manager, that investor may be willing to take the hedge fund's additional risks of greater leverage, or portfolio concentration, to get higher returns. And hedge funds can invest in often-lucrative private partnerships. **********Alliance Capital is the biggest mutual fund newcomer in the hedge-fund business. Since 1994, it has rolled out 13 hedge funds, six domestic and seven offshore. **********Alliance executives are reluctant to talk about them. ''Hedge funds are basically partnerships, and the S.E.C. does not permit funds to advertise,'' said Charles Schaffran, who oversees Alliance's hedge funds. Newspaper interviews, he said, ''might be viewed as advertising.'' **********SOME mutual fund companies say the experience of running hedge funds can yield good investment ideas that are cross-fertilized with their mutual funds. **********Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli & Company manages 27 mutual funds, has run risk-arbitrage hedge funds since 1985 and now runs a number of other hedge funds. ''To the degree that our analyst Laura Lanahan makes a comment about the Pulitzer merger with Hearst-Argyle, the arbitrageurs would hitch on,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/business/working-finessing-your-freedom.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Cottle", "pub_date": "1998-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 568, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Finessing Your Freedom", "print_headline": "WORKING; Finessing Your Freedom", "body_text": " **********Q. I'm a part-time contractor at a high-technology company. Recently, my supervisor asked if I would be interested in a full-time job, at less pay per hour but with stock options and other benefits. The truth is that I'm not interested -- I like the freedom and my current pay -- but I worry that if I reject his offer, he'll replace me with someone committed to the long haul. Any negotiating suggestions? **********A. Freedom or security: It's a stark choice -- and one that your employer may not realize is a tough call for you. Because the company wants you full time, it clearly likes your work. Nevertheless, before deciding on a bargaining approach, talk with your boss about exactly why he made the offer. **********''It may be that the company is looking to cut expenses or reduce its number of consultants,'' said Bob Deissig, president of recruiting services for the Ayers Group, a human resources consulting firm in New York. If so, you should seek ways to maximize your value -- like increasing your work load but not your fee -- that would make the company more willing to keep you on your terms. **********Alternatively, your boss may simply be dazzled by your technical prowess and is afraid of losing you. Employers are often much more worried about your taking off than you are about being replaced -- particularly in this tight job market, said Robin Ryan, a Seattle-based career counselor and author of ''Winning Resumes'' (John Wiley & Sons, 1997). **********In either case, the operative word is tact. By turning down a full-time gig, you are saying, in essence: ''I really like you guys, but not enough to commit.'' Think about how that line played in your last personal relationship. Employers tend to take rejection about as well as insecure girlfriends or boyfriends, so when breaking the news to your supervisor, let him down easy. **********Blame it on the money, Ms. Ryan advised: ''Go to your employer and say, 'I just can't take a salary cut at this time.' '' This puts your rejection in practical, hard-dollar terms that most business types can grasp. After all, stock options are a nice perk, but they can't pay the rent, and they often have no value until you have been with a company for 3, 5 or 10 years. **********But no matter how practical your reasons, you need to make your rejection as flattering as possible, Mr. Deissig said. ''Tell your supervisor how honored you are by the offer,'' he said, ''and stress how terrific you think the organization is.'' Emphasize that you have no intention of abandoning the firm. ''Assure them that the offer makes you even more committed to the organization,'' he added, ''and ask what you can do to make everyone more comfortable with your consultant status.'' **********If you do plan to stay, Mr. Deissig said, consider negotiating a long-term contract. **********Of course, if your employer is desperate to hire you, he may counter with a second offer at your current pay -- or higher. At that point, you'll have to re-evaluate just how much you want to stay footloose and freelance. **********Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

This was the widest gap since the department began using its current monthly measurement system in 1992 and was last exceeded late in 1987 under a system that measured trade on a quarterly basis. **********The deficit in goods alone rose to $18.8 billion, the highest level on record, from $17.7 billion in December. **********Economists have predicted for months that Asia's woes would begin slowing the robust American economy, and today's figures provided the first clear evidence that the process was under way. **********''This is the beginning of Asia kicking in, and it is the harbinger of wider deficits to come,'' said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia. **********With American exporters feeling the bite, the Clinton Administration stepped up efforts today to press Japan into reviving its moribund economy to help pull Asia out of its crisis. For the first time, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers specified how much the United States wanted Japan to increase public spending and cut taxes: 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product. That is roughly equivalent to $77 billion. **********Mr. Summers acknowledged that Japanese officials were becoming increasingly angry at American criticism of how their economy was being managed. But, he said, ''Just as our Japanese and European friends appropriately criticized U.S. budget deficits, we think it is appropriate'' to specify how Japan should stimulate its economy for the good of its trading partners. **********Analysts said they expected widening trade deficits in coming months to exert more of a drag on growth in the United States. **********But they said it remained unclear whether the otherwise strong economy would slow sufficiently to avoid inflation pressures that would lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates -- or whether the economy might slow so much that an interest-rate cut would be justified. **********Inflation statistics released today provided few clues to which way the economy might tip. The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index for February rose one-tenth of 1 percent, held down by falling oil prices, leaving the inflation rate for the last year at 1.4 percent. Excluding food and energy, the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, its biggest jump since last April. Most of the rise, though, came from one-time increases in items like cigarette prices and rent, rather than broad-based price increases. **********Falling oil prices also made the trade deficit look smaller, since the value of energy imports would otherwise have been much higher. As it was, the trade figures showed how the difficulties among some of the nation's fastest-growing export markets were being felt at home. **********The most compelling evidence was in the figures for trade with the four original ''Asian tiger'' economies. The combined deficit in those markets -- South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan -- jumped to $2.2 billion for the month, up from $841 million in December and $783 million a year earlier. **********The deficit just with South Korea, one of the nations hit hardest by financial crisis, rose to $856 million from $341 million. In January 1997, the United States had a trade surplus with South Korea of $181 million. **********The deficit with Japan, one of the most politically sensitive indicators of American trade performance, narrowed to $4.4 billion, from $5.1 billion in December, when the gap was particularly high. **********The deficit with China, which now rivals that of Japan in economic and political significance, rose in January to $3.7 billion from $2.7 billion. **********While considerable attention has been focused on how Asian financial problems are hurting trade, economists said the overall impact on the United States was mixed. The currency devaluations across Asia have made imports from there into the United States less expensive, dampening inflation and forcing domestic competitors to hold down prices. **********Low inflation and a flood of investment from Asia into United States Treasury bonds have pushed down interest rates, reducing borrowing costs for American businesses and consumers and setting off mortgage refinancing that has left more money in the pockets of many people. **********While the slowing of exports to Asia could significantly cut growth in this country, the slowdown will be partly offset by the reduction in interest rates and by low oil prices, analysts said. While many economists still expect growth to slow from its 3.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter, few predict that it will slow in the current quarter to what has been considered a sustainable pace of 2.5 percent or less. **********''The domestic part of the economy is really on fire,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman of the PNC Corporation. ''If the trade deficit held at its current level through February and March, it could knock one and a quarter percentage points off the growth rate, but that would leave real G.D.P. growth at 3 or 3.5 percent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/world/troops-occupy-ulster-town-on-eve-of-protestant-march.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1998-07-05", "snippet": "British soldiers ring the Drumcree neighborhood of Portadown, Northern Ireland, in effort to prevent sectarian violence on July 5, when Orange Order says it will try to march down down a Catholic street to celebrate 1690 Battle of the Boyne; photo...", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Troops Occupy Ulster Town on Eve of Protestant March", "print_headline": "Troops Occupy Ulster Town on Eve of Protestant March", "body_text": " **********In an effort to prevent sectarian violence on Sunday, hundreds of British soldiers ringed the small Portadown neighborhood called Drumcree today and installed thousands of yards of four-foot-high barbed wire in the surrounding fields. **********The soldiers, armed with automatic rifles and in full combat uniform, seemed to be everywhere for several miles around. **********They and hundreds of armed police officers blocked roads with huge slabs of cement and forced residents of this town 35 miles west of Belfast to show identification as they neared the small steepled Church of Ireland Protestant church. **********''There's more Brits at Drumcree than there were at Dunkirk,'' a taxi dispatcher said. **********For the fourth consecutive year, Drumcree is the focal point of anger, and some hatred, between Roman Catholics and the Protestants of the Orange Order.

The decision last Monday pleased the Catholics. But the Orange Order has insisted that it will confront the security forces and try to march down the road anyway. **********This has angered many of the area's 6,000 Catholics, led by Brendan MacCionnaith, a former Irish Republican Army operative who served time in a British prison for taking part in the bombing of a Protestant meeting hall in 1981.

They don black suits, bowler hats and orange sashes, while their drums and fifes and bugles play military airs. **********Catholics say that the parades are triumphalist and that allowing the Orangemen to march through Catholic neighborhoods is comparable to allowing the Ku Klux Klan to march through Harlem. **********By this afternoon, no compromise was in sight, but officials continued to try. Mr. MacCionnaith, in an interview this morning, said the British Government had to ''make a stand'' to enforce the ban on the march through his area. He said he had made a ''very generous offer'' to the Orangemen. But the Orangemen, and many Protestant officials, refuse to talk to him because of his I.R.A. background. **********Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, said in a speech on Friday, ''The Orange march on the Garvaghy Road is not about religious tolerance, but about intolerance. The standoff by the Garvaghy Road residents is not a threat to the Orange Order. If the Orange Order wishes to march along this route, it needs to talk directly to the coalition,'' that is, to Mr. MacCionnaith. **********David Trimble, the Protestant First Minister of the New Northern Ireland Assembly, said today that ''in this very dangerous time'' people should ''keep calm, keep the peace.'' **********At the parade three years ago, Mr. Trimble marched with the Orangemen and raised his arm in triumph, angering Catholics.

Today, Mr. Lydell, 59, runs one of the most successful hosta businesses in the country, mostly because he has figured out how to differentiate himself from his rivals in flower-selling. **********If you happened into the Corner Snack Bar here around noon on a recent weekday and witnessed him in his trademark pith helmet, digging into a plate of flapjacks and trading gossip with the other regulars, you would probably not have picked him out as a marketing genius. **********But appearances can be deceiving. When he had his brainstorm in 1981, Mr. Lydell knew a thing or two about flowers. As the owner of a small landscaping business, he understood that outdoor floral displays could work magic on consumers' wallets. And, as a graduate of the State Agricultural and Technical Institute at Alfred, he realized that hostas, unlike roses and other popular flowers, were nearly virgin territory for the creation of new varieties through hybridization. **********Today his Eagle Bay Hosta Gardens, a three-acre sanctuary of bridges, ponds, an arbor and a faded red barn, contain 800 hosta varieties and 15,000 plants. Outsiders can meander freely around it anytime they happen to be passing through this hamlet in the grape country of Chautauqua County, near Lake Erie. **********''It's incredibly important for people to see how the flowers they're buying will eventually look,'' he said.  On any day during the growing season, the enthusiasts wander in, video cameras in hand. Some are from Europe or Asia. **********In his research operation, Mr. Lydell has 1,000 hybrids ''under observation,'' monitoring them during six or seven years for flower color, form, height, uniqueness of the leaf pattern and resistance to slugs, a scourge of hostas. Once satisfied, he ships the hybrid off to the University of Minnesota, home of the worldwide hosta registry. If his variety is accepted, he can sell the first 100 plants, the flower world's equivalent of first-issue postage stamps, for a total of $1,500 to $10,000. His record sale for a single plant was $350. **********Currently, Mr. Lydell has registered 18 varieties. He calls his most recent creation Saybrook Surprise and his favorite, which resembles a yucca plant, Yucca Ducka Do. **********On the sales side, he is determined not to be outdone by the big mail-order flower merchants. He has his own Internet site (http://vinetime.com/eaglebaygardens/index.html) chock full of hosta news and, of course, order forms. But since gardeners can be technophobes, he continues to publish his color catalogue and accept orders by phone, fax and plain old snail mail. **********Sales have doubled every year in the last four years. Profits are up, too, enabling Mr. Lydell to buy his dream vacation home on Lake Erie not long ago. **********His second pith helmet is almost worn out, but Mr. Lydell has no plans to retire. ''You've got to be kidding me,'' he said. ''My youngest girl wants to go to medical school.'' He is expanding his flower park with picnic tables, public restrooms, a gazebo, a miniature tropical garden, an Alpine forest and a Japanese teahouse. **********TO be sure, the hosta business is not without its intrigue. ''There's a master plant thief who works out of New York City,'' Mr. Lydell whispered conspiratorially. ''He's stolen plants from the Emperor's gardens in Japan. It's like any other field where beautiful objects can sell for several thousand dollars. Serious collectors can get desperate.'' **********So far, Mr. Lydell's biggest problem with theft does not involve people. Last summer, some local deer became fond of feeding on one of his prized varieties. He tried everything to drive them off until he discovered that there was one thing they couldn't abide: country and western music on the radio. **********''The deer loved classical and soft rock,'' he said. ''It made them eat even faster. I finally found an upscale country station, which they absolutely hate. Now they have to go to the corner snack bar, just like the rest of us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/09/world/standoff-with-iraq-arabs-only-one-arab-nation-endorses-us-threat-attack-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1998-02-09", "snippet": "While Syria is only Arab nation to flatly declare that new military attack against Iraq is unwarranted, no other Arab country, with exception of Kuwait has endorsed American threats of military force despite assurances by Sec of State Madeleine K ...", "word_count": 1122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Only One Arab Nation Endorses U.S. Threat of Attack on Iraq", "print_headline": "STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE ARABS; Only One Arab Nation Endorses U.S. Threat of Attack on Iraq", "body_text": " **********Among the Persian Gulf war allies who fought to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in 1991, only Syria among Arab nations has flatly declared that a new attack on Iraq now would be unwarranted.  But with the exception of Kuwait, no Arab nation has endorsed the American threats of military action, despite the assurances that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she had received on her recent visit to the Middle East. **********And while Ms. Albright portrayed her trip as a success, the messages from top Arab officials have remained highly cautionary, heavy with suggestions that the renewed use of force against Iraq could set off more turmoil in a volatile region. **********After meeting today with King Hassan of Morocco, Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, said, ''As part of the ongoing consultations between Arab countries, Egypt and Morocco are against military strikes on Iraq.'' **********The resistance to the American strategy reflects the sentiments being voiced among many ordinary Arabs, and it could still complicate American decision-making about whether or how to carry out the threatened strikes. **********The message was expressed in less diplomatic language last week by the state-owned Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram. **********''The American position toward Iraq cannot be described as anything but coercive, aggressive, unwise and uncaring about the lives of Iraqis, who are unnecessarily subjected to sanctions and humiliation,'' the newspaper said in an editorial. **********Throughout the region, diplomats and other analysts say a new round of air strikes against Iraq could have a broadly negative political impact by reinforcing a view that the United States has little regard for Arab lives. **********Esmat Abdel-Maguid, Secretary General of the 21-member Arab League and leader of a delegation that returned from Baghdad over the weekend, warned here today that any resort to military force would be ''very detrimental to the situation in the world and the Middle East.'' **********A Cairo-based diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity echoed that view. **********''The clear view on the Arab street is that the United States is concerned only with promoting Israel's agenda,'' the diplomat said. ''And if the United States carries out its threats against Baghdad, it is going to have to face a new groundswell of anti-American sentiment.'' **********The editorial in Al Ahram called attention to what is widely called deliberate American blindness. **********''Current tensions in the region should be blamed on Israel, not Iraq,'' the newspaper said on Wednesday. ''Each time the United States toughens its line on Iraq and overlooks the nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal of Israel, which occupies Arab lands, it exposes its double standards. America will lose whatever remains of its credibility in the region if it launches aggression against Iraq.'' **********The Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, was clearly seeking to gain Arab support when his Government announced last week that it would free non-Iraqi Arabs from its prisons. **********Few Arabs regard Mr. Hussein with the esteem that many did before he invaded Kuwait in 1990. But many are prepared to see the Iraqi people, hit hard by United Nations sanctions, as victims, a sentiment that has permeated most Arab commentary on the current showdown. **********No Arab leader would be sorry if Mr. Hussein were ousted from power, and all have said Iraq must be given no choice but to heed the United Nations sanctions that require the weapons inspections. **********Some senior Arab officials -- particularly in the Persian Gulf region -- have even confided to diplomats and other visitors that their patience with Iraq has worn so thin that they agree that there may soon be no option but to subject Mr. Hussein to more punishment. **********But few if any Arab leaders are likely to express such sentiments in public, reflecting their apprehension that they could become targets of the kind of outrage likely to result if many Iraqi civilians fall victim to renewed American attacks. **********Such wariness made for a delicate backdrop as Defense Secretary William S. Cohen began his visit to the gulf tonight. Before he arrived, the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, was quoted in the Saudi newspaper Arab News today as saying his country did not favor a military strike against Iraq. **********Only Kuwait has explicitly backed a possible American-led attack. It is permitting the United States and Britain to send warplanes to its bases to reinforce a contingent of F-117-A ''stealth'' fighters already there, and Kuwaiti officials have made clear that they would have no problem with these aircraft being used in combat. **********Similarly, Bahrain is allowing the United States to send a third B-1 bomber in addition to two already there, and the tiny island country, which serves as headquarters to the Navy's Fifth Fleet, has signaled a willingness to once again become a base for military operations. **********In public, however, Bahraini officials have remained guarded. The Foreign Minister, Sheik Mohammed Mubarak al-Khalifa, said in an interview last week that he would not address the subject of using force against Iraq until the United States and its allies had first sought to ''exhaust all diplomatic initiatives.'' **********Among other American allies, even President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was saying early this month that a new attack would be ''inappropriate.'' Mr. Mubarak has softened such criticism since Ms. Albright's visit, and in the last week alone sent three separate messages to the Iraqi leader urging him to cooperate with United Nations inspectors. **********But even Mr. Mubarak, whose country played a leading role in the Persian Gulf war, went out of his way soon after Ms. Albright departed to announce that Egypt itself had no intention of joining in any renewed military action. And Syria, whose forces also joined prominently in the American-led gulf war coalition, has been so outspoken in its view that new attacks are unwarranted that Ms. Albright did not even stop in Damascus on her recent trip. **********Jordan, which backed Iraq during the gulf war, has switched sides since, even allowing American warplanes to use its territory as a base to enforce the ''no flight'' zone over southern Iraq. After meeting in London with Ms. Albright last weekend, King Hussein wrote a letter that he made public to prepare the country for the prospect that a new round of attacks may be ahead. **********But Jordan's Parliament replied with a statement that condemned ''any aggression against Iraq's territory and any harm that might come to the Iraqi people.'' **********Even in the gulf, within the tiny countries that Ms. Albright suggested should feel most threatened by Iraq, some commentators have tried to cast doubt on American claims of having won broad support for military action if diplomacy fails. **********''Albright's claims that she won significant Arab backing for the expected U.S. military operations against Iraq are most probably meant to embarrass the Arab sides and intimidate them to keep their mouths shut,'' Hafedh al-Sheik wrote last week in the Bahraini daily Akhbar al-Khalij."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/world/leading-dissident-is-freed-by-beijing-and-sent-to-us.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1998-04-19", "snippet": "China puts Wang Dan, its most noted dissident, on airplane bound for US after releasing him for medical reasons; Wang, leader of Tiananmen Square democracy movement, was arrested in May 1995 and was serving 11-year prison sentence; he is expected ...", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEADING DISSIDENT IS FREED BY BEIJING AND SENT TO U.S.", "print_headline": "LEADING DISSIDENT IS FREED BY BEIJING AND SENT TO U.S.", "body_text": " **********The Government of China today put Wang Dan, its most noted dissident, on an airplane bound for the United States after releasing him for medical reasons, according to the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, in Beijing. **********Mr. Wang, 28, was a leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, supressed by the Chinese military in 1989. He was accompanied on the flight to Detroit by an American diplomat, Mr. Wang's mother said. **********He was expected to be met by fellow dissidents in Detroit. **********His release was part of a negotiated arrangement reached last month between China and the Clinton Administration, in return for the United States' dropping its sponsorship of a resolution condemning China's human rights policies. **********A White House official reached early this morning said that the Administration was very pleased by the news, but that more would come from the President himself later today in Chile where he is attending a Western Hemisphere summit meeting. **********Mr. Wang served four years in prison for his role in the Tiananmen demonstrations. He was arrested again in May 1995 and was serving an 11-year sentence in a northeast China prison for ''subversion.'' **********American officials said that Mr. Wang had been moved to Beijing in the last few days, indicating that his release was likely. **********Mr. Wang's release paralleled that of another noted dissident, Wei Jingsheng, last Nov. 16. Mr. Wei was also released on medical grounds on condition that he, too, leave China and go into exile. **********Mr. Wei's release followed shortly after the summit meeting in Washington between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Mr. Wang's release comes just before Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visits China at the end of this month, preparing for Mr. Clinton's first trip to China as President in late June. **********The deal for Mr. Wang's release was first reported in The New York Times earlier this month.

The latitude in the accounting rules lets them write off advertising costs very gradually even when the bulk of the money is spent right as a film opens. **********In addition, revenues from sales of rerun rights to movies and television series can be recorded in full on the first day the products are available to run, even if a contract lasts three years or more. **********The result: A studio can make earnings look higher than they might really be by reducing near-term expenses and lifting sales. **********But last month, the group that oversees accounting procedures for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants approved a set of changes in film accounting that would compel companies to write off marketing costs faster than many do now. **********The changes would also prohibit studios from recognizing certain kinds of revenues as quickly as they once did. And the new rules would prevent companies from taking an exaggeratedly long period to write off film production costs. **********The rules face a series of additional hurdles, and have yet to be approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private group that determines the nation's accounting rules. But if, as expected, some variation of the current proposals is ultimately approved, it will go into effect in the year 2000. **********In the long term, both investors and analysts are expected to benefit because reported earnings will more accurately reflect performance, said David Londoner, a media analyst at Schroder Inc. and a member of the group that drafted the changes. Equally important, he added, the rules would create accounting uniformity that would make comparisons of companies easier. **********Ted Howell, chief financial officer at Sony Pictures Entertainment, said: ''Analysts want a level playing field. They don't see any reason why film accounting should be different than consumer products or other businesses.'' **********The proposed changes would be tougher on some companies than on others. Mr. Londoner said that the companies most likely to be affected by the changes were 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures and Paramount Pictures. These companies could face significant one-time write-downs if the new standards go into effect for accumulated advertising costs that are still carried in inventory. **********Mr. Londoner estimates that both Paramount, which is owned by Viacom, and Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star, which are owned by Sony, will have to take one-time $250 million write-offs. And 20th Century Fox, which is owned by the News Corporation, faces a $175 million write-down, he estimates. **********Simon Bax, chief financial officer at Fox Filmed Entertainment, said that the impact on that studio would depend on when the changes were adopted and how the films released in that period performed. Executives at Viacom and Sony declined to comment on Mr. Londoner's estimates. **********Two other studios, Time Warner's Warner Bros. and Seagram's Universal Pictures face relatively small write-downs, because they have used more conservative accounting methods, Mr. Londoner said. **********To be sure, because most studios are only parts of larger companies, any effect on the overall corporate bottom line would be muted. **********Studio executives have generally declined to comment publicly on the proposed rules. **********But privately, at least two have argued that it was unfair to force a speedier write-down of movie advertising costs. They said that even though advertising was concentrated during the time a film was in theaters, it was aimed at making a film more valuable later on, too, for release in other media. **********Though some of the major film studios have been aggressive in their accounting strategies, few have been as creative in this respect as a number of troubled smaller companies such as the now-defunct Carolco Pictures and Orion Pictures were in the 1980's when they sought to lift their earnings and keep investors happy. **********Facing a string of flops, they avoided the pain of losses by delaying write-offs for years. Among the tricks: they would forecast that a film that had bombed at the box office would make lots of money in television syndication or other media years after its release. **********Because movie companies have been able to write off expenses in proportion to projected revenues, when studios projected large future revenues they could stall writing off most of their current movie budgets for years. **********Ultimately, of course, many of those revenues never materialized, but companies still had heavy costs left on their books so they took huge one-time write-downs. ''People finally realized that the companies were not making money and had been borrowing against inflated inventories on their balance sheets,'' Mr. Londoner said. **********But even the more mainstream companies have used some techniques to maximize profits, strategies that likely will no longer be available. For example, studios have been able to write off advertising expenditures -- now $20 million a film, on average -- over more than 10 years in some cases. **********The new rules would require them to write off all marketing for the theatrical release of a movie in the initial three months. There would be equally strict parameters for when promotions for the home video and TV releases must be recorded. **********The new rules would also change the way studios could account for revenue from sales to television of the rights to movie or television series. Currently, when studios sell those rights, often for a multiyear period, they can reflect virtually all the revenues on the date the movie or series becomes available to television. The new rules would require that studios take in those revenues over the life of the contract. **********Currently, studios can take years to record production costs. That, too, will change. ''There will now be a cap of 10 years for the amount of time companies can project ultimate gross revenues,'' Dan Noll, technical manager for accounting at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said. ''That will force them to write off production costs over 10 years. The longer you can spread out the costs, the smaller the impact on the income statements.'' **********The origin of the accounting morass arises from changes in the movie business. ''The rules were written a long time ago and don't address how business is conducted today,'' Mr. Noll said. ''With home video, cable and television, the life of a film or series is far longer and it has left companies too much freedom to manage revenues and costs.'' **********Movie executives, Wall Street analysts and others will all have a chance to comment on the proposed rules. And though they may ultimately be altered, experts say there is a strong possibility that at least some tightening in film accounting policies is inevitable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/25/business/international-briefs-british-ge-siemens-joint-ventures-to-end.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-06-25", "snippet": "General Electric Co PLC and Siemens AG agree to end two British-based telecommunications joint ventures in transaction worth 700 million pounds ($1.17 billion); Siemens will be paid 610 million pounds in cash for its 40 percent stake in GPT, which...", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British G.E.-Siemens Joint Ventures to End", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; British G.E.-Siemens Joint Ventures to End", "body_text": " **********The General Electric Company P.L.C. and Siemens A.G., the two largest electronics companies in Britain and Germany, agreed yesterday to end two British-based telecommunications joint ventures in a transaction worth $:700 million ($1.17 billion) as they concentrate on different ends of the market. **********Siemens will be paid $:610 million in cash for its 40 percent stake in GPT, which makes telephone network switches.

Deep inside that bill, though, in a last-minute addition, the oil industry won a big concession: relief of $66 million from the amount owed for extracting oil from Federal lands. **********Then in October, with Congress wrangling over a huge spending bill and eager to cut deals and leave town, the oil industry won again as the House leadership reaffirmed that relief. Indeed, in the end, Congress even sweetened the deal a bit, by extending the break a little longer. **********Such is the power of Big Oil in Washington, and two of the biggest players in this monolithic and highly effective industry lobby are the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation. Rich in cash, aggressive in style, with issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes and the environment, they have been effective in pushing their agenda through behind-the-scenes contacts at the highest level of Government and through arm-twisting in Congress. **********''Some companies have a narrow range of interests to lobby on,'' said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks Washington lobbying. ''But, by its very nature, oil is so pervasive and it is so affected by Government policy that they care about everything.'' **********With the oil and gas industry generally marching, and lobbying, in lockstep, it is often hard to separate Exxon and Mobil from their rivals. While somewhat different in their approaches, both companies are big supporters of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association that spent $3.7 million on lobbying in 1997. They often join industry coalitions created to lobby about a specific topic -- the lifting of sanctions to oil-producing nations like Iraq, for example, or the ability of American oil companies to swap oil with Iran. **********By themselves, Exxon and Mobil have a combined total of 15 full-time lobbyists on their payrolls in Washington, and employ other Washington lawyers and lobbying firms as well. Last year, Mobil spent $5.3 million on Federal lobbying and Exxon spent $5.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Combined, this would make them the fifth-largest entity in spending on lobbying the Federal Government. **********As multinational corporations with businesses in far-flung spots, Exxon and Mobil's interests in Washington touch on many trade and finance issues. The two companies have won favorable tax rulings before the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department concerning the use of foreign tax credits to reduce their United States tax bill. **********They are sensitive to the State Department's Middle East and Asian policies, especially since oil is often found in pariah nations such as Libya, Myanmar and Iran. They are generally supportive of Arab nations. And new issues, like the proposed Caspian Sea pipeline route -- a region where Mobil has operations -- have engaged them. **********''They are probably most effective behind the scenes,'' said Martin Lobel, a Washington lawyer who represents consumer groups and small oil companies. ''They'll get their economists and lawyers to see the I.R.S. and the companies will stay relatively hidden. You've got maybe two Ph.D economists in the entire I.R.S. and Exxon can hire as many as they want. We were once in a big battle with Exxon on the issue of oil overcharges and there must have been 30 economists on the other side.'' **********Edward Rothschild, a senior associate with Podesta Associates, a Washington lobbying firm, said that the two companies' lobbying on complicated tax issues had paid off handsomely. **********''There's a lot of esoteric issues, especially in taxes, but which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ''There were efforts by the Clinton Administration in the last two budget bills to reduce the value of the foreign tax credits. But Exxon and the industry descended and those provisions were quietly eliminated. I don't know who they talked to, but they got the job done.'' **********While Exxon and Mobil are usually allied on industry issues, each has a different operating style: Exxon is more aloof and somewhat diffident about how it is perceived; Mobil is quicker to defend its public image and more willing to enter the political fray. Exxon's brashness was evident when the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, one of the worst environmental catastrophes in United States history, became a giant tax break, as the company wrote off all disaster-related expenses -- including legal bills and cleanup costs. **********Mobil makes few campaign contributions, while Exxon is a leading donor to the Republican Party and candidates. In the 1996 Presidential election cycle, Exxon contributed $593,928, donating 95 percent to Republicans; in the last Congressional races, Exxon gave $475,855, 84 percent to Republicans. **********This G.O.P. tilt could help the companies in the next Congress: the three new top House leaders are all Republicans from the Oil Patch: the House Speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana; the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, and J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's new conference chairman. **********On Capitol Hill, Exxon and Mobil opposed the Clinton Adminstration's efforts to gain Senate approval of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to curb global warming that had won support by other oil companies like Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum. **********And, in the last Congress, they won significant victories to halt the Interior and Treasury Departments' efforts to get oil companies to pay more in royalties for oil and gas extracted from Federal lands and pay back some $345.5 million in past royalties that the Interior Department says is owed. **********The Justice Department has even filed suit to collect these royalties; last August, Mobil spent $56.5 million to settle these claims. Meanwhile, in Congress, Exxon leads an industry effort to pay royalties owed to the Government in oil rather than in cash -- a proposal the Government strongly opposes. **********''The oil companies lobby in a very coordinated way,'' said a staff member for a House energy-related committee, who spoke on the condition that neither he not his committee be identified. ''They rely heavily on the American Petroleum Institute, but they've also got their people. Exxon's lobbyist is very friendly and outgoing and the company is really involved in the royalty issue.

Albright and Israeli and Palestinian leaders go as badly as American officials seem to expect, President Clinton will face some hard choices that could bring him into more open confrontation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. **********After a week of Middle East shuttling by the special American envoy, Dennis B. Ross, and an extra, post-midnight session early today at the Tel Aviv airport between Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Netanyahu, American officials continue to say they have little expectation for a breakthrough here. **********They suggest that despite all the American massaging of Mr. Netanyahu lately, especially around the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel, the Israeli leader is not prepared to accept the American proposals for a roughly 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank and that he thinks he can withstand any political pressure that might result from public American disapproval. **********''Secretary Albright is entering this meeting without any advanced knowledge that the key gaps are about to be closed,'' her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today. ''This is an extremely important meeting, and afterwards we'll decide what next steps to take.'' **********American officials deny that they would remove themselves from the search for peace. But if President Clinton approves, they could take steps to pressure Mr. Netanyahu or punish him, by publicly blaming him for the impasse or even suspending some American aid. **********While clearly intended to insulate Ms. Albright from accusations of failure after the talks Monday, Mr. Rubin's remarks also seemed to reflect genuine American pessimism and annoyance with the 14-month stalemate and the inability of Mr. Netanyahu to agree to American proposal, which Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has accepted in principle. **********The American proposals are intended to complete interim Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank, as called for in the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords, in stages, in return for Palestinian steps to counter terrorists. **********The proposals would commit both sides to begin accelerated talks on a final settlement between them, which under the Oslo agreements are to be completed by May 1999. **********Ms. Albright will meet separately here on Monday morning with Mr. Netanyahu at his hotel and later with Mr. Arafat at the American Embassy. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, as hosts and representing the European Union, will meet both Middle East leaders first. **********The main gaps between the Americans and the Israelis, the officials say, are the size of the redeployment, the security arrangements for the Palestinians and the sequence for final status negotiations in combination with a third and final Israeli withdrawal, which Mr. Netanyahu says he wants to forgo. **********Today in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu's spokesman, David Bar-Ilan, said that ''it would be utterly impossible for Israel to adhere to a withdrawal of 13 percent,'' but that Israel was hoping for ''some incremental progress'' on such issues as a Palestinian airport and seaport in the Gaza Strip and an industrial park on the Israel-Gaza border. **********But Mr. Rubin said that the Americans ''are interested in the views of Mr. Netanyahu'' and that the focus of the London meeting is the American agenda, ''not the airport.'' **********Mr. Arafat, who met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Cairo today before coming to London tonight, said that success depended on Mr. Netanyahu and warned that ''we will not agree to a withdrawal of less than 13 percent'' and that ''the failure of the conference will lead to anarchy and violence.'' **********The Palestinians currently control about 27 percent of the West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. **********Mr. Netanyahu says publicly that he cannot, on security grounds, hand over more than another 9 percent before final status talks begin, but has privately told Mr. Clinton he might be able to yield 11 percent. **********But American officials do not think Mr. Arafat could politically accept much less than 13 percent, even though, under the 1997 Hebron accords, Washington recognized Israel's right to determine the size of its redeployments under Oslo. **********The American proposal, never publicly revealed but widely leaked, calls for a three-stage withdrawal in which 13 percent of the West Bank now under complete Israeli control would come under full or partial Palestinian control. **********In the first five weeks, Israel would hand over to the Palestinians 1.9 percent from Area C (West Bank land under complete Israeli control) to Area B (land under Palestinian political control but with security under Israeli control). Israel would also hand over 0.1 percent from Area C to Area A (land under complete Palestinian control). Israel would also hand over 7 percent from Area B to Area A. **********In return, Mr. Arafat would order a ban on all kinds of ''incitement'' to violence in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian Executive Committee would reconfirm changes in the Palestinian Covenant by canceling all clauses calling for Israel's destruction. **********From the 6th to the 11th week, Israel would hand over another 5 percent from land under complete Israeli control to political, but not security, control by the Palestinians -- from Area C to Area B. Mr. Arafat would hand over a full list of Palestinian policemen, which currently exceed Oslo limits on their numbers. **********A security committee of both sides, with the Americans included, would discuss Israeli accusations of weapons smuggling to the Palestinians. A similar committee led by the Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, and the Israeli Cabinet chief, Danny Naveh, and including the Americans would discuss mutual demands to extradite suspects in terrorist acts and how to approve the release from jail of Palestinian suspects. **********In the 12th week, presuming both sides meet their obligations, Israel would hand over another 5 percent of the West Bank from Area C (total Israeli control) to B (partial Palestinian control). It would hand over another 1 percent from Area C to A (total Palestinian control). It would also transfer another 5 percent from Area B to A. And both sides would begin accelerated negotiations on a final settlement between them, to be finished before next May. **********So in the end, 13 percent would be transferred from Area C, and Area B would remain, after shifts of land to A, at 23 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/27/technology/the-art-of-driving-is-all-the-rage.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-08-27", "snippet": "World Wide Web sites are devoted to all aspects of automotive experience; road rage has triggered number of sites set up to record license plates; one site, called How to Drive Like a Moron, sarcastically compiles every possible bad-driving habit ...", "word_count": 385, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Art of Driving Is All the Rage", "print_headline": "The Art of Driving Is All the Rage", "body_text": " **********ONCE you have come to terms with the number of computers inside your car, try looking at the number of cars on your computer -- Web sites devoted to just about all aspects of the automotive experience.

Or because of his father, who sailed in the merchant marine. Or his childhood in Puerto Rico spent yearning for snow. For whatever reason, Rick Werner really wants to climb Mount Everest. **********So despite his asthma and the fact that he hasn't hiked much higher than Mount Washington (elevation 6,288 feet) in New Hampshire, Mr. Werner, 31, will spend a month's vacation this year and whatever else it takes to prepare to climb the world's highest mountain in 2000. **********''It becomes sort of an obsession,'' said Mr. Werner, an Internet account manager for Bell Atlantic in Arlington, Va. ''You begin to feel the gravitational pull of this big rock.'' **********Join the crowd. Despite a dozen deaths on Everest in the 1996 climbing season, demand remains strong for commercial guided expeditions to the 29,028-foot peak. **********In light of a death rate of about one climber for every four who reach the top, some believe that only the most seasoned climbers should attempt the summit. But for those with the compulsion to stand on the roof of the world, access can be had, for a price. **********The leading expedition services now charge about $65,000 a client. And that does not include the air fare to Nepal or a climber's cold-weather gear. Also not included: a guarantee of success. **********The fee does include the necessary permits, food, Sherpas to carry gear and access to group gear like tents and cookstoves -- as well as the aid of guides to assist in an ascent. **********The very first step on the long walk is choosing a guide service. It helps to know what questions to ask. **********For a start, Todd Burleson, president and owner of Alpine Ascents International in Seattle, said to ask guides how many people they have taken to the summit -- his group has assisted 35 climbers who reached the top of Everest since 1990 -- as well as whether they have lost anyone. And ask to speak with 10 clients from previous Everest expeditions. ''If they can't do that, you begin to wonder who you're calling,'' he said. **********Gordon Janow, program director of Alpine Ascents, suggested that clients look deeper than the success ratio of summits to attempts. ''Are you turning people around in bad weather? Were your high-success days all in really good weather? What's your success rate in bad weather?'' **********Mr. Burleson said that the trend was toward private groups, in which a few climbers buy out an entire expedition; instead of taking eight clients, a guide service will take three or so, who pay from $150,000 to $200,000 each. Indeed, that's the only kind of expedition he will handle for now. **********Suz Kelly, a spokeswoman for Adventure Consultants Ltd. of New Zealand, said other factors to consider included the client-to-guide ratio and the overall group size. And climbers need to know what kind of base camp services are provided. She recommends asking if it has weather forecasting facilities, a doctor on the staff, and satellite communications for backup. **********Even after Rob Hall, Adventure Consultants' founder, died on the mountain in 1996, eight members of a group organized by the company reached the top last May. **********Dave McGovern, a guide with Mountain Madness, also of Seattle, said that beyond the particulars of an expedition's supplies and a company's track record, a prospective client should learn more about the guides than their climbing resumes. ''A lot of guides are 26 years old and have four 8,000-meter peaks under their belts,'' he said. ''Twenty-six is kind of young, so the bells start to go off.'' **********Look for compassion and sensitivity, Mr. McGovern said.'''Are they a parent, have they had any heartbreaks? Has the person dealt with issues of humanity, rather than just being a climbing jock? So many guides up there have had a lot of quick successes.'' **********Expedition companies are also demanding more of clients. Mountain Madness, which lost its founder, Scott Fischer, in the 1996 climb, now requires a client to participate in at least one of its other trips before going to Everest. In addition, it advises prospective Everest climbers to take its six-day high-altitude course on Mount Baker in Washington, then climb a volcano in Mexico or Ecuador or one of the shorter Himalayas. **********The company suggests, but does not require, that clients climb Denali in Alaska, or Aconcagua in Argentina -- the highest peaks, respectively, in North and South America -- as well as an 8,000-meter (26,246 feet) peak, before trying Everest. In the summer of 1999, a Mountain Madness group will take on such a peak, Gasherbrum 2, in Kashmir. **********An issue for both guides and clients is a willingness to bail out. That is crucial for clients who may have paid a year's salary and suffered through thin air, pounding headaches and grueling exercise only to be turned back within sight of the summit. **********Mr. Janow said: ''There's that really delicate balance of when to tell someone, 'This trip is over; you're not able to continue,' versus when to see if the client is just really tired and needs someone pushing them. It's sort of a thin line. You have to see if you can pinpoint those things when picking a guide.'' **********Mr. Werner has decided to choose Mountain Madness, in part, he said, because of the 1996 tragedy. **********''I have a good degree of confidence in this group, because they were touched by that and they have a good amount of people with alpine experience,'' he said. ''I think they take fewer chances, and would send you down the mountain if you were 10 feet away from the summit, if they had to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/11/business/company-news-utilicorp-raises-stake-in-new-zealand-power-company.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-09-11", "snippet": "Utilicorp United Inc will pay $206 million to increase its stake in Power New Zealand Ltd; Utilicorp will increase its ownership to 78.6 percent from 37.5 percent; will buy shares from Mercury Energy Ltd and WEL Energy Group Ltd (S)", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UTILICORP RAISES STAKE IN NEW ZEALAND POWER COMPANY", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; UTILICORP RAISES STAKE IN NEW ZEALAND POWER COMPANY", "body_text": " **********Utilicorp United Inc., the sixth-largest electric utility in the United States, said yesterday that it would pay $206 million to increase its stake in Power New Zealand Ltd., ending a four-year battle for control of the New Zealand electric company.

Thomas Jr., Kenneth Fadner and W. Pendleton Tudor -- who bought and merged three regional trade publications known as ANNY, for Advertising News of New York; SAM, for Serving Advertising in the Midwest, and MAC on the West Coast, for Media Agencies Clients. Editions for New England, the South and the Southwest were added later. **********The executives' experience at magazines like Esquire, Life, New York and Time influenced the decision to have Adweek behave more like a consumer publication than a traditional trade paper. That was reinforced by a splashy design by Walter Berhard, who, Mr. Thomas recalled, suggested the name and produced the ''wonderful red'' cover logo in a type face, Ankzeiden Grotesque, that ''just jumps out at you.'' **********Ms. Fahey and Sid Holt, editor in chief of Adweek, demurred when asked to identify the industry leaders who would not pose for photographs with their former colleagues. **********The only ''group to say no,'' according to Ms. Fahey, was ''the brothers.'' That was of course a reference to Maurice and Charles Saatchi of Saatchi & Saatchi and M&C Saatchi, who ''just kind of said 'Happy anniversary' and very politely declined,'' she said. **********Adweek editors chose the 20 campaigns, Mr. Holt said, based on attributes like creativity, effectiveness and longevity. The best showing was made by the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of the Omnicom Group and its predecessor agencies, which landed four campaigns on the list, for Absolut vodka, Apple Computer, Energizer batteries and the Nynex Yellow Pages. **********Tied in second place, with two campaigns apiece, were the Publicis & Hal Riney unit of Publicis S.A., for Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers and Saturn automobiles, and Wieden & Kennedy, for ESPN ''Sports Center'' and Nike Inc. **********Now that Adweek has celebrated its 20th anniversary, does Advertising Age intend to publish a 70th anniversary issue in 2000? **********''None planned,'' replied Scott Donaton, the New York-based editor of Advertising Age, owned by Crain Communications Inc. There are plans for two special issues next year, he added, one retrospective titled ''The Advertising Century'' and the other a forward-looking millennium issue. **********Perhaps that issue will assess whether the future will bring what the Wolf Group is predicting in an ad in the special Adweek. The ad presents the front cover of Adweek from Nov. 24, 2018, reporting Wolf winning accounts from General Motors, Microsoft and Pepsi-Cola, including brands like ''Pepsi Lite, Pepsi Phat, Pepsi Day and Pepsi Night.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/05/business/costco-expands-in-korea.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-05-05", "snippet": "Costco Companies agrees to buy three membership warehouse clubs from Shinsegae Department Store Co of South Korea for about $94 million, expanding discount retailer into that country (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Costco Expands in Korea", "print_headline": "Costco Expands in Korea", "body_text": " **********The Costco Companies agreed today to buy three membership warehouse clubs from the Shinsegae Department Store Company of South Korea for about $94 million, expanding the discount retailer into that country.

Those efforts are emblematic of ambitious steps being taken by giant agencies to increase their value to clients and fend off attempts by strategic consulting companies -- and the clients themselves -- to perform functions that Madison Avenue has traditionally handled. **********Susan Gianinno, who abruptly left the J. Walter Thompson Company unit of WPP Group on Oct. 30, will join D.M.B.& B., effective Monday, in the new positions of executive vice president, global marketing director and chief branding officer. Ms. Gianinno, 48, had been chief executive of the flagship New York office of Thompson until she suddenly departed ''by mutual consent,'' as her exit was tersely described, after clashing with top management on operational, staffing and personality issues. **********The agency industry has been eagerly watching to see what would become of Ms. Gianinno, who has also held high-level posts at shops like the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group and Young & Rubicam Advertising. Ms. Gianinno, who will also serve on the board of D.M.B.& B., becomes the highest-ranking woman at that agency, which has billings of more than $7.5 billion from multinational clients like the Coca-Cola Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Procter & Gamble Company. **********''The fundamental thing we're all about is building brand leaders,'' Arthur Selkowitz, chairman and chief executive of D.M.B.& B., said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''The way to do that is to have a superior understanding of the consumer, which leads to better, fresher, more powerful creative work that ultimately builds brands.'' **********''Agencies, particularly during economic downturns, have cut back in the area of the strategic understanding of the consumer,'' he added, ''and risk abdicating that to clients and to consulting firms.'' **********Indeed, D.M.B.& B. in March wooed a top executive from one such firm, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, to serve as vice chairman and director for worldwide strategic planning and business development. That executive, Sam Hill, 44, who had been chief marketing officer at Booz-Allen, now takes the titles of vice chairman and chief strategic officer at D.M.B.& B., responsible for operations that include leadership strategy, which concentrates on how brands become leaders; consumer analyses, the strategic analysis of demographic groups and markets, and knowledge management, the realm of research and information services. **********Mr. Hill will continue to report to Mr. Selkowitz. Some of Mr. Hill's duties are being shifted to Ms. Gianinno, who will report to Mr. Selkowitz for parts of her job and to John Farrell, president at D.M.B.& B. North America, for others. **********''It has been a really interesting several weeks,'' said Ms. Gianinno, who joined Mr. Selkowitz for the interview, as she weighed opportunities with agencies, advertisers and the entertainment industry. **********''I have to say that I came away from that most excited about the potential that exists within agencies,'' she added, ''particularly this one, to apply consumer knowledge and insights to brand-building and the creative process.'' **********That reflects a refocusing of agencies' attentions from consumer attitudes to consumer behavior, which is examined with methods not unlike those used by detectives or anthropologists. For instance, account planners can videotape shoppers visiting a mall, explore teen-agers' closets to study apparel preferences or even ask consumers to create collages illustrating what a brand would look like if it were a person. **********''I've been fortunate to work on consumer insights from a number of different angles,'' said Ms. Gianinno, who is by training a behavioral psychologist, ''whether leading an agency, running worldwide accounts or branding and planning.'' **********''Clients are desperate for usable consumer knowledge,'' she added, ''and agencies are best equipped to make that happen.'' **********In another appointment involving the Strategic Consulting Group, Daniel Dahan, chief executive at D.M.B.& B.

Paul Correale noticed the elderly woman in black with the toddler when the two turned to watch his patrol from 50 feet or so away. The child waved a tiny, pink-mittened hand in greeting. **********The sergeant, 34, is a specialist in armed reconnaissance who describes what his training entailed this way: ''They tell us to go out and get information on the enemy so the main force can kill them.'' And that is what he is expected to do in Bosnia if the NATO-led peacekeeping mission deteriorates into combat. **********But, with that pink mitten waving back and forth, his patrol stopped while the sergeant, laughing, ran over to grasp the child's hand. **********''I'm doing what I'm doing for the kids here,'' he said afterward. ''I think the Bosnians are the hardest working, most decent people I've ever seen.'' **********The United States Army has worried about this sort of thing. Senior American officers in Bosnia spent much of the last two years telling their subordinates not to let soldiers get emotionally involved in what they were doing here. There was too high a risk that Western efforts would fail, the officers said, and if the soldiers cared too much about the country their morale might collapse along with the peace. **********But it seems too late for such concerns. To a considerable extent, American forces have gone from dispassionate observers in a confusing land to soldiers who feel their job is to help people they now know and like. **********Senior officers now say it may be better for the Army if the soldiers feel an emotional association with Bosnians. **********Soldiers get constant reinforcement from Bosnians who tell them it is good that the Americans are here.  Psychological screenings of soldiers leaving the danger, discomfort and loneliness of long tours in Bosnia find that the troops feel better about themselves and their jobs than the average American does, according to Army psychologists. **********An immediate benefit for the Army is that soldiers who have been assigned to Bosnia are more likely to re-enlist than others, officers say. This year the re-enlistment rates for some Army units in Europe, from which most the soldiers in Bosnia have come, are more than 50 percent higher than their goals, the Army says. **********In this town there was another statistic to note: The number of times per minute Bosnians smiled and greeted the American patrol. **********As they walked the frozen streets at the bottom of a cup-shaped valley where the mountains, the pine trees and the sky were uniformly white with snow and haze, most of the American soldiers spoke optimistically of their work. **********They did not dwell on the factories destroyed by shelling or the large number of refugees here who are barred from returning to their homes because the country remains splintered along ethnic lines. Instead, the men in this patrol noted the rebuilt homes and hospital. **********Their view of success comes in part from the limited view of their responsibilities expressed by the Army. Their orders do not include having them hunt down indicted war crimes suspects who still powerfully influence politics, although NATO troops are authorized to arrest suspects if security conditions allow.  Nor are they supposed to insure that the victims of so-called ethnic cleansing return to their homes. **********While a fractured Bosnia, brim-full with the unemployed, the homeless and the angry and governed by politicians who will not work together, may yet blow apart, the soldiers are told their work is going well. **********Many of the 8,500 Americans soldiers in Bosnia believe that since their deployment after the December 1995 Dayton accords, they have enforced a peace that is allowing civilian and international agencies to begin rebuilding a country many of them have come to like. **********Walking next to the rebuilt Olovo hospital, fresh plaster on the outside and warm clinics filled with children and their mothers inside, Capt. Dan McIntosh, who commands an armored cavalry company, said: ''Think of what that means to a community to lose its only hospital. And then, we help open it up. That is something. Our soldiers set the conditions for that.'' **********The executive officer of Captain McIntosh's company, First Lieut. Daniel Fickel, 25, of Miami, said his father tells him that what he is doing in Bosnia now is similar to what his father did earlier in the Peace Corps. **********''We're really helping people,'' Lieutenant Fickel said. ''You can't  send soldiers halfway around the world to save a country and then say don't get emotionally involved.'' **********Though the American Army policy has been to insist all three ethnic groups -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- be treated exactly the same, many soldiers feel that the Muslims, who have the highest number of displaced in Bosnia now, suffered the most during the 1992-95 war. Nearly everyone in Bosnia is relieved the fighting has stopped, but Muslims are convinced the West stopped a war of annihilation that was directed against them, and probably feel especially appreciative toward the peacekeepers. **********But with Western governments pressing Bosnian authorities to carry out terms of the peace agreement, there have been times when the NATO-led forces, including Americans, have met violence. **********The worst case for the Americans was in August, when troops tried to install a more cooperative police commander in Brcko in the Bosnian Serb-controlled area and mobs organized by local Serbian authorities blocked the attempt. Civilians attacked American soldiers with stones and gasoline bombs. **********Despite such incidents, relations between most Bosnians and American troops have been good. **********In Olovo, a town named for the lead mined here since Roman times and now inhabited mostly by Muslims, Sergeant Correale seems to have found a place he likes. **********Displaying considerable knowledge of medieval Bosnian history, Sergeant Correale, of Huber Heights, Ohio, pointed out a citadel-like building poking through the snow halfway up a mountain and explained that it was one of two centuries-old Roman Catholic monasteries in the area. He added that, based on his reading in the five months since he came here, he has come to doubt the theory that the recent fighting in Bosnia was an inevitable continuation of longstanding ethnic antagonisms. **********It is easier now for soldiers to study history and become acquainted with Bosnians than it was in January 1996, when the American troops fought rain, blizzards and a churning Sava River to enter this country. Then, everything was arduous, everywhere was dangerous and living conditions were terrible. **********But as political tensions have eased and the Army has become accustomed to working in Bosnia, the soldier's life here has improved. **********Even so, soldiers raised questions that senior officers say trouble them as well. **********''I think we are doing good, but it is taking a lot out of everyone,'' said Sgt. Sabrina Pinkard, a medical technician from Columbus, Ohio, who is based at Camp Gentry, a rather isolated base on the northern edge of the American sector. **********Referring to the Army's downsizing and the increase in overseas deployments in recent years, she said, ''If our unit keeps getting sent places, here or wherever, with no time to rest and catch up, we are going to wear out.'' **********''She's right,'' said Pvt. David Quinn, also with the Second Cavalry Regiment. Thinking about the stress on soldiers who are separated from their families, he said, ''We got our own trouble back home, too.'' **********Soldiers say what makes them think their mission is worthwhile is the balance between the personal burden and the task at hand. In Bosnia, they are getting extra pay and bonuses. Many feel that are sharpening their military skills. And life on their bases, though still difficult, has become less uncomfortable. **********At Camp Demi in north-central Bosnia, where the soldiers patrolling the town of Olovo are based, a dinner last week offered choices of 6 entrees including pretty tasty burritos, 6 vegetables, 12 kinds of salad and 8 desserts. **********Talk around the base was about how the Army has settled in in Bosnia. The mission has gone from short and arduous to something of indefinite length that has become part of the Army's life. **********Soldiers said they were not at all surprised by President Clinton's recent announcement that there is no longer a deadline to withdraw the troops from Bosnia. It seemed clear, many thought, that Bosnia was going to be an assignment to be rotated among combat units for some time. **********''I guess it's going to be somewhere between like what we did in Haiti and what we're doing in Korea,'' said Specialist Jason Suddeth, 21 from Galesburg, Ill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/17/business/company-news-hoechst-and-kohlberg-kravis-halt-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-10-17", "snippet": "Hoechst AG and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co end talks on Kohlberg Kravis's purchase of Hoechst's paint unit called Herberts (S)1", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOECHST AND KOHLBERG KRAVIS HALT TALKS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HOECHST AND KOHLBERG KRAVIS HALT TALKS", "body_text": " **********Hoechst A.G., Europe's No. 4 chemical maker, and the United States buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company ended talks on Kohlberg Kravis's purchase of Hoechst's paint unit.

War Crimes Tribunal Steps Up Its Inquiry Into Kosovo", "body_text": " **********The United Nations war crimes tribunal is stepping up its investigations of war crimes in the Serbian province of Kosovo. **********The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has assembled a team of investigators, lawyers and military analysts to focus exclusively on Kosovo, tribunal officials said. Members of that team have made their first fact-finding mission to the area and are scheduled to go again soon. **********The investigators have instructions to identify the people responsible for the ongoing shelling and torching of civilian areas in Kosovo. And they are examining accounts that numerous civilians, most of them ethnic Albanians, have been kidnapped and killed in circumstances that cannot be defined as military combat. **********In recent weeks, thanks to additional United Nations funds earmarked for Kosovo, the tribunal has been able to hire about a dozen new experts. ''Kosovo is definitely one of our priorities,'' said Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor. ''We are doing all we can, collecting information, assembling cases and drawing up plans for indictments.'' **********Mr. Blewitt added that the tribunal was looking into war crimes by both parties in the conflict, a comment that seemed to address the frequent charges from Serbia that the tribunal was anti-Serb. **********''Our investigation involves not just Serbs but also the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' he said. ''There are allegations of war crimes on both sides.'' **********Since the conflict in Kosovo began early this year, the United Nations Security Council, which created the tribunal, has maintained that the court's jurisdiction includes Kosovo. The tribunal's chief prosecutor has repeated the point in the face of Serbian claims that events in the province of Kosovo are an internal affair. The tribunal was created in 1993 to prosecute war crimes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. This jurisdiction is ongoing and has no expiration date. **********The dispute over war crimes, even as they are going on, once again raises the question of the purpose of the tribunal and whether it can fulfill its role to help heal war wounds and act as a deterrent. The six trials now going at The Hague involve war crimes from Bosnia and Croatia.  Seen from The Hague, where high-minded principles of international law are repeated in the quiet corridors and courtrooms, the events in Kosovo are remote. The horror of the refugees and of distant burning villages is hard to fathom. Human rights activists, aid workers and military observers report that 240,000 people, perhaps one-tenth of the population, have been left homeless by the Serbian drive to secure Kosovo from rebels who are fighting for independence. **********However remote the court may be from Kosovo, some tribunal officials believe it has made a difference. **********''We got more reports of atrocities, of summary executions, kidnappings and murders by the Serb police earlier this year,'' one senior official said. ''There's obviously still a lot of suffering and destruction. But we're not getting as much evidence of atrocities in the past few months since the prosecutor made it clear that the tribunal is involved.'' **********It would be hard to prove, he said, ''but it is possible that the prosecutor's several warnings have lessened the crimes.'' **********''It is also possible,'' he added, ''that the Serb military who got more involved from June onward had different instructions.'' **********Investigators are looking into war crimes such as mistreatment of civilians and prisoners of war along with arbitrary arrests, torture and killing, all of which are not related to direct military actions. **********''As bloody and messy and violent as war is, we need to establish there was criminal action,'' one official close to the investigation said. ''If the Serb army is trying to retake an area, the mere fact of shelling or bombing does not make the actions into war crimes.'' **********''But the wanton destruction of a village that is not a military target, where there are no military objectives or soldiers present, that is a war crime,'' he said. **********Drawing lessons from their slow progress in investigating war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, prosecutors have changed strategy in their work on Kosovo. **********Mr. Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor, said that in Kosovo investigators would focus on people in positions of authority, ''the people who made things happen or who could prevent them from happening.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/18/business/manhattan-law-firm-in-european-merger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-18", "snippet": "Christy & Viener, a Manhattan law firm of about 70 lawyers, is merging with Salans Hertzfeld & Heilbronn, European law firm, in first trans-Atlantic law firm merger; partners of firms say merger will create firm of nearly 300 lawyers; when merger ...", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manhattan Law Firm in European Merger", "print_headline": "Manhattan Law Firm in European Merger", "body_text": " **********Christy & Viener, a Manhattan law firm of about 70 lawyers, is merging with Salans Hertzfeld & Heilbronn, a European law firm, in the first trans-Atlantic law firm merger. **********Partners of the firms said yesterday that the merger, creating a firm of nearly 300 lawyers, would help them serve global companies. **********''In times of uncertainty, clients seek out law firms with longstanding experience and expertise in different markets,'' said James S.

In 1981, in his maiden speech in Parliament, he became the first man ever to speak there without wearing a necktie. Late one beer-fueled night, according to an often-told story, he stopped by to rattle the gates of the Chancellery, and to shout, ''I want in there!'' **********But the higher he rose and the older he got, the less rambunctious he became. He grew to admire the United States, he says. As premier of Germany's second largest and third most populous state for the last eight years, he as been the consummate pragmatist, cooperating with or disregarding the left-wing party hierarchy according to his purposes. He not only started wearing neckties, he took to smoking fine Havana cigars and sporting clothes designed by Armani. **********He got so chummy with business executives that trade unionists and other ideological stalwarts in his party started mocking him as ''der Genosse von Bossen'' -- the comrade of the bosses. **********Now the Social Democrats, who have failed three times to oust Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have turned to Gerhard Schroder to do the job in a national election on Sept. 27. Handsome, telegenic, a ferocious worker, Mr. Schroder, 54, is almost a generation younger than Mr. Kohl, who is 68. Not by accident, he is running a media-savvy campaign as ambiguous and devoid of specifics as those that brought Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to power in Britain and the United States. **********Mr. Schroder must grapple with the problem that has confronted left-wing politicians throughout Europe as well as the Democrats in the United States: big government has become too costly. **********Partly because of the huge expenditures in eastern Germany after reunification, partly because of the competition with countries that have learned to live with less, Germany can no longer afford the restrictive labor laws, ample pensions and generous health care system with which Mr. Schroder's party has been identified. ''There is no more West German island,'' said a Western diplomat here.  ''Germany has to live by the same rules as the rest of us, which means cutting back. That's the real dilemma for Schroder and his party.'' **********A victory would make Mr. Schroder one of Europe's most powerful men, standing at the helm of the continent's dominant economic and political power. It would also constitute an unprecedented accomplishment in modern German history; no sitting Chancellor has been defeated by a candidate of another party since the federal republic was established in 1949. **********The polls put him ahead, but only by a slender margin, with a sizable undecided vote. Germany is accustomed to a more carnivorous, less image-oriented politics, with plenty of ideological meat to chew on, and people are starting to grumble. **********''You can't quite get hold of him,'' said Josef Joffe, editorial page editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung of Munich, one of the country's major newspapers. ''He was given the nod very grudgingly by the party bosses, who stand well to his left, because they were convinced he was the only one with a chance to win. So he tries to placate the left wing of his party and to win over the swing voters at the same time.'' **********''He obfuscates, prevaricates and says as little as possible.'' **********Michael Naumann, the German-born New York publisher whom Mr. Schroder has recruited as a potential culture minister, takes a different view. He sees Mr. Schroder as a man who has the capacity to answer a national craving, ''to fill this big psychological hole at the center of German life, the need to define what we live for in the midst of our amazing material well-being.'' **********Above all, he has a fresh face.  Mr. Kohl has been Chancellor for 16 years, as long as Franklin D. Roosevelt would have served as President had he not died in office. Mr. Schroder has apparently concluded that the electorate is tired of Mr. Kohl but resistant to a major deviation from his policies. So he talks, in pure Clintonese, of ''a New Middle.'' **********Recognizing Limits To Welfare State **********In mid-August, on the day before he announced his party's election program, Mr. Schroder sat down for an interview at the party's striking steel-and-glass headquarters, Willy Brandt Haus, in the heart of the new Berlin. **********''The welfare state has reached its limits,'' he said, sitting at a table covered with the detritus typical of campaigns everywhere -- half-eaten sandwiches and empty coffee cups. ''We won't be able to increase payments.'' **********You could almost hear the echo of Bill Clinton's voice proclaiming the era of big government over. **********But like generations of liberal politicians eager to sound a note of fiscal responsibility, Mr. Schroder insisted that by closing ''a labyrinth of tax loopholes,'' he could roll back the small welfare cuts made by Mr. Kohl and still cut income taxes. ''It's not that much of a riddle,'' he said. **********An engaging man with a large head, a boldly cut jaw and the beefy body of a former linebacker, Mr. Schroder spoke quietly but gestured vigorously with his squarish hands, waving a pair of half-moon spectacles as he talked.  His eyes are his most notable feature -- ice blue under fair, bushy brows and unwelcoming until he laughs, which he does often, in private as well as on the stump. **********''I've had to give up the old Hegelian idea that when theory and reality clash, reality is wrong,'' he said, apropos of his move to the middle. ''Reality is often right.'' **********Asked whether he feared that Mr. Kohl would try to discredit him by talking about the radicalism of his youth, Mr. Schroder responded, ''I don't think so. As you see, the revolution I planned didn't take place, so there's no point in bringing up what I said then.'' **********He added, in a paraphrase of what he said at Georgetown University earlier this year: ''Learning is the essence of politics. You should never trust politicians who think they have nothing left to learn any more.'' **********But Mr. Schroder predicted that his opponents might try to discredit him by talking about his private life, although Germans, he said, were less interested in scandal and gossip ''than you Americans or even the British.'' **********Mr. Schroder has been married four times. The first marriage lasted 3 years, the second 9 and the third 12, breaking up bitterly two years ago. When he eloped with Doris Kopf, a journalist from Bavaria, the spurned third wife, Hiltrud Hamel, called him ''a coward, an opportunist and an egotist.'' **********Although the Christian Democratic leaders have refrained so far from personal criticism, the party's youth group has produced a brochure that tackles the marriage issue. ''Schroder is a bad choice,'' it says. ''Three women couldn't be wrong.'' **********In another indirect assault, the owner of a big German car-rental company called Sixt is running a magazine advertisement that shows two pictures of Mr. Schroder, one looking left and the other looking right. ''Sixt,'' the caption declares, ''has cars for people who don't know where they want to go.'' **********One of the biggest questions about Mr. Schroder's destination is who would help him get there. It appears highly unlikely that the Social Democrats will gain a clear majority, even if they win, so he would need a coalition partner.  There are two possibilities -- an alliance with the Greens or teaming up with the Christian Democrats in the kind of grand coalition Germany had under Kurt Georg Kiesinger from 1966 to 1969. **********When his visitor suggested that a coalition with the often erratic Greens would make more sense in the party context, because they are more ideologically compatible, but a grand coalition would make more sense in a governmental context because of greater stability Mr. Schroder agreed. Then he added, with a malicious little grin:  ''There's an old saying in this country: If you want to be successful, think first of your country, then of your party.'' **********Whose old saying? he was asked. **********''Mine,'' he answered. **********But the decision will not be his alone. Parties matter more in German politics than in the United States, and Mr. Schroder does not yet control his party. Oskar Lafontaine, the party leader, is giving stout backing to Mr. Schroder for now, though he looked noticeably jumpy recently as Mr. Schroder announced the party program.  Many people wonder what he will do once the ballots have been counted, and the Christian Democrats are trying to play on that, suggesting that it would be the party bosses rather than Mr. Schroder who would call the ideological tune in choosing a partner and framing Government policy. **********Trying to Emulate Clinton and Blair **********Mr. Schroder tries to equate himself to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair. But the parallel is inexact.  Each of them took office having already won the main ideological arguments within his own party, and Mr. Schroder, if he wins, would become Chancellor with important questions still unresolved. **********For example, Mr. Lafontaine, a harsh critic of ''billionaire capitalists,'' wants to cut the top income tax rate from 53 percent to 49, while Mr. Schroder wants to bring it down to 45. Mr. Schroder sometimes emphasizes a ''modern'' Germany that shines in new technology, as when he named Jost Stillman, a businessman, as an economic adviser; other times he attacks the pension reform and labor flexibility that modernizers consider mandatory. **********Nor is it clear, despite tens of thousands of words and endless columns of analysis in the newspapers, exactly what Mr. Schroder would do to attack unemployment, one of Germany's most serious and intractable problems. **********The party platform says a Schroder Government would expect labor unions to permit ''the more flexible organization of work.'' Business, it continues, needs to invest more, innovate more and provide more apprenticeships. The Government itself, it says, needs to shrink the bureaucracy and increase public spending on research. **********It promises a ''crash program'' to fight joblessness among the young by bringing 100,000 unemployed young people into training programs. **********But the nuts and bolts of the program are still missing. Persuading labor and business to work together, devising practical programs and finding the money to pay for them would be the job of Walter Riester, the highly regarded 54-year-old deputy chairman of the powerful metalworkers' union, who has been designated as the labor-minister-to-be in a Schroder Government. **********One thing seems plain: with Mr. Schroder as Chancellor, Germany will remain a firm ally of the United States. Diplomats from both countries seem sure of this, as do officials Mr. Schroder met during his recent trip to Washington. **********Sometimes he stretches a point to dramatize his conversion from anti-American views. He tells people that ''my daughter was born in New York,'' when in fact she is his stepdaughter by his fourth marriage, and until 1997, he had not visited the United States in more than 15 years. **********But there is no doubt that Mr. Schroder admires Mr. Clinton's political style, especially his success in repositioning himself and his party. Mr. Schroder has embraced issues like crime that the Christian Democrats long dominated. He has even hired Hank Sheinkopf, a Clinton adviser in 1996, to help with instant rebuttal and research on the opposition. **********In the conversation at the party headquarters, Mr. Schroder said that despite an all-party agreement that Germany will not commit military forces abroad except on a United Nations mandate, he could not conceive of Germany holding back from intervening in the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo if the United Nations was silent and other European nations wanted to act. That would please the United States, which has long felt that the Europeans have been too slow to police their own turf. **********In a long career, Mr. Schroder, who is known as Gerd, has managed to find a way forward when others might well have felt stymied. **********He had no more promising a start in life than Bill Clinton. His father, a conscript, was killed during the retreat from Russia when Mr. Schroder was only three days old, and his mother raised him alone while working as a cleaning woman. He dropped out of school at 14, went to night school and ended up studying law at Gottingen University during the turbulence of 1968. **********These days, Mr. Schroder handles hecklers, commonplace in German politics, with great aplomb. Asked how he learned, he replied, ''By heckling.'' **********Climbing the Rungs Of the Political Ladder **********After a stint as an member of Parliament in Bonn, he won his party's nomination for premier in the state of Lower Saxony in 1984.  He lost that time, but won four years later. Last March, he gained a third term in a landslide, a victory that clinched his nomination for Chancellor. **********Except for the good suits and expensive cigars, Mr. Schroder lives unpretentiously in a smallish apartment in Hanover, the state capital. He has no vast entourage, disdaining all but the most basic security protection. **********Lower Saxony, covering most of the northwestern corner of the country, is perhaps best known outside Germany for the fact that Hanover's ruling family acceded to the British throne in the person of George I in 1714. The state includes Hamlen, where the Pied Piper played, and Wolfsburg, headquarters of Volkswagen. **********A seat on the Volkswagen board goes with the premier's job because the state government is the company's largest shareholder.  And that, by all accounts, has had a major impact on Mr. Schroder's life. In a number of ways, he modeled himself on the company's wily chairman, Ferdinand Piech. **********For centuries, Hanover has held annual trade fairs, and Mr. Schroder became a regular at them, courting businessmen, inviting them to dinner at a favorite Italian restaurant or to a game of tennis. **********But he always kept his fences mended with younger, more proletarian groups as well. Dr. Ludolf von Wertenberg, the head of the Federation of German Industries, who was a Christian Democratic member of Parliament when Mr. Schroder was in Bonn, recalled that Mr. Schroder always asked beforehand who would be in the audience when he was invited to make a speech. **********Keeping a Close Eye On the Audience **********''Students? He'd show up in a turtleneck,'' Dr. von Wertenberg said in an interview in his Cologne office. ''Entrepreneurs? The whitest shirt you ever saw. He's amazingly good on his feet, never uses texts or notes if he can avoid it, and if he sensed that what he was saying wasn't going over well, he'd change gears within seconds. Nice guy, provacateur, it didn't matter, as long as he wasn't ignored.'' **********He bulled his way to the nomination for Chancellor, taking his case over the heads of the party leaders to the rank-and-file. **********''Schroder's will for power is certainly impressive,'' the former party chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, wrote in his memoirs. ''But the question increasingly is, What does he want to do with that power?'' **********But the leaders gave him his shot at the Chancellorship anyway, and he opened his campaign two weeks ago with three rallies in a single day, in Berlin, Munich and Bonn. Relaxed, at times almost professorial in his interviews and news conferences, he let it rip on the stump. His voice hoarse from shouting, his face almost as red as his power necktie, Mr. Schroder greeted the crowds with both arms aloft in a V-for-Victory sign like Richard M. Nixon's. **********At Rheinaue Park in Bonn, along the riverfront, there were bratwurst stands and beer vendors, hot-air balloons and rock musicians. Some in the audience wore football jerseys marked ''Schroder 10'' -- a reference to the candidate's habit of giving people a flyer listing nine reasons to vote for the Social Democrats and telling them, ''The 10th is Helmut Kohl.'' **********There was also a lot of talk, from Mr. Schroder and other party figures about building an economy that was both humane and efficient, some complaints about the lot of the lowest-paid people in German society and the inevitable vague allusion to a new alliance linking labor, management and government. **********But there was not a single mention of socialism. **********Occasionally, Mr. Schroder got into some tried-and-true Social Democratic grooves, lambasting the Government, for example, for allowing disabled workers to collect only 80 per cent of their wages when sick. This, he said, ''is not social justice; they can't go to the store and pay 80 per cent of the price of a loaf of bread or get their landlord to give them a 20 percent discount.'' **********That went over well enough with the crowd of 8,000 to 10,000, although they had been soaked by rains. But what they had on their minds most of all, it seemed, was what Mr. Schroder is concentrating on: winning. **********Their loudest cheers came when he told them: ''We want to win -- we will win -- because we want to do -- we will do -- something for the German people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/18/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/02/world/world-economies-in-latin-america-mistakes-hobble-venezuelan-economy-experts-say.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Schemo", "pub_date": "1998-09-02", "snippet": "International market analysts say Venezuela's economy has been crippled by overvalued currency, government interference in monetary policy and irresponsible spending that relies too heavily on oil revenues; Col Hugo Chavez Frias, leading president...", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mistakes Hobble Venezuelan Economy, Experts Say", "print_headline": "WORLD ECONOMIES: IN LATIN AMERICA; Mistakes Hobble Venezuelan Economy, Experts Say", "body_text": " **********With investment holdings flying out of this country, international market analysts widely agree that Venezuela's economy has been crippled by an overvalued currency, government interference in monetary policy and irresponsible spending that relies too heavily on oil revenues. **********Many Venezuelans, however, beg to disagree. **********Their political mood seems to be swinging in precisely the opposite direction, with an overwhelming majority apparently convinced that the  oil wealth should guarantee decent salaries, government services, job protection and retirement benefits. Instead, with 80 percent of the population said to be living in poverty, the country faces broad suspicions of market changes, widely described here as ''capitalsmo salvaje,'' or ''savage capitalism.'' **********The leading candidate for the presidency by a wide margin is Hugo Chavez Frias, 44, a populist retired army colonel who led a coup attempt against President Carlos Andres Perez in 1992. Mr. Andres Perez was the architect of a short-lived stab at free-market changes in the early 1990's. **********Colonel Chavez is leading the polls with 46 percent, with his nearest rival, Henrique Salas Romer, trailing at 27 percent, according to a polling service, Datanalisis. **********Colonel Chavez, trading in his uniform and red beret for business suits as he campaigns, has raised the specter of protectionist barriers to foreign trade, hinted at the possibilities of a one- or two-year moratorium on debt payments and pledged to review concessions that the state has granted foreign oil companies. **********Those measures have been widely seen as hostile to foreign investors. **********Colonel Chavez's populist message, faulting government corruption for siphoning 15 percent of public revenues, resonates with Venezuelans who are hard pressed to reconcile the petroleum wealth with the fiscal difficulties. Colonel Chavez has called for a halt to privatization of state assets, at least, he says, until the country has some assurance that the revenues from the sales of assets are going to the national budget rather than the personal accounts of that corrupt officials have in Miami. **********''He's a nationalist,'' said Omar Lambaia, 53, a retired military photographer who drives a taxicab. Mr. Lambaia retired 11 years ago and collects a pension equal to the full salary of an officer on active duty, but he said the Government was shortchanging him. **********''Of course,'' Mr. Lambaia said, ''I'm democratic. But when you see that democracy is not doing anything for your country, that it's destroying the country, you become a nationalist.'' **********A survey by a poll analyst, Alfredo Keller, found that more than 85 percent of Venezuelans felt cheated out of the benefits of the oil wealth. **********''It's a mining-boom-town mentality that weakens the notion that one's well-being is tied to personal effort,'' said Robert Bottome, publisher of a newsletter, Veneconomy. **********Because of its failure to reduce the Civil Service system and revise its pension system, the Government has essentially used the revenues it gained during earlier years of high oil prices to pay the salaries of workers who are not really needed. More than 30 percent of the government budget goes to pay off debt, said Hugo Faria, a consultant at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Business. **********The price of oil, responsible for nearly half the country's revenues, has dropped a third in recent months, taking the bottom out of the economy. The stock market has dropped more than 70 percent this year. **********Analysts say the Venezuelan bolivar is overvalued by up to 40 percent. Although the Government has repeatedly denied plans to devalue the bolivar, expectations of a devaluation persist. That is forcing the Government to spend down international reserves to $13 billion to protect the bolivar and to pump up interest rates for short-term bonds to borrow additional money. **********At least $4.1 billion in short-term bond is due in coming months, further draining dollar reserves. **********''The market is jumping ahead so fast that nobody is willing to hold bolivars, because they don't know when the devaluation will come,'' said Mr. Bottome. **********Lending rates to consumers are hovering at 100 percent a year, and even at those rates the terms are punishing. Banks demand that company presidents put up their houses and cars as collateral for business loans. **********Yesterday, Standard & Poor revised its rating of Venezuela's financial prospects downward, to negative from stable. The service cited resistance from the presidency to the man in the street to ''essential market-oriented reforms needed to stabilize the economy.'' **********The agency said that fixed costs like debt service, Social Security and personnel took up 75 percent of Government spending and that the main source of government financing, oil revenues, was subject to shifts on the world market. The agency predicted that the Venezuelan budget deficit would reach 4 percent of the gross domestic product."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/07/business/company-news-safeguard-scientifics-leads-group-buying-pac-west.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-07-07", "snippet": "Group led by Safeguard Scientifics will buy Pac-West Telecomm Inc for $115 million; group includes Pac-West chairman, Bruce Westphal, and founder and president, John La Rue (S)", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS LEADS GROUP BUYING PAC-WEST", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS LEADS GROUP BUYING PAC-WEST", "body_text": " **********A group led by the information-technology company Safeguard Scientifics Inc. agreed yesterday to acquire Pac-West Telecomm Inc., a  privately held competitive local exchange carrier on the West Coast, for $115 million.

O. Abiola, the Nigerian opposition leader who died in detention on Tuesday, said they had found no evidence of poisoning and concluded that his death was caused by heart disease. **********The preliminary report, anxiously awaited by an angry and disoriented nation, showed that ''there was severe longstanding disease of the heart of a type and severity that can cause unexpected death,'' said Dr. James G. Young, the Chief Coroner of the Province of Ontario. **********The results, confirming the official account of Mr. Abiola's death given by the Nigerian military Government, seemed unlikely to assuage Nigerians, who have reacted with fury to the death of the opposition leader on the eve of his promised release by the new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. **********Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been ruled by military governments for all but 10 years of its 38 years of independence. Mr. Abiola, who appeared poised to win presidential elections in 1993 when the armed forces annulled the vote, incarnated the country's long-frustrated hopes for democracy. He was imprisoned by the military Government on charges of treason in 1994. **********Dr. Young, who headed a five-man team including two American doctors and an American technician, said that after a detailed examination of the body including the abdomen, chest and brain, and after conversations with witnesses present at the time of death, ''we believe that poisoning is extremely unlikely.'' **********But he added that for the sake of complete certainty, toxicological examinations of samples taken from the body would be performed at the Center of Forensic Science in Ontario. He said that tissue samples would also undergo microscopic examination in London and that a final report would be issued in three weeks. **********Family members and followers of Mr. Abiola have argued that he was poisoned, pointing to the cup of tea he drank with the United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, and other American and Nigerian officials shortly before he was taken ill. **********But Dr. Young said nothing that happened on the day of Mr. Abiola's death, or that was in his body, ''lead us to believe that poisoning was a factor.'' He added, ''At this time, our preliminary opinion is that death was due to natural causes as a result of his longstanding heart disease.'' **********Mr. Abiola, 60, had never had a heart attack before. Dr. Young said his team had not been given any written medical reports compiled during the opposition leader's four years in detention, but had talked to Nigerian medical officials who said they had seen him in those years. **********''For me, it's irrelevant,'' Kola Abiola, the opposition leader's son, said of the autopsy. ''You don't have to poison a man, you don't have to spike his tea, to kill him. My father was locked up for four years without proper medical treatment, and that is what leads to death. We know who was responsible for locking him up.'' **********Kola Abiola today presided at the tumultuous burial of Mr. Abiola in the front yard of the large Abiola family compound in Lagos. Women sobbed and men wailed as the body, wrapped in white cloth as prescribed by Muslim custom, was laid to rest in the red earth, beneath a palm tree, just eight hours after the autopsy. **********For a national figure of such standing, the attendance was not huge, amounting to perhaps 500 people. Representatives of the Government were conspicuously absent. Although General Abubakar said this week that the death of Mr. Abiola represented ''one of the saddest moments of our life,'' he was a prominent member of the Government of Gen. Sani Abacha that jailed him. **********Given the impassioned mood of the mourners, any attempt by military figures to appear would almost certainly have led to bloodshed. **********The army and military police officers initially deployed about 50 yards from Mr. Abiola's house, but later fell back before protesters, taking up positions about 500 yards away from it. Although they blocked some people, they did not use their automatic rifles. Clearly, General Abubakar had called for restraint. **********Mr. Abiola, a man of the southwestern Yoruba tribe who had converted to Islam, the faith of the Hausa and closely related Fulani tribes of the north, tried to overcome the ethnic divisions of his country. **********His death, just as it seemed he would be freed, has left many Nigerians with a sense of deep frustration at a moment when General Abubakar is talking about the need to put the army back in the barracks and restore democracy. Sporadic rioting, in which as many as 50 people have died, has gripped the country since Tuesday, but Lagos was calm today. **********Dr. Young, who arrived here on Thursday, said the autopsy showed that Mr. Abiola had longstanding heart disease of two types, both of which could cause unexpected death. ''There was severe narrowing of the main coronary arteries by fatty plaques,'' he said. ''In addition there was very significant enlargement of the heart due to longstanding hypertension.'' **********The doctor declined to be drawn into discussing whether four years of imprisonment might have contributed to this hypertension by causing extreme stress. ''Is it desirable to have the best of diets and the most stress-free life?'' he said. ''Yes, of course it is.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/24/business/company-reports-boeing-earnings-news-disappoints-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1998-07-24", "snippet": "Boeing Co stuns investors with news of steep drop in second-quarter earnings and even more unexpected warning that results for both this year and next will be about 40 percent below Wall Street estimates; earnings fell 46 percent, to $258 million ...", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boeing Earnings News Disappoints Investors", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS; Boeing Earnings News Disappoints Investors", "body_text": " **********The Boeing Company stunned investors yesterday with news of a steep drop in second-quarter earnings and an even more unexpected warning that results for both this year and next will be about 40 percent below Wall Street estimates. **********The announcement from the world's largest aerospace company caused a 13 percent drop in Boeing's share price and was one of the catalysts for a nearly 200-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing shares, one of the Dow average's component stocks, had been rallying in recent weeks. **********''They know how to build bombs,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, ''and they delivered one today.'' **********Boeing's results and the guidance it offered for next year helped convince investors that the company is not likely to cash in on the current boom in commercial aircraft sales because of its high costs and stiff price competition from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's main rival. **********For the quarter that ended June 30, earnings fell 46 percent, to $258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, compared with  $476 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period last year. The average forecast for the quarter by analysts was 33 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks corporate earnings estimates. **********Boeing's revenue rose 9 percent, to $13.4 billion, from $12.3 billion in 1997. The company said it took a $78 million after-tax charge during the quarter to account for costs related to its previously announced decision to stop making the MD-11 jetliner and for penalties paid to airlines because of late deliveries of the new version of its single-aisle 737 jet. **********Investors reacted by dumping Boeing shares, which fell $6.5625, to $41.1875, in New York Stock Exchange trading on volume that exceeded 28 million shares. During the day the share price touched $40.0625, a 52-week low. **********Boeing has been struggling to right itself since last fall, when a surge in commercial airplane orders overwhelmed its assembly lines. The production difficulties have forced the company to take more than $3 billion in charges and delayed long-planned productivity improvements aimed at cutting costs. **********In addition, the costs of merging with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which it purchased for $16.3 billion last year, have proved to be more than expected and the economic crisis in Asia has dampened the demand for new airplanes from some of Boeing's best customers. **********As a result of these trials, Boeing's commercial airplane division, which represents about 60 percent of overall revenue, lost money in the first half of this year. The company predicted that the division's profit margins would be between zero and 1 percent this year, rising to between 2 and 4 percent in 1999 -- far lower than many analysts had expected. **********Philip M. Condit, chairman and chief executive of the Seattle-based company, acknowledged that the company's performance had been weak. But he said that he was determined to transform Boeing from a company that focuses primarily on the performance of its products to one that is ''financially driven.'' **********He outlined a series of ambitious goals, including raising Boeing's annual return on sales to 7 percent from its current level of 2 percent. The company also aims to save money by turning over its inventory four times a year rather than just two. **********Given Boeing's recent performance, even the company's short-term goals would appear beyond its grasp. Boeing plans to produce 620 planes next year, up from 546 in 1998. At the same time, it expects to reduce overall employment by the end of next year to between 210,000 and 220,000 from 238,000 today. **********Mr. Condit acknowledged that consistently earning a 7 percent return on sales would not be easy, though he said it could be achieved by 2000. ''This is clearly a difficult goal,'' he told analysts. ''This is not one we have reached before. We have only come close at the peak.'' **********Indeed, there are already warning signs that assurances from Mr. Condit earlier this month that Boeing's production difficulties were finally under control may have been premature. Yesterday Boeing said that expensive out-of-sequence work on its 747 production line had risen nearly 20 percent since July 1 and was above the company's plan. **********''It's worrying, but it is not disastrous,'' said Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president. **********The situation in Asia also seems to be worsening. Boeing said it currently has 20 completed airplanes in storage waiting for final payment arrangements by Asian customers. Singapore Air said yesterday that it was deferring delivery of one 747, eight 777's and two Airbus A340's beyond 2000. Korean Air has also said that it will probably defer some 747's and 777's scheduled for delivery next year. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Condit said that after seeing its cash reserves drop to $3.5 billion this quarter from $5.1 billion at the end of 1997, Boeing expects to begin generating a lot of cash next year. **********Boyd Givan, the company's chief financial officer, said the money might be used for a share repurchase plan. Whether that will be enough to appease investors is unclear. **********''I don't think they are particularly proud of what they handed everybody today,'' Mr. Rubel said. ''At the same token, the hype is gone. The pieces on the board have moved back to Go. They now have to roll up their sleeves and work harder than they ever have before.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/24/technology/news-watch-portable-music-player-uses-no-tape-or-disk-just-ram.html": {"writer_name": "Michel Marriott", "pub_date": "1998-09-24", "snippet": "Diamond Multimedia Systems creates Rio PMP 300, portable music player about size of pager that can store up to 60 minutes of digital-quality music directly into its 32 megabytes of memory; Rio comes with software that also permits users to convert...", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Portable Music Player Uses No Tape or Disk -- Just RAM", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Portable Music Player Uses No Tape or Disk -- Just RAM", "body_text": " **********A popular way to buy, trade and download music on the Internet may now become even more popular.

We're talking about James Rogers -- but not the longtime General Electric executive who recently became an investment banker in New York. This is James E. Rogers -- but no, not the James E. Rogers who is chief executive of the Cinergy Corporation, the utility holding company in Cincinnati. **********Those sound-alikes may be pretty open-handed, but it is James E. Rogers of Las Vegas, Nev., who has just made philanthropic history. This Mr. Rogers, a lawyer by training, is the owner and chairman of the Sunbelt Communications Company, which owns KVBC, the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, and eight other television stations in five Rocky Mountain states. **********Last week, Mr. Rogers doubled, to $100 million, an earlier record-breaking pledge to the University of Arizona's college of law in Tucson; promised $15 million more to match other donors' gifts to the school, and pledged $15 million to other programs at the university. Even at the initial $50 million, his gift was the largest ever made to an American law school, according to Joel Seligman, the dean of the school, which this month was named the James E. Rogers College of Law. **********Mr. Rogers has also made a $28.5 million pledge, announced on Nov. 4, to the new law school at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, and he has made numerous gifts to other colleges and schools in the towns where Sunbelt owns stations. **********What gives? **********''I think we should abandon the concept of 'giving,' '' said Mr. Rogers, a cherubic-looking man who wore jeans and a red tattersall shirt to a recent lunch at a modest bistro in Manhattan. That concept, he said, implies that one's success is one's own. **********In reality, he argued, ''your success is the convergence of a lot of lucky events -- you were born in America, with a good brain, with parents who taught you good values -- none of which you had any control over.'' **********In his view, if those lucky breaks helped you build a fortune, you should give most of it away. That's what he's planning to do. **********''I think you have a right to spend whatever you believe is necessary to maintain your chosen standard of living,'' Mr. Rogers said. Born into a middle-class family, he maintains a very pleasant standard of living himself -- with three homes, a horse-breeding ranch in Idaho and a collection of 85 vintage automobiles. **********But after you get all the toys, ''what you have left, you hold in trust for the public,'' he said quietly. ''I'm holding my money in trust for education.'' Then, he added with a grin, ''if you think of it that way, it makes it a lot easier to give it away.'' **********Mr. Rogers, who is 60, is worth somewhere around $500 million. And he has made it clear that he intends to give away about 75 percent of that money to promote education -- because ''it is part and parcel of who we are.'' **********Leaving the bulk of his fortune to his three successful adult children is out of the question. **********''Leaving children wealth is like leaving them a case of psychological cancer,'' Mr. Rogers said firmly, explaining that he believes a child can never gain a sense of his true worth under such circumstances. Beverly, his third wife, and his three children all support his plans, he said. **********Born in Louisville, Ky., Mr. Rogers moved with his family to Las Vegas in 1951. In 1960 he earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Arizona, and two years later he graduated from the law school there. He added a master's in law from the University of Southern California and almost finished a doctorate in law at the University of Illinois before opening his law practice in Las Vegas in 1964. **********In 1971, he and some business partners filed an application to take over an existing television license in Las Vegas. In late 1978, after years of litigation involving the former owner, the application was approved and Mr. Rogers, at 40, became a broadcasting executive -- just as his region's growth broke into a gallop. ''We caught lightning in a bottle,'' he said. **********HIS pledge to the Arizona law school -- half of which is to be paid over 20 years and the remainder upon his death -- will transform his alma mater, said Dean Seligman, whose current annual budget is just $7 million. Tuition increases, frequent in recent years, will be a thing of the past. More scholarship money will become available, and top faculty can be attracted. **********Yes, Mr. Rogers has heard most of the nasty lawyer jokes. ''Some of them are pretty funny,'' he said. But he still thinks the law is a noble calling. ''And I bet more lawyers would use their skills to help the downtrodden if they did not come out of law school $125,000 in debt,'' he added. **********Mr. Rogers denies any religious impulse in his giving, but John Sexton, the dean of the New York University Law School and an informal adviser to Mr. Rogers, said he thought ''a deep moral compulsion is at work -- and a belief in the impact the law can have on society.'' **********Mr. Rogers was clearly influenced by his friend and late business partner, Louis Wiener Jr., a legendary Las Vegas lawyer whose clients included most of the boom town's casino hotels and the gangster Bugsy  Siegel. **********Mr. Wiener, a tireless fund-raiser for charity, prodded friends to be more generous by asking those who had attended funerals ''whether they had seen a Brinks truck riding behind the hearse,'' said Mr. Rogers, who was his friend's executor. When Mr. Wiener died in February 1996, Mr. Rogers followed his wishes to the letter: Behind the hearse was a Wells Fargo armored truck -- all the Brinks trucks in town were busy -- bearing a sign that read, ''I've changed my mind; I'm taking it with me.'' **********Mr. Rogers got the hint: He is not taking it with him. ''I'd rather distribute my assets myself than have the Federal Government distribute them after I die,'' he said. ''I think I can do a better job. And I sure as hell can have a lot more fun.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/business/markets-market-place-woolworth-stock-has-been-strong-but-will-nike-sales-company.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1998-03-24", "snippet": "Market Place column on outlook for Woolworth Corp focuses on future revenues from its Foot Locker division; graph (L)", "word_count": 995, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; Woolworth stock has been strong, but will Nike sales at the company's Foot Locker unit hurt?", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; Woolworth stock has been strong, but will Nike sales at the company's Foot Locker unit hurt?", "body_text": " **********DOTH the Woolworth Corporation protest a bit too much? **********The company, which closed the last of its namesake five-and-dime stores last summer, now gets most of its revenues from its Foot Locker division, and Nike, the leading maker of athletic shoes and clothing, accounts for a big portion of sales in those stores. Nike has reported several bad quarters and has dragged down much of the athletic market with it. **********Yet Woolworth's executives keep telling Wall Street they are undaunted and that the future looks bright. Investors are on board, having pushed up the stock 31 percent this year to close at $26.625, unchanged, yesterday. **********Still, Woolworth's sales fell 5.6 percent last year. Sales in its stores open at least one year, the best measure of a retailer's health, fell 4.3 percent -- 5.9 percent in the critical fourth quarter alone. Meanwhile, sales at Finish Line, Just For Feet and some other competitors rose. **********When it comes to investor relations, Woolworth scores points for damage control. Last week, when Nike announced that its fiscal third-quarter earnings fell 69 percent because of slumping sales at home and in Asia and that it would lay off 7  percent of its global work force, Woolworth put out its own cheery announcements: a licensing deal to make and sell shoes under the brand name Champion, owned by Sara Lee, and the sale of a handful of nurseries in the Silicon Valley. **********Woolworth no longer reports monthly same-store sales, but has managed to placate Wall Street stock analysts with news about how it plans to increase its square footage by 20 percent a year for the next few years and how it has budgeted $1 billion to remodel tired stores and open new, bigger ones. **********Further, it has been peddling a story to business reporters about its impending name change for several weeks, apparently in hopes of drawing attention away from the real question: just how much of Nike's pain will Woolworth share? **********Woolworth does not disclose what portion of its sales come from Nike merchandise, but analysts and money managers estimate that Woolworth controls about 16 percent of the United States athletic footwear market, and about 40 percent of the market for athletic shoes over $40 (i.e. Nike). **********The next biggest footwear merchant, J. C. Penney, claims just 6 percent of the athletic shoe market. Finish Line and Just For Feet each hold about 3 percent. **********At Foot Locker stores, footwear makes up roughly 75 percent of the merchandise, with Nike representing 30 to 50 percent of that category, investors estimate. This hardly represents immunity to Nike, which conceded last week that earnings would not improve until the 1999 fiscal year. Calls to the office of the chairman and chief executive, Roger N. Farah, were not returned. **********Changes are afoot, though, at Woolworth's athletic division, including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kid's Foot Locker and Champs stores. In remodeled stores, Nike is not front and center, but other hot fashion brands like Vans and Timberland. Woolworth is also working to freshen its apparel merchandise, a weak portion of the athletic store business. **********Many athletic retailers have given lip service to better clothing. But Woolworth is one of the few run by a highly regarded merchant, Mr. Farah, formerly of R. H. Macy & Company and other stores. Investors say that remodeled stores are outperforming expectations. **********What is more, the company has done a good job with its balance sheet. When Mr. Farah took the helm in 1994, the company was teetering under a load of debt. It now has virtually none. Selling, general and administrative costs fell to 23.2 percent of sales last year from 24.4 percent of sales in 1996, even as the company expanded stores. **********Taking advantage of cash flow, Woolworth has made acquisitions to strengthen its lead. The company, which is expected to announce a new sporty name the first week of April, has acquired Eastbay Inc., an athletic goods catalogue business, and Athletic Fitters, a regional chain with stores in the West and Midwest. And the company's mall stores that do not sell athletic goods have been pared down to the best and brightest. **********What is more, investors give Mr. Farah and his company high marks for the plan to increase sales space by 20 percent a year for three years, arguing that even if same-store sales are flat, there will be revenue growth. **********''I think he has done a very good job with the company,'' said William Sams, a portfolio manager for First Pacific Advisors in Dallas. ''Before he got there, they were in real serious trouble with short-term debt, and when he got in there, it was worse than he thought. It didn't take him long to get the debt down.'' **********And on a positive note for all retailers, Nike has begun offering special deals and better allocations of once scarce merchandise. Woolworth should benefit the most, given its vast business in the past with the sneaker company. But if Woolworth's primary strategy is to fill its stores with brands like Vans and Timberland, those Nike deals may prove illusory. **********And while adding stores and brightening old ones are often easy ways to please Wall Street, Woolworth is hardly alone in its growth plans. Susan Silverstein, a retail analyst at Nations Bank Montgomery Securities, expects the top six athletic footwear retailers to increase their square footage by 20 percent in 1998, on top of a 21 percent increase last year. **********If investors believe in Mr. Farah, and those who remember his Federated days have good reason to, Woolworth's stock still looks cheap at about 14 times trailing earnings. **********But while America returns to shoes as diverse as Candies and Timberland in what have been traditionally considered athletic apparel stores, Woolworth will probably continue to smart from Nike's woes. **********''They are trying to diversify by adding private-label exclusives and other nontraditional athletic brands,'' Ms. Silverstein said. ''But nonetheless Nike is still half the athletic footwear business.'' And athletic footwear, no matter what the company's name, is what the market believes Woolworth is about."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/31/world/saudis-end-inquiry-in-blast-that-killed-19-us-airmen.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1998-03-31", "snippet": "Saudi Arabia completes investigation into 1996 terrorist bombing of US military base in Dhahran, that left 19 airmen dead, but declines to immediately release results; announcement catches Clinton Administration by surprise and leads to new fears ...", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saudis End Inquiry in Blast That Killed 19 U.S. Airmen", "print_headline": "Saudis End Inquiry in Blast That Killed 19 U.S. Airmen", "body_text": " **********The Saudi Arabian Government said today that it had completed its investigation into the June 1996 terrorist bombing there that left 19 American airmen dead but would not immediately release the results of the inquiry. The announcement caught the Clinton Administration by surprise and led to new fears that the culprits might never be brought to justice. **********Officials at the State Department and the Justice Department said the American investigation of the bombing of the Khobar Towers apartment complex in eastern Saudi Arabia was far from over and that the terrorists had not been identified with certainty. **********The American officials, who have long been critical of the Saudi Government for not cooperating in the investigation, said the Saudis had yet to share their detailed findings with the United States, although a Saudi official indicated the information would be made available. **********There was concern, officials said, that the Saudis did not conduct an adequate inquiry because it might produce evidence of a link between the bombers and Iran, embarrassing the Saudi Government. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have warmed dramatically recently. **********''As far as we're concerned, the investigation is still wide open,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ''We do not believe it's over. We are continuing to pursue it and believe that at the end of the day, those responsible will need to pay a price.'' **********Mr. Rubin, who unlike other United States officials did not directly criticize the Saudis today, said he did not know ''what has or hasn't been shared between Saudi law enforcement investigators and American law enforcement investigators'' in recent days. But an American official with knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said the Justice Department learned of the completion of the Saudi investigation through news agency reports today from Saudi Arabia. **********The relationship between the Justice Department, which is overseeing the investigation for the United States, and the Saudis remains ''chilly,'' the official noted. **********The 19 American airmen were killed on June 25, 1996, when terrorists drove a large truck filled with explosives to the perimeter of an apartment complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and fired a detonator. The blast left an 80-foot crater. **********Suspicion was widespread in Saudi Arabia and the United States that the bombing might have been directed by Iran, which has long protested the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia and has been accused of involvement in other terrorist acts against the United States. **********The airmen had been deployed to Saudi Arabia to take part in American air patrols that have been conducted over southern Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. **********Iran has denied involvement in the Khobar Towers bombing and has recently moved to improve its relationship with the Saudis. American officials have said that the warming in Saudi-Iranian relations has complicated the investigation. **********The Saudi announcement today was made by the Interior Minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdul Aziz, who said in a news conference in Mecca, the Saudi holy city, that ''all the facts concerning the crime are in our hands,'' and that Saudi investigators had ''exerted great efforts to learn all the facts and each detail about this incident.'' He said the findings ''will be released in due course.'' **********In the past the Saudis have confirmed that they had detained suspects in the case. But the number of suspects and their nationality have not been clear, and it was not certain today whether the suspects were still jailed and faced punishment. **********A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington said he could not comment on details of the investigation except to confirm the Interior Minister's comments. **********The United States announced last fall that it would drop criminal charges against a Saudi dissident who was once described as a central figure in the bombing and who is still in custody here, awaiting deportation hearings. **********The dissident, Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, who once lived in Iran, fled to Canada after the bombing and was arrested there. Saudi intelligence officials identified Mr. al-Sayegh as the driver of a car that signaled the driver of the explosives-laden truck to the site of the blast. **********Mr. al-Sayegh was deported to the United States from Canada as part of a plea agreement in which he initially agreed to provide the Justice Department with information about the bombing in exchange for a promise that he would not be returned to Saudi Arabia, where he almost certainly face execution by beheading. **********But on arrival in the United States, he reneged on the agreement with the Justice Department, claiming he was not involved in the bombing and had no information for American prosecutors. He has recently insisted that he was not in Saudi Arabia when the bombing occurred."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/business/continental-airlines-posts-record-net-before-charge.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1998-10-20", "snippet": "Continental Airlines reports record third-quarter earnings, excluding previously announced one-time charge, and acknowledges publicly for first time that Clinton Administration might file suit to block Northwest Airlines from buying controlling st...", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental Airlines Posts Record Net Before Charge", "print_headline": "Continental Airlines Posts Record Net Before Charge", "body_text": " **********Continental Airlines reported record third-quarter earnings yesterday, excluding a previously announced one-time charge, and acknowledged publicly for the first time that the Clinton Administration might file suit to block Northwest Airlines from buying a controlling stake in Continental. **********Continental said its net earnings declined 34 percent, to $73 million, because of a $77 million after-tax charge to retire older jets.

Smisek, Continental's general counsel, said in a statement yesterday. **********If the Government does sue, Northwest and Continental are expected to challenge the Government in court because they think they have a strong case. **********Mr. Bethune said yesterday that Continental would probably remain profitable for the foreseeable future without the Northwest alliance but that its profits would be much greater if the deal went forward. **********''It is not necessary to us,'' he said, ''but it would be tremendously beneficial to us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/business/paid-notice-deaths-gittleman-fannie-c.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GITTLEMAN, FANNIE C.", "print_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GITTLEMAN, FANNIE C.", "body_text": " **********GITTLEMAN-Fannie C.

The Associated Press reported that The News, an English-language newspaper in Islamabad, quoted Dr. Qadeer Khan as saying that Pakistan's bomb program was more advanced than India's because it used uranium rather than plutonium. ''They have used the old technology of plutonium from spent fuel, whereas we have used enriched uranium, which is much more sophisticated and a safer process,'' Dr. Qadeer Khan was quoted as saying. **********But experts say just the opposite is true if the aim is to put the nuclear weapon atop a missile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/world/johannesburg-journal-for-rising-crime-rate-high-rise-jail-to-match.html": {"writer_name": "Donald McNeil", "pub_date": "1998-02-28", "snippet": "54-story Ponte Building in Johannesburg, once-fashionable address that is now dilapidated, may become world's tallest prison, as South Africa copes with exploding crime rates and inmate population that has reached 140,000; escapes are major proble...", "word_count": 1278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Johannesburg Journal; For Rising Crime Rate, High-Rise Jail to Match", "print_headline": "Johannesburg Journal; For Rising Crime Rate, High-Rise Jail to Match", "body_text": " **********Admittedly, the Ponte Building here is no Empire State Building. To be kind, it looks like a cement knockoff of the Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles. To be cruel, it resembles a giant hair curler. **********It was once a fashionable address, but laundry now hangs in its windows, its swimming pool is a fetid swamp and bags of trash regularly plummet down its central well, which recalls the dark space station core where Luke Skywalker fought Darth Vader. **********But for sheer prominence, the Ponte dominates the skyline of Johannesburg the way the Empire State Building does midtown Manhattan's. It is 54 stories tall, perched on a hill and topped by a five-story Coca-Cola sign that may be the world's largest neon ad. **********By late next year, if the owners and the Government get their way, the Ponte will be the world's tallest prison. South Africa badly needs more jails. Because of rapidly rising crime and slowly rising police competence, the national inmate population has grown from 110,000 in 1994 to 140,000 now, and the number of defendants awaiting trial has doubled. **********Escapes are a serious problem. Every day, nearly 500 inmates must be bused to the downtown Johannesburg courts from Boksburg, 15 miles away. Some pay off the drivers and disappear. Police holding cells are also notoriously porous. The dilapidated station closest to the Ponte has 12 cells and on a tough day processes more than 200 arrests. **********Last year, one escape provoked a particularly loud outcry -- not because Isaac Mofokeng was a criminal mastermind, but because he was the man who had shot Max the Gorilla. Pursued from a house burglary, Mr. Mofokeng had scaled the walls of the Johannesburg Zoo and then of Max's compound. **********Big Max, defending his mate, bit Mr. Mofokeng and two policemen who jumped in after him, and Mr. Mofokeng shot him twice. Max survived to become Newsmaker of the Year, a national symbol of citizens fighting back against crime. **********If it took a 600-pound gorilla to draw the nation's attention to the escape problem, it took a 550-foot skyscraper to draw it to novel solutions. **********The $50 million plan, drawn up by Paul Silver, a New York architect who helped design the renovation of the Tombs in Manhattan and the tuberculosis wards on Rikers Island, calls for the building to be split into 11 ''mini-jails.'' **********The Ponte's central shaft will be blocked every five floors with double decks, creating recreation, visiting and guardroom areas. Cells with steel mesh windows will ring the outside. The ground floors will contain a new police station, six courtrooms, a prison hospital with a public clinic and even a cafe. **********Ideally, it will be one-stop lockup: an arrested suspect will never leave the building until freed or sent to a long-term penitentiary. **********Mr. Silver's local partner, Osmond Lange Mosienyane, says it will cost 40 percent less than a new jail and will be privately run, with the state paying a daily fee for each prisoner. **********The Minister of Corrections, Sipho Mzimela, is so enthusiastic that he announced the Ponte Prison as a fait accompli to reporters at Parliament this month. A day later, his spokesman had to backtrack, noting that it was still only a proposal. Mr. Mzimela can be forgiven -- he is looking so hard for new cells that he has suggested using spent gold mines as oubliettes for hardened offenders. **********Even as a proposal, the Ponte plan has generated controversy. Although jails are common in American residential areas, and even sought after in some, the idea is new to South Africa. Radio talk shows have had many calls from panicky city residents. **********Mr. Silver calls in to argue his case: that the Ponte will be escape-proof and that the new lighting, police and jobs will revive the area. **********''We estimate it will bring in 750 correctional employees who'll want to live nearby,'' he said. ''Plus new stores, and lawyers who'll want offices. I know brokers are already taking out options on properties nearby.'' **********If that is true, they are brave. The Ponte is feared as the most notorious building in a notorious neighborhood. ''A jail?'' one neighbor snickered. ''The only difference will be that there'll be a lock on the door.'' **********When opened in 1968, it was one of Johannesburg's fanciest addresses. The penthouse triplexes have saunas, wet bars, private tanning decks and views nearly to Pretoria. The 724 apartments quickly filled with doctors and lawyers. ''If you said you stayed in Ponte, you were No. 1,'' said A. J. Fourie, the maintenance chief. **********But the decay of downtown in the last 15 years radically changed it. The Berea and Hillbrow neighborhoods below became famous first for bars and cafes brave with multiracialism, and then for muggers and drug deals. The professionals moved out. ''We don't have 10 white people left in the building,'' said Nicholas Peta, the security chief. **********''Full of immigrants'' is the way xenophobic locals, black and white, dismiss the Ponte now. There are tales of refrigerators tossed on police cars and corpses dropping down the shaft after shootouts. **********The truth, as is so often the case, is milder. ''Most of the stories you read about this building are totally made up,'' said Steve Evans, the day manager. **********Nowadays, the Ponte actually feels like a giant dormitory. The technical colleges nearby are expanding, and the building is 60 percent filled with students. Another 20 percent is empty, and the remaining 20 percent occupied by ''mostly Ethiopians, who are nonviolent,'' Mr. Evans said. It takes a building ID card to get past the guard booth, and overnight visits are restricted. A nightclub on the outside plaza was closed down, and armed security teams roam the halls at night. **********''There used to be blood on the stairs every weekend,'' Mr. Peta said. ''Now we don't get more than one or two muggings a year inside.'' **********Security is reinforced in a more subtle way: one penthouse was turned over, rent-free, to a police colonel. A second became a police party pad, with barbecues on the house. **********''That made the drug dealers uncomfortable,'' Mr. Fourie said. **********Some true stories did help to demonize the Ponte. In 1992 a security guard was killed by a Coke bottle dropped from a window. And Patrick Nkomo, a security captain since 1977, remembers the day three years ago that an amateur parachutist called local television stations to announce that he would jump from the roof. Their crews arrived, he greeted them in a white suit, took an elevator upstairs, made sure they were ready and leapt. But without a chute. **********''He'd had a fight with the wife,'' Mr. Nkomo said, shaking his head. **********''He was spread out over 30 meters,'' Mr. Fourie added. ''They cleaned him away with a firehose. You know, they never found his left hand. A sergeant said: 'Ach, forget it, man. Some cat carried it off.' '' **********Now, while outsiders debate whether they fear the jail plan or the imaginary residents more, the real residents fear having to leave. **********Sabelo Hlatshwayo, 21, shares a four-bedroom penthouse with five other students for $72 a month each. In his three years of studying electrical engineering at the nearby Witwatersrand Technikon, he has never been mugged. ''Safe so far,'' he said. **********He opposes a prison, not because he fears it, but because he needs to stay. ''The schools haven't put up sufficient residences,'' he said. ''We don't know where we'll go.'' **********But Johannesburg has nothing to compare to New York's rent control laws, so the students can be evicted relatively easily. **********One other question does keep coming up: what about the Coke sign? **********Mr. Silver and his partners say they do not know yet. **********But they have already dismissed one proposal as tasteless: that it be amended to read, ''Corrections -- The Pause That Refreshes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/19/world/port-au-prince-journal-whose-rock-is-it-and-yes-the-haitians-care.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1998-10-19", "snippet": "US and Haiti are engaged in war of words over ownership of Navassa Island, uninhabited outcropping in Caribbean island barely two miles square, rich in insect species organic fertilizer; pledge by Interior Department to protect island from interlo...", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Port-au-Prince Journal; Whose Rock Is It?

The group returned with tales of finding ''biological riches unimagined,'' which led Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to warn of his intention to protect the island from interlopers -- perhaps with Coast Guard vessels. **********''If you were going to consider a system of protected areas, you'd definitely want to include Navassa in the portfolio,'' said Michael L. Smith, leader of the expedition, which was sponsored by the Center for Marine Conservation, a Washington-based environmental group. **********''Navassa has a very special and extremely healthy coral reef,'' he added, ''and it is absolutely remarkable how much animal life we found there, including new species that are endemic to the island.'' **********The United States has controlled Navassa, just 40 miles off Haiti's southwest peninsula, for more than 140 years. But of the 24 constitutions Haiti has had since gaining independence from France in 1804, all but one of them described La Navase, as the island is called here, as an inalienable part of Haitian territory. **********The basis of the American claim is the Guano Islands Act of 1856, which authorized American vessels to establish sovereignty on any abandoned or unclaimed island that had reserves of the rich fertilizer derived from bird droppings. A year later, an American sea captain, Peter Duncan, planted the American flag on Navassa, which was followed by several decades of phosphate mining and construction of a Coast Guard lighthouse that was abandoned only in the 1950's. **********Today, Navassa ''is unorganized American territory, meaning that Congress has never set up or passed any statutes prescribing any particular type of administration,'' Mr. Babbitt said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''In the absence of that, the Interior Department is traditionally the place where these matters are dealt with.'' **********Mr. Babbitt declined to comment on Haiti's claim to the island, referring the matter to the State Department, which has consistently claimed American sovereignty for the island. ''I'm just the head gamekeeper around here,'' he said. ''My job is to administer the place and protect the coral reefs, and that's what we're doing.'' **********But he did add that he regards Navassa's legal status as no different from that of several remote islands in the Pacific that the United States administers, including Howland and Midway Islands. **********But Foreign Minister Fritz Longchamp of Haiti rejects the notion that Navassa is American territory of any sort. He pointed to the 1697 Treaty of Rijswijk, in which Spain gave up sovereignty over Haiti and the adjoining islands to France, and dismissed American possession of the island, and some 4,000 square miles of seabed around it, as irrelevant under international law. **********''La Navase is Haitian and a part of Haiti,'' he said in a recent interview here. ''If I own something and I make a decision not to use it, that does not give you the right to come and claim it.'' **********Complicating the situation even further, William Warren, a California businessman who says he wants to mine Navassa for organic fertilizer, has also made an ownership claim. He has filed suit against Mr. Babbitt and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, citing a 1905 document in which the State Department said it ''possessed no territorial sovereignty'' over the island. **********For weeks now, the Navassa imbroglio has filled news broadcasts and talk shows here. At one point, the American Ambassador, Timothy Carney, even suggested that since Haiti has many internal problems that need attention, the country's energies might be better directed toward resolving those issues, rather than focusing on a tiny island that few Haitians other than fishermen have ever visited. **********Since Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere and has been without a functioning Government for the more than a year, that observation, indelicate though it may have been, seemed self-evident. Nevertheless, Haitians have taken umbrage at Mr. Carney's remarks and begun to spin extravagant fantasies about his motives in pressing the American claim to the island. **********Lafanmi Lavalas, the political party organized by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, immediately condemned the American position and organized a protest late last month. Haiti is also awash with rumors that the United States covets Navassa because the August expedition discovered gold or uranium there or even, according to one version making the rounds here, a gateway to Atlantis. **********Those conjectures are baseless, but ''there is a great dollar dividend if we are talking biotechnology'' derived from some of the spider and insect species unique to the island, said Ernst Wilson, a Haitian oceanographer who has organized La Navase Island Defense Group to assert the Haitian claim. **********''La Navase is a perfect laboratory, and biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies are going to want to get into this because there is money there, I know it,'' he said. **********Dr. Smith said that in the interests of lowering the political temperature, he would be willing to include Haitian scientists like Dr. Wilson on future visits to the island. His goal, he stressed, is to assure that Navassa remains a pristine refuge for animal and plant species whose existence is endangered elsewhere in the Caribbean. **********''Science should be an activity that bridges diplomatic problems between countries,'' he said. ''As an American organization, we are subject to the Supreme Court ruling which says Navassa was properly annexed. But whoever ends up with jurisdiction over the island, we would like to see them manage it well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/21/business/dividend-meetings-950394.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********A partial list for this week. **********MONDAY **********NONE REPORTED **********TUESDAY **********Aquarion **********Keyspan Enrgy **********National Svc Inds **********New Cent Enrgies **********Nipsco Inds **********Nrth Fork Banc **********WEDNESDAY **********Allergan **********Comrcl Intertech **********Inland Stl **********Puerto Rican Cem **********THURSDAY **********Amer Home Prods **********Bec Enrgy **********Campbell Soup **********Conagra **********Conectiv **********Delmarv Pwr & Lt **********KCS Enrgy **********Millipore **********Trnsatlan Hldgs **********FRIDAY **********Alexandria Rl Est **********Ctrl Hud Gas & El **********Lilly"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/04/technology/l-computers-hard-to-use-261394.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-06-04", "snippet": "Dr Jakob Nielsen letter on May 28 article holds computers do not have to be hard to use", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Computers: Hard to Use?", "print_headline": "Computers: Hard to Use?", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Your article on May 28 asked, ''Do Computers Have to be Hard to Use?''

There is structural long-term growth in the industry.\" **********Driving much of that growth is the fact that governments, especially in large countries like France and Germany, are making it easier for companies to hire and fire. **********\"With respect to labor reform, there are a lot of reasons to be confident,\" Mr. MacLeod said. \"In Germany, maximum lengths of contracts have been extended for temporary workers, and in Italy, temporary employment has been legalized. There will be huge structural change in the next five years.\" **********Staffing-company placements represent 1.5 percent of European workers, compared with 2.0 percent in the United States. With labor-market restrictions easing in Europe and strong economic growth, they may rapidly increase that proportion to up to 10 percent, said Boris Bernstein of Goldman Sachs. **********The industry has undergone a change in the way investors perceive it. Roger Monson, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Europe, said that the industry used to be viewed as countercyclical, with profits and share prices rising as economies were pulling out of recession. **********\"The countercyclical argument had it that during slow economic times companies would make more use of temps, since they would not want to commit to permanent staff until long-term demand picked up,\" he said. **********The industry is now seen as being more in phase with the economy, and with the European economy apparently in a sustained period of growth, investors are interested. \"The industry as a whole is very much a long-term growth sector,\" Mr. MacLeod said. **********That is especially so for specialty staffing companies in industries such as engineering, information technology and accounting. These, he said, \"are growing much faster and tend to have higher margins\" than generalist firms. Because their growth is not as robust, general staffing companies \u2014 the ones that employ secretaries, bookkeepers and so forth \u2014 tend to be more susceptible to economic swings. **********Yet despite the apparent advantages of operating in high-growth niches, specialty firms are more cheaply priced, trading at just over 30 times last year's earnings, compared with a multiple of 40 for general companies. **********Those are rich valuations \u2014 rich enough to warrant caution, analysts said. **********\"Longer term, the group will continue to be promising,\" Mr. Bernstein said. \"They're not cheap, but given the growth outlook and how cash-generative they are, they're reasonable value. **********\"But you have to believe we won't see the economic cycle turn in the next two years,\" he added. \"If we do get an economic downturn, they could be bad investments\" **********Mr. Bernstein has a \"trading buy\" on Content NV, a Dutch general-staffing company that carries a significantly lower valuation than its peers after a drop in its share price. **********Among others in the general sector, he rates Adecco SA of Switzerland a \"market outperformer\" and gives Randstad NV of the Netherlands a weaker \"market performer\" opinion. **********The British specialty company Select Appointments (Holdings) PLC draws an \"outperformer\" rating. It had been on Goldman's recommended list, but fell from grace when its shares reached a stiff \u00a39 ($14.60).

The decline marked the second consecutive quarter of negative growth, the definition given by most economists for recession. **********John Dodsworth opened offices in Seoul in March as senior representative for the International Monetary Fund, monitoring how well the country was living up to the requirements set by the IMF in piecing together a rescue package of nearly $60 billion last December. Mr. Dodsworth discussed South Korea's economy and outlook Thursday with the International Herald Tribune's Don Kirk . **********Q. Why does the economy appear to be suffering even more now than last December when the IMF pieced together its rescue package? **********A. The external situation is very much worse than people expected. It appears to extend across the whole of Asia, and Russia is a further factor. Japan is clearly crucial. **********Q. What about increased exports as a solution? **********A. In the past Korea could export its way out. That's what it's been good at over the years. The previous scenario would have had exports playing a prominent part. Domestic confidence and consumption would be better. When you have bleak outside conditions, it's hard to get confidence. Ultimately, you're much less certain about an external stimulus to help Korea to get out of the crisis. **********Q. Are large companies making matters worse by not importing the raw materials and capital goods needed to produce finished products for export? **********A. The main exports are not liquid at this point. If they have exports they can sell, if there is demand, they're going to bring in the imports. Over the years they're taken big risks, and they've done really well. **********- **********Q. What's stopping them now from exporting so effectively? **********A. The markets have been shrinking most of all in Asia, and there's much more competition for markets in the United States and Europe. **********Q. What can the government do to improve matters in South Korea? **********A. We're encouraging the government to expand its fiscal deficit. It can spend it mainly on helping the workers who are unemployed and in public works \u2014 anything which will generate more employment and create more consumption. **********Q. What can the government do for the people who have lost jobs? **********A. In the first half of the year, the targets were not met, particularly for the unemployed. **********One of the things is for the government to spend on social safety. The employment insurance scheme covers 30 percent of the labor force. The maximum duration of benefits is seven months. **********Q. Does the government have the funds to increase welfare benefits? **********A. They have the money. There's no problem in having resources. The problem is having sufficient capacity, in particular for those who fall outside the social welfare system. I think they will want to give this priority. **********How quickly they can do it is the question. They're on the right track, but it's still got a long way to go. **********Q. How about restructuring institutions? **********A. Substantive changes are painful. The first priority is to carry through the banking system reform and reform of the nonbank financial institutions. There need to be less banks, better run and better managed, less workers and fewer branches. **********Bank mergers per se will not save the situation, but a bank merger combined with real change in the operation of the bank plus some form of recapitalization is a good model for restructuring the banking system. **********- **********Q. Are the big chaebol, or conglomerates, still getting loans from their favorite banks? **********A. There should be much better credit appraisal. They have learned some lessons about credit appraisal. That's why much of the banking system is under criticism, for not extending credit. The risk in lending to the biggest chaebol is much less than lending to your friend down the road. The big chaebol get most of the credit. **********Q. People here are always talking about the \"big deal\" \u2014 mergers among companies belonging to the major chaebol \u2014 as a solution to the problem of oversized and unprofitable companies. Is the \"big deal\" the answer? **********A. There should be more of an emphasis on the debts not just of the big-five chaebol but of all the chaebol. That's the key to the banking sector restructuring. If you continue to have highly leveraged corporations, you continue to have banking problems. These two aspects of restructuring are very closely related. You start off with the banks which can place pressure on the debtors. The two things have to come up together. Somewhat in the lead is bank restructuring. **********Q. Somehow, after chaebol go bankrupt or apply for receivership or whatever, they remain in business. How long can the money-losers survive after they have supposedly failed? **********A. You will see much more in terms of restructuring of the chaebol to reduce the nonprofitable ones. The bankruptcy laws have been changed so it is possible to move more quickly through that bankruptcy procedure. It's much better to get rid of anybody who is inefficient. **********Q. Will companies be able to lay off workers without encountering great union resistance, as was the case at Hyundai Motor Co.? **********A. More layoffs are unavoidable. The labor market was not developed at all in Korea. The law now gives rights to both sides. Probably enough has been done in terms of the legal situation. Unemployment here entails a lot more hardship than elsewhere, but it's difficult to see how companies can survive, can maintain the same labor force if the demand for their products falls away. **********Q. How has the government been doing in terms of opening up the economy to foreigners? **********A. They made great steps in the first six months. The liberalization measures were very radical in the Korean context, opening up the stock market and the bond market, allowing foreigners to own land, allowing hostile M&As. They put together a liberal framework for allowing foreign investment. **********Q. Foreigners are not buying that much. Why not? **********A. There is less in the way of resources. They would like to see more coming in. It's not the ideal circumstances within which to attract foreign investment. **********Q. How do you feel when you hear Koreans talking about \"the IMF crisis\" as if the IMF were responsible for it? **********A. There's an undercurrent that the IMF in some way is to blame. By diverting attention from anything wrong to begin with, you're putting the solution further away. Almost anything bad happening gets the epithet \"IMF.\" I have a problem with that. It's an attempt to divert from the crisis. **********Q. How do you feel when you see signs advertising \"IMF sale\" and even \"IMF lunch?\" **********A. I go for the IMF menu every time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/business/business-digest-460494.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 539, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Profits Strong at 3 Airlines, But T.W.A.

''And I have a certain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism.'' **********As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyan authorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Mr. Cuisenier to take the same step. It was not until three years ago that Libya even established a Ministry of Tourism. **********Under United Nations sanctions, which prohibit international flights, the only way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry. **********Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88,000 visitors, about one-third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt in an average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that even this number may be inflated. **********But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, has nevertheless now pronounced tourism to be ''the industry of the 21st century.'' And if real and psychological barriers could be removed, one diplomat said, ''the potential is absolutely stunning.'' **********Scattered along Libya's 1,100-mile Mediterranean coast are Greek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of the region's richest archeological treasures. **********Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was first inhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and also boasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920's by Italians. **********The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes to Tripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100,000 people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage Site. **********The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanest in the Mediterranean. The vast desert includes another World Heritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 miles south of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4,000 years ago by the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population. In Wadi Mathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be found that date from neolithic times. **********Slowly, Government officials say, they are making progress in luring visitors to such sites. A crowd that gathered recently for a cultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin. **********Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious about a land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing to endure the five-hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, the nearest international airport. **********Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necks are no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although both are still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost their appetite for crowds. **********''It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places,'' said Francois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France. ''What I like most is that I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I can have some peace.'' **********Mohammed Gattus, Libya's Under Secretary of Tourism, said that a recent two-day conference held in Tripoli was intended to help train local tour operators in order to put the industry ''on a sound foundation.'' **********But as Mr. Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles to travel within Libya -- particularly by independent visitors -- remain considerable. **********The official exchange rate is wildly inflated. Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car. One effect of the United Nations sanctions -- imposed since 1992 because of Libya's refusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner -- has been to ground most of the country's domestic air fleet. **********At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has been relatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, declares that their country is a ''state of the masses,'' has created what Mr. Cuisenier described as ''not exactly a service-oriented economy.'' **********Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and if the United Nations sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become big business. And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful that animosity from the West, and particularly from the United States, has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions. **********''My message is simple: we cannot ignore America,'' Salah el-Fathali, the executive director of the National Cancer Institute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visiting French doctors around the Sabratha site.

Not by any stretch. **********What the Government did this week -- filing a suit that called Microsoft a predatory monopolist, using its dominance of personal computer operating systems to control future innovations -- may be the antitrust action that defines commerce for much of the next century. **********But, perhaps because there is just so much money floating around this region as a result of Microsoft, people here say they feel no immediate threat from the Justice Department. What you hear is defiance, denial, and even the celebrated hubris. **********Microsoft will fight the Justice Department, according to a dominant view from its hometown, because fighting -- and winning -- is what Microsoft does best. **********''If anything, this is going to fuel the already heightened competitiveness of the company,'' said Scott Oki, who was one of the first 100 Microsoft employees, and now devotes his time to giving away much of his fortune and developing golf courses. ''They will just hunker down and be that much better at what they do.'' **********As for his view of the antitrust suit, Mr. Oki said, ''I think it's preposterous, wrongheaded, misdirected and just plain dumb.'' **********Microsoft, based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, has produced a half-dozen billionaires, more than 2,000 millionaires -- most of whom would not draw a stare at the mini-mart -- and is in large part responsible for Seattle being one of the costlier places to own a home in America. But this is not a company town. **********Microsoft, with about 12,000 employees, is only the fourth-largest employer, behind Boeing, Group Health Cooperative and the University of Washington. When Boeing shed two-thirds of its work force during a sharp recession 30 years ago, a famous sign implored the last person leaving town to turn out the lights. **********Now, the reaction to an outside threat is one of calculation as the holders of Microsoft stock study how the Justice Department suit affects their investment. ''I have friends who worked at the phone company when they broke up, and they're watching their portfolios sail along,'' said Laura Ruderman, who left Microsoft two months ago after five years at the company. **********Microsoft, according to the consensus view around Seattle, is no turn-of-the-century Standard Oil, a Goliath ripe for breakup. And even if it were, some people say, it is worth recalling what the aging John D. Rockefeller said upon hearing that his oil monopoly was over: He told people to buy Standard Oil stock, saying it would be worth more when divided into parts, as indeed it was. **********''No one's cashing in their stock options,'' said Julie Bick, a former group product manager at the company and author of a recent book, ''All I Really Need to Know in Business I Learned at Microsoft'' (Pocket Books). She said that the company was being punished simply for being successful. ''It's kind of like telling a slugger on the baseball team not to hit for the fences,'' Ms. Bick said. **********Valerie Carbonaro of Redmond, who was shopping at a boutique in Redmond yesterday, said, ''In some respects I agree with the smaller companies because Microsoft has got the market. But it's part of the American way. Bill Gates started it from scratch and got it to where it is today.'' **********That view extends to the Governor of the state, Gary Locke, a Democrat. ''I don't think people or companies should be targeted by the Government just because they're smart and innovative,'' Governor Locke said. ''You have to wonder if Microsoft is being attacked because of its success and its brains.'' **********Justice Department lawyers and Microsoft rivals say that the company has repeatedly broken antitrust laws. They say the company has used its dominance in software operating systems -- roughly 90 percent of all personal computers run on Microsoft systems -- to stifle competition in other areas, mainly in its moves to take over the market for Internet browsers, which allow computer users to connect to the millions of sites on the World Wide Web. If successful in doing this, the critics add, a small percentage of virtually every commercial transaction on the Internet will end up in the hands of the merchants at Microsoft. **********For all its hometown rooters, there are also plenty of critics of the company here, and Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, is a regular target of vicious local satire. It seems obvious, people say with a shrug, why Mr. Gates -- whose Microsoft stock alone is worth around $47 billion -- keeps personal papers from Napoleon, the man who once had designs on much of the world, among the artifacts usually on display at his new $40 million home on Lake Washington. **********The money from Microsoft has clearly transformed this region. Outside of the Silicon Valley in California, the Puget Sound area -- along with the Boston area -- has the highest concentration of software companies in the nation, many dependent on Microsoft. Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, has been acting as a sports and arts Medici, buying a professional football team, nearly a third of all the office space in the southern end of downtown Seattle, and building a huge new music museum. He is also, with the help of taxpayers, constructing a professional football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks, the team he owns. **********Other residents have also become more active in charitable giving. **********''We set a record this year for the biggest increase in United Way donations of any city,'' said Bob Watt, a former Seattle deputy mayor who is the chief executive of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce. ''The biggest increase in categories was those who gave over $10,000 apiece. And the incentive was, anyone who donated that got to have dinner with Bill and Melinda Gates. That's a small example of what this company means to this area.'' **********But with Microsoft being only the fourth-largest employer, Mr. Watt said, few people are concerned about the Justice Department's action. ''Most of the software executives I've spoken to have been saying this is not Armageddon,'' he said. **********Still, being accused of unlawful behavior raises the question of whether Microsoft will be hurt by its cutthroat image. The answer, at least on Microsoft's home turf, was no. **********''Lawsuits are not what they used to be,'' said Bruce Chapman, president of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank. ''People used to say where there's smoke, there's fire. Now they say, where there's smoke, there's a smoke machine.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/16/business/company-news-whx-plans-offer-for-global-industrial-technologies.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-12-16", "snippet": "WHX Corp to make hostile tender offer of $10.25 a share in cash, or total of $208 million, for Global Industrial Technologies Inc (S)", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHX PLANS OFFER FOR GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; WHX PLANS OFFER FOR GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES", "body_text": " **********The WHX Corporation said yesterday that it planned to make a hostile tender offer of $10.25 a share in cash, or a total of $208 million, for Global Industrial Technologies Inc.

Such shoppers' buying behavior is often emulated by mainstream consumers. **********''We keep extending the boundaries from painters and sculptors,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''to folk artists, fashion designers, writers, photographers, architects, interior designers -- and now window designers.'' **********''There's a business proposition here as well,'' he added, ''because you're talking about people who are image makers and taste formers.'' **********Mr. Doonan, who joined Barneys in 1986 and has worked diligently to keep the windows shining through the bankruptcy of parent Barney's Inc., demurs at being included in those ranks. **********''Windows are a really weird form of creative expression,'' he said. ''Because they change every bloody week, it's hard to think of anything more ephemeral. And they're a form of free entertainment that is disappearing as retailers cut back on promoting their images on the street.'' **********''Absolut started off with a lot of hard-core 'artists,' '' he added, ''so recognizing someone with one foot planted firmly in commerce and the other in creative makes me proud.'' **********Mr. Doonan pronounced himself ''very happy with the ad'' because ''it looks and feels like a Barneys window.'' That was, however, not without its difficulties. **********''It took us two goes to get the shoulder of the Absolut bottle right,'' Mr. Doonan said. ''The first time it looked like an English milk bottle.'' (He ought to know, having been born in Reading, England.) **********The idea for the ad came from discussions Mr. Doonan had with Seagram about the book tour for his humorous autobiography, ''Confessions of a Window Dresser: Tales from a Life in Fashion,'' to be published next month by Penguin Studio and Callaway Editions Inc. He has previously participated in Absolut promotional events that included a Barneys window co-sponsored with Vogue magazine in 1996 and a recent fund-raiser to fight AIDS. **********''People love to watch windows being pulled together,'' Mr. Doonan said. ''The idea is that the bottle grew out of a manic session with a lot of crazed window dressers, in whose ranks I include myself.'' **********Mr. Doonan is best known for the colorful Barneys Christmas windows that simultaneously embrace and tweak self-promotional celebrities from Madonna and Prince to Dolly Parton and Ivana Trump. Is a man who so loves to throw a spanner, as the British call a wrench, into the star-making machinery now stepping through the looking glass -- or window glass -- to embrace that which he cheekily sends up? **********Those who ''think I want to end up like Cindy Adams'' are wrong, Mr. Doonan declared, adding: ''I'm a ninth-string celebrity. I don't have a desire to self-promote other than for God's Love to get a lot of money.'' His reference was to God's Love We Deliver, the charity to which he will donate his royalties from the book. **********Asked to explain some of the stranger objects in the ad, Mr. Doonan laughed and replied: ''A lot of them were lying around our display studio. We put them in because people like to look at a window and say 'I wonder what that means.' '' **********In other words, as Mr. Doonan put it, ''Sometimes a trumpet is just a display prop.'' **********The ''Absolut Doonan'' ad is to appear in the November issues of these magazines, Mr. Lewis said: Allure, Chicago Social, In Style, Interview, New York, Out, Paper and W. Plans call for the ad to return in January, after the annual Absolut holiday ad, in other titles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/05/world/argentina-to-seek-extradition-of-2-executives-from-us.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1998-05-05", "snippet": "Argentina will seek extradition from US of two current and two former IBM executives, amid allegations that company gave Government officials up to $21 million in bribes in exchange for lucrative bank contract (M)", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentina to Seek Extradition Of 2 Executives From U.S.", "print_headline": "Argentina to Seek Extradition Of 2 Executives From U.S.", "body_text": " **********An Argentine federal judge investigating allegations that I.B.M. gave Government officials up to $21 million in bribes in exchange for a lucrative bank contract said tonight that he would seek the extradition of two current and two former I.B.M. executives if they refused to come to Buenos Aires to testify voluntarily. **********''They know they are implicated here, and that's why they don't want to come,'' Judge Adolfo Bagnasco said.

He noted that last week Ricardo Martorana and Gustavo Soriani, the former president and vice president of I.B.M.'s Argentine operations, testified that their supervisors in the United States had total control over the contract negotiations. Meanwhile, a former Banco de la Nacion executive was the first official to say that he had accepted a payoff, of more than $1 million, as a sign of I.B.M.'s appreciation. **********Two of the four people sought by Judge Bagnasco, who supervised the company's Argentina operations at the time of the payoffs, still work for the company.

They brought worldwide condemnation to a country that had long preached the gospel of peace, with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee proclaiming India to be the possessor of ''the capacity for a big bomb'' that had given it a new measure of international power. **********But as the test series ended, many Indians concluded that the repercussions abroad, including severe economic sanctions imposed by the United States, could be matched by similarly far-reaching political effects at home. **********In effect, those Indians said, Mr. Vajpayee, in approving the tests and winning the support of more than 90 percent of Indians in opinion polls, has struck a powerful blow against the opposition parties, rearranging the political landscape in the nationalists' favor. **********The tests' political effects were suggested by a columnist today in The Asian Age, a newspaper that has supported the nuclear tests but warned against India's sliding into ''jingoism.'' The writer, Seema Mustafa, a Muslim, said the Hindu nationalists were riding a tidal wave of support. **********''To express a doubt about the political wisdom of this decision is to risk being dubbed an anti-national, and if you carry a Muslim name, as this columnist does, it will probably be sufficient to throw you across the other side of the border,'' Ms. Mustafa wrote, referring to Pakistan. **********Only 10 weeks ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party that Mr. Vajpayee leads, the B.J.P., emerged from a general election with its best showing in 50 years of Hindu nationalist electioneering -- 171 seats in the 545-seat lower house of Parliament. For a nationalist movement long tarred by its link to the Hindu fanatic who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the independence leader, it was a moment of historic vindication, and enough for the nationalists to put together a governing coalition of 14 parties. **********But the election showed the Hindu nationalists' weaknesses, too. Essentially, they remained a movement rooted in an arc of populous Hindi-speaking states in the country's north and west, known in India as the cow-belt states because of the region's strict adherence to Hindu traditions of cow worship. In at least 16 of India's 25 states, the nationalists remained political outsiders, dependent on alliances of convenience with regional allies that have a history of hostility with the nationalists. **********Yet the election had been held in circumstances that favored the nationalists. The Congress Party, which governed India for 44 years but is increasingly rudderless and corrupt, staved off a rout only by drafting Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born heir to the legacy of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, as campaign leader. The only other contender, the United Front, a broad coalition of leftist and regional parties, was discredited by its chaotic performance in national government in the 20 months after a 1996 general election. **********Still, the nationalists won the support of only 26 percent of the 345 million voters, and clawed their way into government only by scrapping measures intended to shift India from its secular tradition toward a new era of dominance for the country's Hindu majority of 700 million people. **********Among other things, the nationalists were forced to set aside a potentially incendiary plan to build a Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on the site of an ancient mosque that a nationalist mob razed in 1992, an event that set off the worst Hindu-Muslim rioting since 1947. **********Events in the new Government's first two months in office did not favor the nationalists. Mr. Vajpayee was depicted by newspapers as a ''toothless tiger'' as his Government was buffeted by internal feuding, and by a relentless series of demands for special treatment. They included the quashing of criminal charges by a 27-seat parliamentary group loyal to Jayalalitha Jayaram, a former movie actress who was ousted from power in Tamil Nadu state in 1996 amid accusations that she and her associates had looted state coffers. **********Indian political commentators predicted that the nationalists might be discredited for failing to fulfill their campaign promise to provide a stable administration that would break with the ramshackle governments of the past. After abandoning Hindutva, a term that refers to the notion that India should be a Hindu state, the promise of stability was their main plank. To many middle-class, upper-caste Indians who are the nationalists' political backbone, ''good governance'' was far more important than razing mosques. **********But quietly, the Vajpayee Government was taking steps to entrench its power. The governors of several key states were replaced with known supporters of the far-right nationalist group that many regard as the real power behind the Government, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S. Bureaucrats with Hindu nationalist sympathies were moved into top posts in key ministries in New Delhi and the states. Rumors abounded of plans to use national powers to dismiss inconvenient state governments, including the one in Tamil Nadu that has prosecuted Ms. Jayaram. **********The most important move of all, the decision to carry out the nuclear tests, was apparently made as soon as Mr. Vajpayee took office on March 19. Indian newspapers have reported that top nuclear officials, including A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, regarded as the father of the Indian bomb, met with Mr. Vajpayee the same day, and left smiling broadly. About the same time, villagers in the area around Pokharan, where the tests were held, began seeing a step-up of military activity, especially at night, in sand storms and in bad weather, when American and Russian spy satellites would be blinded. **********Much else is speculation. But many Indians were surprised by how openly the R.S.S. leadership displayed its influence over the new Government, many of whose leaders, including Mr. Vajpayee, are longtime party stalwarts. Key Cabinet appointments were blocked, or approved, by the group's leaders, who announced that they would keep a close watch on the new Government.  Mr. Vajpayee has said the tests were motivated by a concern for India's national security, not by partisan considerations. But in an interview published on Friday by India Today, a news magazine, he hinted at the political benefits that nationalists expect to reap. **********''Millions of Indians have viewed this occasion as the beginning of the rise of a strong and self-confident India,'' he said. ''I fully share this assessment and this dream.'' **********In another interview, with Outlook magazine, Mr. Vajpayee said ''no more nuclear tests'' were planned by the Government, Agence France-Presse reported today. **********Opposition leaders have said the nationalists may be planning to rush into a new election in the hope of winning a parliamentary majority, something Mr. Vajpayee has denied. In any case, the nationalists could be blocked by India's Constitution, since President K. R. Narayan would be obliged to ask other parties in the current Parliament to form a new coalition. Mrs. Gandhi, the Congress Party leader, would almost certainly seek to lead a new government, pushing the nationalists into opposition. **********But few doubt that the tests have created a new vulnerability for the opposition groups. One faction of the Communist Party condemned the tests as a breach of faith with India's poor, but almost every other group lined up with the Government. United Front leaders who led the last Government hastened to say they would have approved the tests if they had been re-elected, and Mrs. Gandhi, after dithering for four days, issued a statement of support, calling the testing ''a national issue'' that precluded partisan dissent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/06/business/company-news-bank-of-new-york-plans-to-buy-80-of-everen-clearing.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-08-06", "snippet": "Bank of New York Corp to acquire 80 percent of Everen Clearing Corp; terms undisclosed (S)", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK OF NEW YORK PLANS TO BUY 80% OF EVEREN CLEARING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BANK OF NEW YORK PLANS TO BUY 80% OF EVEREN CLEARING", "body_text": " **********The Bank of New York Company agreed yesterday to acquire an 80 percent stake in the Everen Clearing Corporation.

AMRO contended that if Generale accepted the Fortis offer, it would be largely confined to a Belgian niche and left unprepared to deal with the restructuring and consolidation of the financial market caused by the adoption of the single currency in January. **********Fortis partisans, on the other hand, asserted that by accepting the AMRO bid, Generale would have become the subsidiary of a Dutch subsidiary of a Dutch holding company, and would have quickly lost its own identity. **********Explaining why its directors had sided with Fortis, Generale de Banque said AMRO would strive for \"the dismemberment or sale to outsiders of various strategic activities.\" The Dutch group, it said, would have sold Generale's Dutch unit, absorbed its investment banking operations, centralized treasury operations in Amsterdam and taken direct control of units in Switzerland and Hong Kong. **********Fortis, on the other hand, would focus its banking business on Generale de Banque and \"maintain its integrity and the consolidation in Belgium of an autonomous decision-making center,\" Generale de Banque said. **********AMRO denied that its bid had been hostile and said it had been the victim of special interests that were determined to keep Generale de Banque in Belgian hands. **********\"In the context of business relations in Belgium, factors play a role that clearly prevent a free, economic choice for all shareholders in this case,\" it said. **********AMRO said it made no economic sense to try to match an improved offer by Fortis, after Generale de Banque directors approved their poison pill \u2014 a 10 percent increase in capital \u2014 to help Fortis win its bid. **********Fortis improved its offer Friday, raising it 16.2 percent higher than its original offer three weeks ago.

Now Ms. Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School here, and Erwin Chemerinsky, another analyst and law professor at the University of Southern California, are calling for a special code of ethics to combat legal commentary they say fails to educate the public and brings disrepute to the bar. **********So the city that served as main stage for the sensational trials of the police officers who beat Mr. King, O. J. Simpson and the Menendez brothers -- and created a small industry for legal analysis in the process -- is now driving a fledgling debate over what standards those analysts should work by. Lawyers being lawyers, few concur on the answer. **********''I'm not so sure you could get everyone to agree on the same issues,'' said Roger Cossack, co-host of the CNN program ''Burden of Proof,'' ''so it may be an impossibility to get it done.'' **********The proposal by Ms. Levenson and Mr. Chemerinsky, framed as a voluntary measure to avoid any First Amendment problems, asks commentators to refrain from predicting the outcome of a trial or acting like a scorekeeper watching a sporting match. It also asks lawyers to state points of law and facts of a case accurately, avoid conflicts of interest like providing trial strategies to a lawyer involved in the case the commentator is following. It also asks lawyers -- believe it or not -- to closely follow a case in order to comment on it. **********The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the largest criminal defense lawyers organization in the country with 10,000 members, discussed adopting a code based on the professors' work during a meeting in New York in November, but the opposition was visceral and the group divided, and prospects for its ultimate approval are in question. The organization will consider a new proposal at a meeting this week in Santa Monica, Calif., this one a more basic version drafted by Barry Scheck, a frequent commentator who represented Mr. Simpson in his criminal trial. Mr. Scheck said he hoped the group would find this version more palatable. **********Some opponents say guidelines are unnecessary and toothless while others fear a violation of free speech. Some say it would be better to set guidelines for television interviewers who put silly questions to lawyers. **********''I suppose who you should really aim at are the networks who call in people to comment on the five o'clock news and six o'clock news and ask the questions they ask,'' Mr. Cossack said. **********Gerry Spence, a defense lawyer and frequent commentator, says he plans to skip the meeting altogether. **********''Codes of ethics don't make lawyers better,'' he said. ''A bad lawyer will find a way to break a code of ethics. I guess we need them for guidelines, but they don't help much.'' **********Proponents of the code are troubled by lawyers in criminal cases coming back as commentators in subsequent related civil cases, as occurred with several lawyers -- prosecution and defense -- in the Simpson case, although they do not seek to curtail such practices. **********They say that raises the danger that lawyers will accidentally let slip client confidences, or not provide frank and candid legal analysis for the public. They also say lawyers' failure to closely follow a case leads to outright mistakes on the air. Peter Arenella, a University of California at Los Angeles law professor and commentator for ABC during the Simpson criminal case, decries a widespread practice of legal commentators relying on media versions of courtroom events to then analyze the proceedings. **********Johnnie L. Cochran, a Simpson defender and now host of the Court TV show Cochran & Company, agrees an ethics code is needed but also says the onus should be on networks to hire experienced and informed trial lawyers. **********Mr. Scheck said: ''This draft is important because the duty of competence is what the nature of media constantly undermines.

Needless to say, Mr. Killinger has lots of fans on Wall Street. **********''He is an indefatigible guy with enormous energy and optimism,'' Mr. Tejera of Dain Rauscher said. ''Since he took over in 1990, his stock is the best-performing issue among banks and major thrifts. He has made a lot of people wealthy.'' **********Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company who once referred to Mr. Killinger as the ''Alexander the Great of the thrift industry,'' said ''the highest rate of return for a bank or thrift is to acquire competitors in the same market.'' He added, ''That is a concept he understands well.'' **********A native of Des Moines and a graduate of the University of Iowa, where he earned B.A. and M.B.A. degrees in less than four years, Mr. Killinger displayed a penchant for doing deals before he ever got to Washington Mutual. **********After a brief stint as an investment analyst at the Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska, Mr. Killinger took a position at Murphey Favre Inc., a Spokane-based brokerage firm. To augment his income in support of his young family, he began buying fixer-upper homes and restoring them on weekends. **********Mr. Killinger was no less entrepreneurial at Murphey Favre. A successful mutual fund manager, he acquired a large stake in the privately held firm by buying stock from retiring co-workers. In 1982, he helped to broker the sale of Murphey Favre to Washington Mutual. He was named president in 1988 and chief executive two years later. **********Through his big stock holdings in Washington Mutual, he has become an extremely wealthy man; analysts estimate he is worth $100 million or more. **********Analysts say it does not appear likely that he will sit on its laurels after the Ahmanson deal. **********Ahmanson operates some 40 branches in the Houston area, and Mr. Tejera from Dain Rauscher said he expected Washington Mutual to use that as a beachhead to acquire more properties in Texas. **********''With the Ahmanson deal they will be in a number of Western states, Florida and Texas,'' he said. ''But there is no doubt in my mind that Kerry Killinger has national aspirations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/21/business/company-reports-ibm-says-profit-rose-10-but-warns-of-uncertainties.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1998-10-21", "snippet": "IBM reports 10 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, but company's executives warn that global economic uncertainty could lead to short-term problems in months ahead; posts profit of $1.49 billion compared with $1.56 billion in year-earlier ...", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

Revenue for the period increased 8 percent, to $20.1 billion. **********The results were slightly above analysts' expectations of $1.53 a share, and the anticipation of a strong quarter had pushed the company's stock up $10 over the last week, to a new 52-week intraday high of $142.4375 yesterday before retreating. The stock fell $1.50, to $137.875, before the third-quarter earnings were announced. **********Behind the numbers is a mixed business story. The company's sales of hardware, from its giant mainframes to personal computers, increased by 4.2 percent, to $8.7 billion. This is a turnaround from the first half of 1998, when a glut of personal computers and delays in mainframe purchases hurt sales. **********The company's information technology services segment, which provides software and computer equipment services to corporations, was also strong, with revenue rising by 22.6 percent, to $5.7 billion. (I.B.M. does not release earnings results for individual business segments.) The company attributed this rise to a desire by corporations to improve computer-related business efficiencies when faced with an economic downturn. **********On the negative side, however, was a decline in business in Asia and Latin America along with continued problems in the company's microelectronics business, which reflects severe price competition in the manufacture of computer memory chips. **********''While I.B.M. is entering the fourth quarter with some real momentum,'' said Louis V. Gerstner Jr.,  the company's chairman and chief executive, ''we are facing a number of significant short-term issues, including an uncertain global economic environment, ongoing weaknesses in some parts of Asia and Latin America and continued price pressures in semiconductors.'' **********With strong earnings against a backdrop of business uncertainty, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, Douglas L. Maine, warned in a conference call with analysts against overly optimistic fourth-quarter earnings estimates. **********''While we are pleased with our strong third-quarter performance,'' he said, ''economic uncertainties should lead to a conclusion not to raise earnings estimates.'' **********David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal & Company, said: ''The good news is that I.B.M. wasn't hit as bad as what the worst fears might have indicated. I'm conservative, and I've expected the company to get hit with some economic fallout. But it just hasn't happened yet.'' **********Gary Helmig, an analyst at Soundview Technology Group, said, ''Loud and clear, we got a lot of good news.'' **********''They certainly had a strong revenue performance and they are well positioned in Europe and North America for a sustained performance,'' he added. ''Still, with currency risks and with the world economic scene, we'd all be better off to watch and see how it unfolds rather than taking the good news of the moment and increasing our expectations. That's the prudent approach.'' **********With a cost reduction program in place, most of the increase in revenue fell to the bottom line. Still, the company's gross profit margin of 37.2 percent in the 1998 third quarter fell slightly, compared with 38.2 percent in the quarter a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/15/business/magazine-set-to-auction-art-collection.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1998-09-15", "snippet": "Financially troubled Reader's Digest Association, owner of exceptional art collection, will be selling estimated $100 million of Impressionist and 20th-century works by masters at public auction in November; while Sotheby's and Reader's Digest ref...", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Magazine Set To Auction Art Collection", "print_headline": "Magazine Set To Auction Art Collection", "body_text": " **********The financially troubled Reader's Digest Association, owner of an exceptional art collection, will be selling an estimated $100 million of Impressionist and 20th-century works by masters like Cezanne, Monet, Modigliani and Matisse at public auction in New York in November, several experts close to the negotiations said yesterday. **********While both Sotheby's and Reader's Digest refused to comment, art experts said that the York Avenue auction house had been chosen to sell the works in a special evening sale during the height of the fall art season. The auction is a big coup for Sotheby's, which competed fiercely for it against its archrival, Christie's. But the choice, experts said, was an obvious one, since Sotheby's has been working with Reader's Digest for years, doing its appraisals and last May selling two paintings -- a Monet and a van Gogh -- which totaled $6.2 million. Around the same time, Reader's Digest also sold a Braque still life privately. **********This fall, the best of Reader's Digest art holdings -- works carefully collected by the publisher's founders, Lila Acheson Wallace and her husband, DeWitt Wallace, since the 1940's -- will be up for sale. The highlights of the collection include two Modigliani portraits, a Matisse still life, a Cezanne landscape, two Monets -- a landscape the artist painted while he was at Vetheuil and one of the artist's famous waterlilies -- and a van Gogh, which the artist painted in Auvers-sur-Oise in 1890. **********The decision to sell this season is partly timed to take advantage of the strong prices realized at auctions of the last several years. The company is hardly the first corporation to sell its art at Sotheby's. In recent years, both I.B.M. and CBS, under financial pressure, sold parts of their collections. I.B.M.'s most valuable American paintings brought record prices when they were offered three years ago. CBS also made money selling about 100 works of contemporary art two years ago. **********But Reader's Digest is under enormous pressure to improve its performance because the company's results have been very disappointing over the last several years. **********Today, under its new chairman and chief executive, Thomas O. Ryder, its financial situation is somewhat better than several months ago, when it had a negative net worth. Not only has it sold some art, but it has also laid off some staff and closed some operations. Still, its $100 million in cash is a far cry from the flush days when the Reader's Digest balance sheet carried $700 million in cash. At its late 1992 high, the stock traded at $56.375 a share. It closed yesterday at $17.6875. **********''The company can meet its debt obligations, but they need capital to fund new ventures,'' said Mandana Hormozi, an analyst at Lazard Freres & Company. **********Ms. Hormozi and other analysts greeted the news of the pending sale of art as a positive for the company and noted that Mr. Ryder had said a sale was likely and that nothing was any longer sacred at the company. The previous chief executive, George V. Grune, had been reluctant to sell the collection. **********Though analysts are impressed with Mr. Ryder's no-nonsense approach -- not only has he already sold several pieces of art, he has also sold the corporate jet -- Reader's Digest's problems are deep. **********The books and home entertainment products are still not getting strong responses to mailings, Ms. Hormozi said. And the revenue for the magazine is down, in large part because of currency fluctuations. In addition, Reader's Digest failed to meet its rate base to advertisers of 15 million readers in 1998, delivering 14.7 million. Under these circumstances it is not unusual for publications to give advertisers free space to compensate for the readers they paid for but did not get. **********Ms. Hormozi said that she had scaled back her expectations for the 1999 fiscal year, which will end June 30, from strong growth to moderate growth. However she and other analysts said they were waiting to hear Mr. Ryder's extensive presentation to analysts scheduled for tomorrow. **********The company has a unique structure. About 71 percent of its voting stock is held by two charitable foundations established by the Wallaces. Underneath the big foundations are seven charitable funds, each of which supports a major cultural institution. The funds once owned a total of 42 percent of the nonvoting shares. However, Reader's Digest cut its dividend last year, and with the stock doing poorly, some funds lobbied for, and received, the right to sell some stock."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/15/business/the-media-business-outbid-on-pro-football-nbc-retains-er-in-record-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1998-01-15", "snippet": "NBC reportedly agrees to pay Warner Brothers about $13 million an episode for television program ER over next three years for total of over $850 million, making series most expensive television show ever; deal reflects pressure on networks to reta...", "word_count": 1206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Outbid on Pro Football, NBC Retains 'E.R.' in Record Pact", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Outbid on Pro Football, NBC Retains 'E.R.' in Record Pact", "body_text": " **********NBC agreed today to a deal to pay Warner Brothers, the studio that owns the drama ''E.R.,'' about $13 million an episode over the next three years for a total of more than $850 million, making the medical series the most expensive television show ever. **********The deal came a day after the National Football League concluded the richest television deal in history, a $17.6 billion deal with three networks, not including NBC. **********Taken together the deals showed how the television networks, weakened by losses of viewers to cable channels, feel compelled to pay once- unheard of prices to retain the few programs that generate consistently large audiences. The NBC agreement comes close to tripling what the network had agreed to pay earlier this year for what turned out to be the last season of its hit comedy series ''Seinfeld.'' **********Many network executives said in interviews here that the crushing programming costs were likely to lead networks to increase their efforts to own or control every program they put on the air. **********NBC announced it had concluded negotiations with Warner Brothers to hold onto television's most popular show without giving any financial details. But several executives on both sides of the negotiations said the price was $13 million an episode, a figure that exceeded even early predictions that it could go as high as $10 million. **********The show features an attractive cast of young doctors and nurses working in a Chicago hospital emergency room. It is the most valuable property in television for numerous reasons, beginning with its high ratings and the attractive makeup of its audience, which includes a high percentage of the adults between the ages of 18 and 49 that most advertisers seek to reach. **********The show has also proved to be television's best lead-in in decades to local news on affiliated stations, and it helped rebuild NBC's ''Tonight'' into television's dominant late-night franchise. **********Don Ohlmeyer, the president of NBC's West Coast entertainment division, said NBC had factored all those things into its bid to retain ''E.R.,'' although he added that NBC was confident ''we won't lose money'' on the deal, even without considering those ancillary benefits. **********Still, the per-episode price of $13 million towers over anything previously paid for the rights to broadcast a television series. **********Most series cost networks between $1 million and $1.5 million. ''E.R'' itself now costs about $2 million. This season NBC agreed to paid a then-record $5.5 million an episode for ''Seinfeld.'' **********But the star of that series, Jerry Seinfeld, announced last month that he was shutting down production on the comedy in May. That only increased the pressure on NBC to keep possession of its other ratings leader, ''E.R.'' **********Mr. Ohlmeyer acknowledged that the imminent loss of ''Seinfeld'' helped force more millions out of the NBC treasury. **********''Obviously the loss of 'Seinfeld' increased the importance of making sure we kept 'E.R.,' '' he said. **********Robert Daly, the chairman of Warner Brothers Inc., agreed that the timing of Mr. Seinfeld's decision ''certainly didn't hurt our negotiations.'' **********Indeed, NBC acted rather swiftly to lock up ''E.R.'' as its Thursday night anchor at 10 P.M., Eastern standard time, after it learned it would no longer have ''Seinfeld'' as its 9 P.M. centerpiece. Mr. Ohlmeyer said the ''E.R.'' deal was ''basically concluded'' even before NBC entered the final phases of its National Football League negotiations, during which it lost the rights to the American Football Conference games, which it had held for more than 30 years. **********NBC was long aware that its competitors had publicly stated their intention to bid for ''E.R.'' and Mr. Daly acknowledged that while Warner Brothers could not negotiate with any other party, ''Everybody talked to us.'' **********NBC's exclusive negotiation period was not set to begin until February, but Mr. Daly said he received a call from Mr. Ohlmeyer soon after the holidays seeking to initiate the ''E.R'' discussions. **********''The whole process only took four or five days,'' Mr. Daly said. ''NBC made a very fair offer that we felt reflected the show's market value.'' **********That market value is enormous. One senior executive from a competing network said NBC had made about $200 million a year in profit on the series. **********Mr. Daly noted that NBC had reaped these enormous profits during the first four years of ''E.R.'' when it held an exclusive contract for the show and did not have to increase the license fee it paid to Warner Brothers, which is a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. **********''It was time for that to change,'' Mr. Daly said. **********Warner Brothers had actually made an effort to change the terms in the show's second year. Several current and former Warner Brothers executives said the studio had asked NBC, which is owned by General Electric, to increase the license fee to $4 million a year in exchange for a two-year extension on the initial four-year contract. When NBC declined, the executives said, Warner executives were upset and refused subsequent NBC efforts to extend the ''E.R'' deal before it reached the crisis point this year. **********Mr. Ohlmeyer noted that Warner Brothers had sought to open up the ''E.R'' deal at the same time it was looking for better terms for its comedy ''Friends.'' **********''We accepted the proposal on 'Friends' and not on 'E.R','' Mr. Ohlmeyer said. **********Mr. Daly said that Warner Brothers had preferred all along to keep the show at NBC, where it has thrived on Thursday night, and where Warner Brothers has placed several other shows including ''Friends'' and ''Veronica's Closet.'' **********''E.R.'' will remain on Thursday at 10 P.M. and will include all members of the current cast, at least for next season. After that, George Clooney is free to leave, but a Warner Brothers spokeswoman said the rest of the show's ensemble cast was under contract for two to four more years. **********With ''Seinfeld'' which is also under the Warner Brothers banner, the studio controls four of the five shows now on NBC's powerhouse Thursday night lineup. **********''We really have good relationships at NBC,'' Mr. Daly said. The studio already had commitments from NBC to put at least two other Warner Brothers shows on its schedule next fall. **********One prominent Hollywood business executive said the most likely impact of the deal was heightened pressure on the networks to own everything they put on the air. **********He added, ''I think you might hear NBC executives say: 'We had to pay for ''Frasier,'' for ''Seinfeld'' and we got it stuck to us by ''E.R.'' Never again.' '' **********One outcome may be much longer initial deals for series, the executive said, or perpetual options to insure that a series could not be offered to an outside network. **********Trying to put the scale of the ''E.R.'' deal and the N.F.L. deals in context, one senior network executive said, ''We're in a period of great desperation in television.'' **********But Mr. Ohlmeyer argued that the ''E.R'' deal, big as it was, was chiefly a reflection of how the television economy has traditionally worked, with a studio waiting for an initial four-year license period with a network to run out so that it can seek huge increases for renewals of hit shows. **********''If you look at the history of television,'' he said, ''When you have an enormous hit the network benefits for the first four years it's on the air. After that, the studio takes advantage. There's no real difference here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/03/news/imf-and-world-bank-wrestle-with-panic-and-the-future-shoring-up-the.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Friedman", "pub_date": "1998-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2298, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IMF and World Bank Wrestle With Panic and the Future : Shoring Up The World's Shaky Financial Pillars", "print_headline": "IMF and World Bank Wrestle With Panic and the Future : Shoring Up The World's Shaky Financial Pillars", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON\u2014                     It is very hard for policymakers to think clearly about the long term at a time of crisis, let alone to take on the monumental challenge of repairing and remaking two of the most important pillars of the global economy. **********Yet, this is precisely the dilemma facing top financial officials from the 175 members of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank system, along with their colleagues from the wealthy Group of Seven nations. **********The finance ministers participating in the annual World Bank/IMF meetings here, probably the most pivotal in the 53-year history of these institutions, are trying to plan for the future as turmoil and panic afflicts world stock markets, and as the global economy heads for either a dramatic slowdown or a recession. **********President Bill Clinton's call Friday for urgent steps at the G-7 and IMF level demonstrated the degree of concern about the escalating world financial crisis and the risk of recession. But even if the G-7 and IMF gatherings do produce a major initiative here, few financial experts expect a quick fix of the global financial architecture anytime soon. **********\"Strengthening the banking and supervisory systems of many countries will take a long while,\" a senior American official said. \"I don't see any way to avoid a multiyear workout, and it's going to be meaner, deeper and longer than anyone realizes.\" **********The obstacles to a quick fix are multiple: **********Japan in recent days has experienced the $16 billion bankruptcy of a leasing company, with fears that one or more sizable bank crashes could be just around the corner. Most economists agree that Japan will not be an engine of growth for Asia or the rest of the world until 2000. **********In the United States, Europe and Asia, meanwhile, controversy \u2014 and fear \u2014 continues to swirl around the $3.5 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital Management, the gigantic hedge fund, arranged at the behest of the Federal Reserve. LTCM leveraged itself with banks until its potential exposure reached a staggering level, estimated at more than $100 billion. The list of blue-chip banks with exposure to LTCM is spreading, as are write-offs at banks around the world. **********The destruction of wealth on Wall Street, not only for big-money interests, but also for the average investor, has been mirrored by market turmoil in Europe and Asia, and a quarter percentage point cut in interest rates by the Fed this week failed to stop the sell-off. The IMF and World Bank are urgently prescribing more interest rate cuts around the world to counter the economic slowdown, but even so a global credit crunch threatens to strangle both confidence and the real economy. **********Like a tidal wave whose course is unpredictable, the crisis that began 14 months ago in Southeast Asia \u2014 and contributed to the political and economic implosion of Russia in August \u2014 is now threatening Latin America, in particular Brazil, the continent's biggest economy. **********The human cost has been high, as millions of people have been thrown out of work in the hardest hit countries of Asia, where some economies have plunged into depression. The IMF estimated this week that the loss in terms of world output for 1998 would amount to $600 billion to $800 billion, equivalent to the loss of the entire economy of Canada for a year. **********It is against this backdrop that the World Bank and IMF are straining, and governments are scrambling, both to come up with a short-term economic fix and to set in motion a medium-term overhaul of the two institutions along with a new set of rules to reinforce the global financial system. **********The IMF is running low on funds and is facing, in the eyes of friends and critics alike, a serious threat to its credibility. The World Bank, in the view of its own president, is troubled by the creeping subversion of its role and risks having its mission as a project-oriented poverty fighter and adviser on financial reform being altered to that of another emergency financial fireman, or \"junior IMF.\" Yet President Bill Clinton's initiative would further alter the World Bank's role in this direction. **********Perhaps the clearest message emerging from the meetings here is this: When the rhetoric about creating a new \"financial architecture\" for the 21st century is stripped away, the reality is that reform will come neither easily nor rapidly. **********A handful of finance ministers, central bankers and international officials interviewed for this article agreed that the process of reshaping the IMF and World Bank will take years not months, and will probably continue into the early years of the next century. These officials, speaking on condition they not be named, agreed that the challenge is enormous not merely because it is hard to effect change at a time of financial crisis, but also for these reasons: **********In a global economy where roughly $1 trillion in capital flows at the speed of electronic transfers each day, and where financial markets and investors often act with a herd instinct, effective regulation has become impossible for individual countries and a daunting challenge even if the world's major economies can agree on joining forces. **********Divergent and conflicting views of how to reshape the global financial system \u2014 between Europe and the United States, between Asia and the West, between emerging market economies and the established order, between bureaucrats and politicians \u2014 have restricted consensus on anything but the most basic policy concepts, such as the need for greater transparency, stronger oversight and supervision, and requiring business to accept greater responsibility. **********The leaders of the world's three most powerful economies \u2014 the United States, Japan and Germany \u2014 are to a certain degree handicapped by domestic concerns, be they a sexual scandal that is distracting the White House, a deflationary spiral and paralyzed political class in Japan or a generational and ideological shift that has swept in with elections in Germany, Europe's biggest economy. In addition, the Continent is distracted by preparations for its new single currency. **********Regulating a global financial system in which hedge funds can leverage themselves geometrically and with little supervision, and in which money flows are instantaneous and electronic is, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin put it, \"exceedingly complicated.\" **********Mr. Rubin has noted that \"over the last 30 years, global capital flows have increased exponentially,\" and he underscored the market's \"herd mentality\" by saying that just as capital once flowed into emerging market economies without due regard for proper risk analysis, \"it is now too often flowing out in a nondiscriminatory, overly negative reaction.\" **********As the G-7 and the so-called G-22, which includes 15 developing countries, try to come up with the recipe for strengthening the financial system, they must also try to find a way to attract capital back to emerging markets. **********\"Not since the Lord parted the Red Sea has liquidity dried up so quickly in the developing nations,\" said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Hormats, like many financial officials, said it would be years before reform could be put in place, and he recalled that \"in the United States it took us five years to deal with our savings and loan crisis.\" **********Even as reform is being discussed, the IMF is under fire for having misjudged the extent of the crisis, for having misunderstood the dangers in Russia, for having been too severe in its austerity programs and for having lacked an understanding of the political and social risks associated with its programs. **********\"The IMF is guilty of hubris,\" said one of its sternest critics, a U.S. official who asked not to be identified. **********And an international financial official said: \"We need a more participatory system, not a dirigiste system where the IMF comes in like an inspector-general and says, 'You have to balance your budget, get fiscal and monetary disciple and do it all by tomorrow.' The Fund is a sort of an elitist central banking unit, and what is emerging is that you can't do it all so quickly, you can't simply impose it.\" **********The IMF experience, this official said, has shown \"that if you impose something on Indonesia, they take to the streets, and if you impose it on Russia, they toss the government out.\" **********Michel Camdessus, the Fund's managing director, is facing calls for more transparency from the G-7, and yet is denying that the IMF made any serious mistakes. The Clinton administration, which contains both boosters and detractors of the Fund, appears wedded to working through the IMF on a reshaping of the global financial system. **********Differences in outlook among the G-7 itself means that the annual meetings here may produce some quick confidence-building measures, but a more sweeping overhaul of the IMF and World Bank may have to take a back seat to calls for more transparency, more private sector burden-sharing and more rules to allow banking and financial supervisors to track capital flows."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/08/business/worldbusiness/IHT-thinking-aheadcommentary-lafontaines-dangerous.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "1998-12-08", "snippet": "Political power does wonders for self-esteem.

Two years ago, Oskar Lafontaine came to Washington as an apparently fading star of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, his anxious body language radiating insecurity. **********Last week he was back exuding confidence as his country's new economic and financial supremo, arguably one of the most powerful men in Europe. His transformation, however, is not necessarily good news for everyone else. **********In his few weeks in office, he has alienated German business with ill-conceived plans to increase corporate tax burdens and raised questions over who really runs the country, he or the weak-looking Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. **********By energetically pursuing old-fashioned socialist economic remedies, Mr. Lafontaine has undercut Mr. Schroeder's pre-election pledge to forge a pro-business \"new center\" in German politics, based loosely on the \"New Labour\" policies of the British prime minister, Tony Blair. **********As if to drive home the point, Mr. Lafontaine has upset Mr. Blair's government with calls for tax standardization throughout the European Union, to raise taxes in Britain and other countries closer to high German levels, and by challenging Britain's unquestioned right under EU procedures to veto his proposals. **********More generally, Mr. Lafontaine has aroused fears both in Europe and in the United States that the old unreconstructed European left is back in charge \u2014 aided and abetted, in Germany at least, by dangerously woolly-minded environmentalists. **********The question all this raises is whether Germany's European and American partners are right to be afraid \u2014 or will Mr. Lafontaine's bark turn out to be worse than his bite? **********Recently, Mr. Lafontaine has somewhat muffled his bark. He has complained, too often to be totally convincing, that his pronouncements have been twisted to exaggerate his more extreme views and eliminate the balancing elements. **********In Washington, he went out of his way to sound reasonable. He played down his proposal for target zones for international exchange rates, especially for the dollar and euro, and said he was not proposing much more than an extension of the kind of stabilization achieved between the Deutsche mark and dollar since the mid-1980s. **********He insisted that, appearances to the contrary, he supports the independence of the new European Central Bank, which will set interest rates in the 11 countries introducing the euro from Jan. 1. And he promised there was no risk that Germany would breach the European Union's stability pact by running a budget deficit higher than 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. **********Above all, he said that his proposals to bolster demand through monetary, wage and possibly fiscal measures were only part of a policy mix that would also include supply-side structural reforms, for example by improving Germany's social security system. **********It may be that Mr. Lafontaine is toning down his bark because he is discovering that his bite is not going to be as sharp as he thought \u2014 just as the French Socialists did after unexpectedly taking power last year. **********As Mark Howdle of Salomon Smith Barney in London pointed out, European developments over the past 20 years, including the EU single market, free capital flows, the stability pact and economic and monetary union, have progressively limited the scope for governments to adopt leftist policies. **********It seems, however, that Mr. Lafontaine's aim is to circumvent that hurdle by establishing his policies at a European level, now that 11 of the 15 EU governments are broadly of the center-left. **********The odds are he will fail.

You can, in the form of some wildly esoteric securities that track the outcome of three billion-dollar suits. **********Moreover, an award is expected next spring from the United States Court of Claims in Washington in one of the suits, which was filed against the Federal Government by the Golden State Bancorp, a savings and loan. So some analysts are rating the suit's related security -- generically known as a litigation participation certificate -- as a buy. **********Such certificates, listed by Nasdaq, grew from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980's, when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was encouraging healthy savings and loans to buy ailing ones. The board created an accounting device that allowed the buyer to list the liabilities of the acquired institution as ''supervisory goodwill.'' This could be written off over 35 to 40 years, and during that time, the write-off would be accounted for as capital, against which loans could be made. **********In 1989, however, Congress dissolved the bank board and phased out the supervisory goodwill. The savings institutions contended that this move violated their agreements with the Government. **********More than 120 breach of contract suits have been filed against the Government by savings institutions seeking restitution and damages. The lawsuits could ultimately cost taxpayers $30 billion. **********Because pending suits were likely to complicate mergers in the rapidly consolidating savings-and-loan industry, three institutions -- Golden State, California Federal Bank and Coast Federal, created special securities to spin off the potential value of their suits to shareholders. **********Coast Federal has been acquired by Washington Mutual; California Federal is acquiring Golden State but is keeping the latter's name. The three institutions have all received summary judgments in their favor at trial court level. They are the only thrifts to have spun off such securities, which trade separately. **********Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst at Jeffries & Company, said the Golden State certificates are the blue chips of the group because an award is so close, though the Government is likely to appeal any damages. **********Golden State, which calls its certificates litigation tracking warrants, is the only company that will pay off in stock, making the payout nontaxable until the shares are sold. The warrants closed at $4.875 on Friday. Ms. Chamberlain says they could pay off at $11 each if Golden State gets the full $1.9 billion it seeks. **********Coast Federal issued what it calls contingent payment rights, which pay off in cash. They closed on Friday at $9.50. The claims court, however, has urged Coast and the Government to reach a settlement. Barring that, hearings on damages are not likely to begin until 2000, diminishing the present value of the security, said David Dusenbury, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Coast is seeking $1.1 billion. Mr. Dusenbury puts the pretax cash value at $24.40 a certificate if a full award were made today. **********California Federal's case has not advanced as far as the others. It has two certificate classes: contingent litigation recovery participation interests and secondary contingent litigation recovery participation interests, which will pay off differently depending on the amount of any award. They trade at $16.125 and $17.75, respectively, and Ms. Chamberlain said they could pay off at $48.60 and $70.89 if the institution gets the $1.64 billion it seeks. **********The wait has tired many investors, and the securities are trading well below their highs.

Albright's address today to the National Press Club, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: **********The past year has been the most disappointing since the Oslo accords were signed in 1993. It was 16 months ago that active U.S. mediation helped to produce an agreement on Hebron. Since then, a crisis of confidence has arisen between Israelis and Palestinians that has stalled progress at the bargaining table and put at risk both historic accomplishments and future hopes. **********In only two years we have gone from a situation where Israel had some form of peace negotiation, relationship or promising contact with every Arab state except Iraq and Libya to a stalemate which has eroded regional cooperation on issues such as water, economic integration, the environment and refugees; stalled Arab-Israeli contacts,  and caused optimism to be replaced by a sense of fatalism and helplessness about the future. **********At the root of the stalemate is a crisis of partnership between Israelis and Palestinians wherein short-term tactical considerations have too often trumped broader understandings of common interest and cooperation. Indeed, we have gone from a situation where no problem was too big to solve to a situation where every issue is argued about. **********We have seen tragic incidents of terror, unilateral actions and provocative rhetoric undermine the historic accomplishments of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. **********For more than a year now the United States has been working hard to revive the missing spirit of partnership. We've been trying literally to restore the ability of the parties to talk constructively with each other, to overcome mistrust, to solve problems, to arrive at agreements and to implement obligations. **********Early last year we were approached by Prime Minister Netanyahu with an idea for reorienting the process. He argued that the confidence-building period provided for under the Oslo accords had begun instead to destroy confidence. And he was right. **********The Prime Minister argued that it therefore made sense to move directly into final status negotiations and to do so on an accelerated timetable. He asked President Clinton to help achieve this purpose. And as Israel's ally and friend, the President decided to try to do so. . . . **********During this period, there was some narrowing in the differences between the parties. But very substantial gaps remained. **********Despite our efforts we could not get the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to an accord. Both urged us nevertheless to persist and to help them find a way to bridge their differences. **********By early this year we had come to the conclusion that even if the parties could not be responsive to each other's ideas, they might respond to ours. Working closely and quietly with both sides, we began to share our views on how the parties might resolve their differences over the four-part agenda. **********In January here in Washington, President Clinton met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat, and I met with them when I traveled to the region in February and then again in Europe in March.  Ambassador Ross and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been in almost constant contact.  Throughout, we continued to urge the parties to sort out the issues directly with each. Unfortunately none of these discussions produced sufficient results. It was clear that tough decisions were required if Israelis and Palestinians were to reach an agreement that neither side was prepared to make. **********Having worked since January to share our thoughts informally with the parties at the highest level, it was logical that we should at some point share a more fully integrated set of ideas in an effort to facilitate decisions. We took this step not because we wanted to, but because there seemed no other way to break the dangerous logjam that had developed. **********Our ideas stem from intensive consultations with both sides and take into account both the obligations each side has accepted and the vital interests each must protect. **********They are balanced, flexible, practical and reasonable. They are based on the principle of reciprocity, another concept stressed by Prime Minister Netanyahu and embraced by us, because of our belief that parallel implementation of each side's obligation is the only way to restore the partnership between Israelis and Palestinians. **********In presenting our ideas, we made it clear that we were offering them as suggestions, not as an ultimatum or an effort to impose a settlement.  Both parties have their own decision-making processes and interests, which we respect. Our purpose was only in response to the parties' request to help them find the way forward. **********. . . **********We're not giving any ultimatums, and we're not threatening any country's security. We're not trying to make any party suffer at the expense of another. All we're trying to do is find the path to peace, as the parties have repeatedly urged us to do. **********And what we have especially been trying to do in the recent weeks is to issue a wakeup call. **********The leaders of the region have reached a crossroads. Act before it's too late. Decide before the peace process collapses, and understand that in a neighborhood as tough as the Middle East there is no security from hard choices and no lasting security without hard choices. **********The parties must understand, as well, that there is urgency to this task, for time is no longer an ally of this process. It has become an adversary. **********The historic accomplishments that flowed from the Oslo process represent a strategic opportunity for peace that is now being put at risk. . . . **********For the peoples of the region who have suffered too long the path out the wilderness is uphill, but clearly marked. **********The time has come now before the dusk obscures the guideposts to move up that road, and by so doing, to answer the too-long-denied prayers of the children, all the children of the Middle East. **********Thank you very much."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/23/business/company-news-kroll-o-gara-to-purchase-laboratory-specialists.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-10-23", "snippet": "Kroll-O'Gara Co to acquire Laboratory Specialists of America Inc for $29 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KROLL-O'GARA TO PURCHASE LABORATORY SPECIALISTS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; KROLL-O'GARA TO PURCHASE LABORATORY SPECIALISTS", "body_text": " **********The Kroll-O'Gara Company, an international corporate security company, agreed yesterday to buy Laboratory Specialists of America Inc. for $29 million, or $5 a share, in stock.

In his high-pitched, raspy voice, the words sounded as otherworldly as they were inflammatory. **********''We must continue on our path to holy war,'' he said, at this rally marking the 11th anniversary of the Hamas movement, which has waged a deadly war of terror against Israel. ''We celebrate today the uprising that confronted the Israeli occupation with stones, with Molotov cocktails and with guns, uniting our people, the sons of Palestine, the sons of Jerusalem, the sons of our homeland.'' **********After the American-brokered Wye River agreement between Israel and the Palestinians was signed in late October, Sheik Yassin was locked in his house by the Palestinian Authority. His telephone lines were cut and his daily parade of visitors was shut out. **********When the authority lifted his house arrest on Dec. 24, the Israeli Government was quick to condemn what officials described as a Palestinian retreat from the promise to crack down on terrorism. **********''Why do you want to interview me?'' Sheik Yassin asked in his distinctive voice, smiling as if at an inside joke. ''To show the world a first-class example of the famous revolving door?'' **********He may appear otherworldly, but he is as engaged as any Middle Eastern politician in the terms of debate. He was referring to the Israeli coinage for what they see as the circulation of terrorists through Palestinian jails. **********The Palestinians said they had released the sheik, a very popular figure in much of the Gaza Strip, as a gesture of good will at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. **********But Sheik Yassin agreed with the Israelis that the move had probably been made in direct response to an Israeli suspension of further withdrawals from the West Bank required by the Wye accord. **********''I am a card that they play,'' he said, referring to the Palestinian leadership. **********Seated in his brother's humble home in Gaza, Sheik Yassin, who is paralyzed, nearly blind and very hard of hearing, laughed with the relatives and acolytes who surrounded him -- and ribbed him -- during an interview. **********Several times he motioned with his head for the conversation to stop because airplanes overhead, audible to no one else, were interfering with reception on his hearing aid. **********''We could use you for radar,'' his brother joked, then grew serious. ''We do use you for radar, really.'' **********Fifteen months ago the Israelis released Sheik Yassin from their jails in exchange for the release from Jordanian prison of two agents of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, who had botched an attempt to assassinate a Hamas leader in Jordan. **********Since then, Sheik Yassin has proved a nettlesome presence to the Palestinians. That is partly because he preaches against the peace effort and assists, even if indirectly, in bringing terror attacks. But it is also because he holds as much sway over poor Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Authority -- if not more. **********Indeed, at the rally today, Mr. Yassin's words were received as if from an oracle by a worshipful crowd in the Shati camp -- a Hamas stronghold that Hillary Rodham Clinton visited 11 days earlier during President Clinton's ill-fated peacemaking mission. **********''He is a super-leader, larger than life,'' said Rawda Jamal, who held her swaddled baby up to see the frail cleric. ''It was a disaster that the Palestinian Authority put him under house arrest after all those years in Israeli prisons.'' **********During his house arrest, Sheik Yassin said, the satellite atop his modest home in the shabby Zeitun section of Gaza linked him to the world. He watched Mr. Clinton's visit to Gaza on television, he said, dismayed to see the American President presiding over a meeting of the Palestine National Council in which it revoked from its charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction. **********''It was a sad spectacle,'' Sheik Yassin said, ''to see my fellow Palestinians applauding and chanting while they were deleting part of our history and their charter. That's why our rallies took place in protest: because they were turning their back on our common purpose.'' **********Describing the two months of his house arrest, he again smiled his inward smile, while a son gently eased the sheik's swollen feet into fleece-lined boots. Because Sheik Yassin's physical therapists were not allowed to visit during that time, the son -- one of his 11 children -- trained at a local hospital to nurse his father and to exercise his lifeless limbs. **********''I was happy,'' Sheik Yassin said. ''It was excellent. I had time to worship, to read the Koran. I was able to finish reading three doctoral dissertations about the holy war. I had some time to see my wife and children. Reasonable people cannot look on ill fortune as ill fortune. I prefer to see the glass as half full.'' **********Still, he said of the detention: ''I was not happy that this order came from my brothers. If it had come from the Jews, it would have been natural.'' **********The house arrest followed a suicide bomb attack on a school bus filled with Jewish settlers' children in Gaza. The children escaped harm, but two Israeli soldiers, who drove their jeep between the bomber's car and the bus, were killed, along with the bomber. **********At the rally, one speaker thundered, ''Clinton is a Jew!'' Schoolchildren read poems extolling holy war. **********A group of young teen-age boys, who sounded like an Islamic Menudo, sang to the feedback of bad amplifiers. Iraqi flags were waved, but in deference to the conditions in their rally permit, no Israeli or American flags were burned and no weapons fired. **********In his speech, Sheik Yassin condemned the Palestinian Authority without naming it or Mr. Arafat. Directing his anger into the two orange microphones held in his face, he called it corrupt and spoke out against its attempt to stifle the Palestinian news media and what he called its concessions to the Israelis and the Americans. **********As he talked into a chill wind that swirled the sand, his bodyguard kept the sheik's white head covering from flapping forward and covering his face. **********Face to face, Sheik Yassin transmits an eerie kind of serenity, uttering harsh words as gently as if he were talking to a small child. The contrast between tone and substance can be chilling. **********''We extended our hand to the world to help us get back our land, and nobody cared,'' the sheik said. ''Don't you think it's reasonable, then, for us, to carry an ax on our shoulders and make demands?'' **********Asked if that meant that Hamas, which committed no attacks during the sheik's house arrest, would strike again soon, he answered indirectly and with one of the many metaphors he employs. ''As you have seen and will see, for every action there is a reaction,'' he said. ''Our Palestinian people are like gold. The more you pressure them, the more they shine.'' **********The men around him nodded, and some stomachs grumbled, as it was shortly before the day's fast for Ramadan was to be broken with a plate of dates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/world/in-mexico-rival-parties-pass-accord-on-bank-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Preston", "pub_date": "1998-12-13", "snippet": "Mexican Government and the opposition National Action Party (PAN) vote to reform a $61 billion bank bailout that has become an example of favoritism in high places toward the wealthy; PAN settles for language in the bill that puts some pressure on...", "word_count": 752, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Mexico, Rival Parties Pass Accord On Bank Aid", "print_headline": "In Mexico, Rival Parties Pass Accord On Bank Aid", "body_text": " **********After nine months of debate that strained Mexico's maturing democracy and threatened to destabilize the financial system, the Government and a major opposition party have reached full agreement on reorganizing a $61 billion bank bailout that had become an example of spectacular corruption favoring the wealthy. **********The bailout discussion utterly dominated Mexican politics this year, becoming the first opportunity for opposition parties voted into new positions of power in 1997 to question the Government's past economic performance, force it to admit errors and change its ways. **********The National Action Party, or PAN, a conservative opposition group, decided to accept an 11th-hour resolution with the Government to signal to Mexican bankers, debtors and international investors that the opposition will not push partisan politics at the expense of the nation's financial well-being. **********The opposition party reached the bailout deal late Friday with the Government's party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The proposal was immediately voted out of a congressional committee and is expected to be approved by the lower house of the Congress later today. Approval by the Senate is pro forma because the PRI holds a majority there. **********In the end, it was the delegates from the National Action Party who blinked in a standoff -- which had stalled the discussions for weeks -- over the resignation of Guillermo Ortiz as head of the central bank. The party's leaders were insisting that Mr. Ortiz leave because they argued that he had violated the Mexican Constitution when, as Finance Minister, he cobbled together the first bailout program in 1995. **********The National Action Party lawmakers settled for language in the bill that puts some pressure on Mr. Ortiz to resign in coming months but does not require him to do so right away. Mr. Ortiz is a close ally of President Ernesto Zedillo, and the Government staunchly refused to consider letting him go now. **********The complex legislation sets up a new agency that will absorb about $36 billion of the debts carried by the current bailout program, known as the Bank Fund for Savings Protection. Unlike the fund, the new agency will be able to issue fully guaranteed bonds for trading on international markets to raise capital. Banks will be required to pay higher quotas to the new agency to help with interest and administrative costs. **********The entire portfolio of the fund is being scrutinized by international auditors. Loans found to be fraudulent will be returned to the banks. **********The package also includes a program that will cost about $4 billion over five years of new assistance for mortgage holders and other debtors who were wiped out when interest rates soared over 100 percent during the 1995 economic meltdown. **********Although the Government blundered badly at the outset of the debate, it came out surprisingly well. **********Finance Minister Angel Gurria failed to anticipate the explosive issues behind the bailout and thought he would easily persuade Congress to transform the billions of liabilities on the bank fund's books into public debt. His proposal in March initiated the accusations by the opposition that the Government had used the banks and the bailout to shore up its corrupt cronies and finance the 1994 campaign of President Zedillo. **********But the Government stuck to technical arguments while the interest costs of the bailout continued to multiply. Meanwhile damaging rifts opened between the National Action Party and the other main opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, which accused the National Action Party of catering to the Government. The Party of the Democratic Revolution will vote against the bailout reform. **********The Party of the Democratic Revolution took out full-page ads in major Mexican newspapers in recent days denouncing the Government and the National Action Party as ''traitors'' to Mexican wage-earners. **********The formula that saved Mr. Ortiz has to do with the board of seven members that will govern the new agency, to be opened in March 1999. **********One seat will go to the head of the central bank, but the bill specifically bars Mr. Ortiz from occupying it because of his role in the original bailout. Another official, Eduardo Fernandez Garcia, the head of the National Banking Commission, is also barred. **********The agency can function with the two seats empty, but PAN deputies argued that the situation will grow increasingly uncomfortable for Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Fernandez and will eventually force them out. **********Several Government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed with that prognosis. They said that the bruising debate had done critical damage to Mr. Ortiz's political standing, although not to his reputation as a financial manager."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/01/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-215694.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-12-01", "snippet": "Tom Lantz is named to new position of executive vice president for sales at Relationship Marketing Group (S).", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Tom Lantz was named to the new position of executive vice president for sales at Relationship Marketing Group, Fairfield, Conn.

But according to a new report issued by the Kobren Insight Group, a lot more of them ought to be slamming their doors. **********Kobren Insight, an investment management firm in Wellesley Hills, Mass., lists 11 funds that for various reasons it said should be closed to new investors. **********The reasons cited in the report run the gamut from over-diversification to an inability to maneuver quickly. What's surprising is the number of high-performance, high-profile funds that make the list, among them Janus, Vanguard Windsor II, Fidelity Equity-Income and Mutual Discovery. **********''Our research suggests that many funds have grown very large, and their size may begin to have an impact on their performance,'' said Edward R. Goldfarb, portfolio strategist for Kobren Insight. **********''None of these are panic sells, but shareholders would benefit from sponsors closing the fund and focusing on maximizing the return on existing assets,'' he said. **********Fund companies are often loath to close even those funds that have swollen asset bases because the fees they receive are figured as a percentage of assets under management. The larger the fund, the bigger the fund company's pay check. **********Indeed, not one fund company plans to close a fund named on Kobren Insight's list. And despite their size, some of these funds are still performing well. In fact, several are rated ''strong buys'' in Kobren Insight's investment newsletters, the firm's highest rating. **********One such fund is Fidelity Equity-Income. It held $24.8 billion in assets as of May 31, but its performance remains strong and Kobren Insight rates it a ''strong buy.'' **********But given a good alternative, Mr. Goldfarb said, Kobren Insight will always recommend a smaller fund over one of the behemoths. Mr. Goldfarb, for instance, favors Warburg Pincus Growth and Income for investors looking for a solid growth and income offering. **********Warburg Pincus holds less than $1 billion, which gives manager Brian S. Posner, who used to manage Fidelity Equity-Income II, opportunities that the Fidelity fund is just too large to grab, Mr. Goldfarb said. The strategies are similar, although the Warburg fund is slightly more value oriented than the Fidelity fund, he added. **********KOBREN INSIGHT rates these five funds as ''holds'', even though it said they would benefit from closing: Twentieth Century Ultra, Janus, Kaufmann Fund, PBHG Growth and Acorn. **********Mr. Goldfarb said investors should not scramble to buy shares if these funds announce they will close to new investors. He added that there's no point in dumping shares, either, if you hold them in a taxable account and have large unrealized gains. **********Twentieth Century Ultra uses an earnings momentum strategy that often requires the fund to trade quickly in response to earnings disappointments or rejiggered forecasts. At $26 billion, it may soon be too large to move nimbly, Mr. Goldfarb said. **********Gunnar Hughes, a spokesman for American Century, which runs Twentieth Century Ultra, said the fund has more good investment ideas now than the money to buy them, and has experienced no liquidity problems. **********The $22 billion Janus fund is not only a giant in its own right, it also owns many of the same stocks as other Janus funds. In the aggregate, then, Janus managers may have trouble moving large blocks of stock without affecting market prices, Mr. Goldfarb said. **********Moreover, the $14 billion Janus Worldwide is still accepting new investments, while Janus Overseas was closed at just $4.3 billion earlier this year. At the time, Helen Young Hayes, who runs both funds, said she was concerned that significant cash coming into the Overseas fund would make her job more difficult. Why not close the larger fund, too, Mr. Goldfarb asked. **********A Janus spokeswoman responded that Worldwide can own United States stocks as well as foreign stocks, and that makes it easier for Ms. Hayes to maneuver. **********It is especially important for small-cap stock funds to keep their asset bases small, according to Mr. Goldfarb. When these funds expand, they often tend to start buying mid-cap stocks. **********They also begin to move more sluggishly, handicapped by their larger size. Kaufmann is a clear example, said Mr. Goldfarb: its performance has suffered as assets rose to today's $6.4 billion. A fund official declined  to comment. **********The $4.1 billion Acorn fund also owns much larger stocks than it used to, although its manager, Ralph Wanger, blames that on the appreciation of the stock market, which he says has gotten ''stupidly overpriced.'' **********At the $5.3 billion PBHG Growth fund, liquidity is a concern, because the fund needs to be able to move quickly to execute a strategy driven by earnings momentum, Mr. Goldfarb said. Gary Pilgrim, the manager, said liquidity is less of a problem at lower-turnover funds like his. **********THE $4.3 billion Mutual Discovery fund has moved to mid-cap names in the United States, and its size will lessen its ability to buy the smaller European stocks that had bolstered its performance, Mr. Goldfarb says. **********Robert Friedman, a manager of the fund,  conceded that Discovery has moved into mid-cap stocks, but noted that these tend to be less volatile. He also said that managers have more clout with such companies, and so can pressure them into making shareholder-friendly moves. **********Finally, sheer size reduces a fund's ability to benefit shareholders by buying mid-cap and smaller-cap stocks, especially when funds balloon to $20 billion or more, Mr. Goldfarb said. **********Funds in this position include the $26.6 billion Vanguard Windsor II and Fidelity's $18.7 billion Equity-Income II fund, which Mr. Goldfarb nonetheless rates as buys because of their strong managers. But he advised investors to select smaller alternatives, if available. **********A Vanguard spokesman noted that Windsor II is run by four different managers who trade independently, adding flexibility that other large funds may lack. A Fidelity spokesman said the company would close its funds if it were in the best interest of shareholders. **********T. Rowe Price International Stock fund's $10.6 billion in assets have forced it to own a large number of stocks, and lose flexibility, according to Mr. Goldfarb. But Steve Norwitz, a Price spokesman, said size is not an issue because the fund owns large companies and is diversified internationally."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/12/business/company-news-greater-bay-bancorp-acquires-pacific-rim-bancorp.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-05-12", "snippet": "Greater Bay Bancorp acquires Pacific Rim Bancorp for $30.9 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GREATER BAY BANCORP ACQUIRES PACIFIC RIM BANCORP", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GREATER BAY BANCORP ACQUIRES PACIFIC RIM BANCORP", "body_text": " **********Greater Bay Bancorp said yesterday that it had acquired Pacific Rim Bancorp, the holding company for San Francisco's Golden Gate Bank, for $30.9 million in stock.

As of Friday, they had fallen 21.5 percent. **********Although the benchmark Brazilian stock index shot up 6.19 percent today, at least some of that buying was attributed to market gains elsewhere. The underlying sense in Brazil is that more irrational selling is in store. **********''I see it as unbridled pessimism, which has no foundation,'' said Rodrigo Fiaes, chief of equity research at Banco Icatu here. ''When the market was on the upswing, people were not discounting negatives. Now the market is only discounting the negatives, and not taking positive developments into account.'' **********Yet the urge to dump shares of Brazilian companies was not completely unwarranted, and some analysts considered it a correction of excessive confidence. Since the I.M.F. bailout was announced, there have been some signs that the Brazilian Congress may not be as quick, or as pliant, in accepting the economic belt-tightening proposals of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration as investors had hoped. **********Congress rejected a proposal to make retired civil servants pay into the pension system, and it went home for the holidays without approving the Government's revised 1999 budget, or extending and increasing a special financial-transactions tax that officials are counting on to meet revenue targets promised to the I.M.F. **********''It's a razor-edge situation,'' said Edmar Bacha, executive director of BBA Securities in New York. ''Because the price is not as low as indicating default, nor as high as indicating that Brazil is over the hump, there's a tremendous uncertainty right now as to which way Brazil is going to go. Is it Russia or Korea?'' **********In addition to the generally falling stock prices, trading volume has plunged, with daily trades toward the end of last week totaling $225 million in value -- one-third of what they were before the global financial crisis began. With such low liquidity, the stock exchange has become a kind of fun-house mirror, magnifying small movements of capital at price extremes. **********At the end of 1997, about 30 percent of the trading was done by foreigners. By now, most foreign investors have fled. **********''The market is leaving aside the fundamentals, and reacting strongly to any news related to Congress, or to the austerity package,'' said Roque Sut Ribeiro of the Marka Nikko Asset Fund here. **********Brazil's dollar reserves, now at $49 billion after it received a first installment of nearly $10 billion I.M.F. aid in recent days, are still in decline. As of the end of last week, $2.64 billion had flowed from foreign reserves. **********If trading takes place among a smaller number of investors these days, the number of companies they are trading is also minuscule, compared with those traded on stock exchanges in the United States. Brazil's main index, the Bovespa in Sao Paulo, is made up of a handful of blue-chip companies, including Telebras, Petrobras and Eletrobras. **********Investors will be watching for new appointments that President Cardoso is expected to make on Wednesday. He is expected to create some new jobs in his Cabinet, including a civilian Minister of Defense and, later, a Minister of Production who would wield considerable power. **********But the most important announcements for markets this week will involve appointments to head Petrobras; a savings institution, the Caixa Economica Federal, the Banco do Brasil and the National Bank for Development. **********One name that has been mentioned to head the development bank is Maria Silvia Marques, the chief executive of CSN, the national steel company. Her appointment would be taken as a sign by investors that privatization would continue to be a Government priority. **********''If Cardoso can get it right, in the sense of sending a positive signal to the market,'' Mr. Fiaes said, ''and if the market will be satisfied with the options, we'll see a general improvement in sentiment toward Brazil.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/08/business/company-news-profit-recovery-in-cash-and-stock-deal-for-loder-drew.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-07-08", "snippet": "Profit Recovery Group International will acquire Loder, Drew & Associates for $70 million in cash plus 803,535 restricted shares; at current prices, stock consideration would be worth about $24.8 million (S)", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROFIT RECOVERY IN CASH AND STOCK DEAL FOR LODER, DREW", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PROFIT RECOVERY IN CASH AND STOCK DEAL FOR LODER, DREW", "body_text": " **********Profit Recovery Group International said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the privately held Loder, Drew & Associates for $70 million in cash plus 803,535 restricted shares.

He and his wife, Patricia, were artists in postwar Manhattan, living in a railroad apartment on the Upper West Side, when they acquired a roll of vinyl sheeting. Noticing how the vinyl stuck to the apartment's semigloss walls, they put it, along with some scissors, in the bathroom. Friends would spend hours playing Matisse, cutting out designs and sticking them to walls. **********A game, and a family business, were born. In 1951, Mr. Kislevitz created Colorforms, nothing more than laminated paperboard and stick-on vinyl shapes. He ran the company out of the family's new home, in River Edge, N.J.; the factory where the pieces were cut and boxed was just a few miles away, in Ramsey. **********Colorforms became a staple of simple play. Even as the toy industry veered increasingly toward more complex and costly items, Colorforms held its own, its logo a distinctive and familiar presence in stores. **********But consolidation has turned the once-genial toy business into a much higher-stakes game dominated by Mattel and Hasbro, whose combined sales of $8 billion in 1997 represent more than one-third of the entire industry's.

In late January, Toy Biz wound up selling Colorforms for $5.4 million to University Games, a privately held maker of board games in Burlingame, Calif. **********''What we see in Colorforms is the opportunity to create a preschool brand to compete head-on with Mattel's Fisher-Price and Hasbro's Playskool,'' said Robert Moog, chief executive of University Games. **********Mr. Moog, who hired Joshua, 40, and David, 41, to help manage the brand, wants to restore the luster Colorforms enjoyed in its early years. **********The company was an innovator in marketing and advertising, seeing the profit potential in licensing cartoon characters and producing versions of them in Colorforms. **********''Harry was aggressive with character licensing -- Popeye was his first license -- and he produced great, long commercials that feel today like mini TV shows,'' Joshua Kislevitz said. **********Licenses held by Colorforms today include Disney's Winnie-the-Pooh and Mattel's Barbie. The core line of about 70 varieties of stick-on sets sell for $4.99 to $9.99; depending on the complexity of the sets and factoring in licensing fees, they cost $1.50 to $6 to make. **********Toy Biz was lured by Colorforms' licensing business, and the Kislevitz family hoped its linkup with Toy Biz would provide advertising budgets and greater heft with retailers. **********But the time under Toy Biz was uncomfortable. Uncertain of their role, Joshua Kislevitz joked, he and David were ''vice presidents of nothing.'' Distribution faltered and the marketing push never materialized. Sales remained flat, and a sense of corporate drift was hard to shake. **********University Games was waiting on the sidelines. Mr. Moog had bid for Colorforms, losing out to Toy Biz. But that did not stop him from inquiring four months after the sale whether Colorforms was in play. **********Toy Biz would not discuss Colorforms beyond a statement released at the time of the sale. In it, Joseph Ahearn, the chief executive, said: ''Recent consolidation in the toy industry has resulted in fewer licensing opportunities for Colorforms products than we expected. The sale of this division would allow us to continue to focus on our core business and on our proposed acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Group.'' **********University Games plans to smooth Colorforms' distribution problems in the next 12 months -- an intention that is drawing praise from retailers. ''We had awful, awful distribution when they were by themselves,'' Alison Weinberger, the preschool activity buyer for Toys ''R'' Us, said. ''But University Games is a good vendor; we're very pleased about this.'' **********House-brand sets now constitute about 30 percent of the Colorforms line, while those featuring licensed characters make up the balance. Mr. Kislevitz and Mr. Moog would like to reverse that ratio; that way, the brand itself sells. **********And University Games is planning television commercials in 1999 and new products to extend the Colorforms brand to an array of educational toys and games. **********SO far, Colorforms has mostly sat out the digital revolution. In 1994, the Kislevitzes licensed the Gryphon Software Corporation to manufacture Colorforms computer graphics games. But Mr. Moog said that collaboration with Gryphon, now owned by the Cendant Corporation, had fizzled by the time he came on the scene. **********''There is a lot of interest, especially, in using the Colorforms brand in new media,'' Mr. Moog said, adding that he was still exploring high-technology options. **********Meanwhile, two new licenses this year -- for the Nickelodeon show ''Blue's Clues'' and a Dreamworks SKG children's film, ''Small Soldiers,'' which is scheduled for a summer release -- hold promise. **********Mr. Jacobson of Jefferies & Company said Colorforms had the potential to surpass $20 million in annual sales. ''First and foremost, Colorforms needs advertising support,'' he said. ''Another license like Barbie, which does really well for them, wouldn't hurt, and neither would some modernization.'' **********Ira Mayer, publisher of The Licensing Letter, a trade publication that tracks licensing deals, said Colorforms still owned a potent weapon -- ''the ability to appeal to multiple generations.'' **********He added: ''Licensing or no licensing, the play value is there. A toy like that will come back.'' **********Golden Oldies, Going Solo **********COLORFORMS is not the only classic in the toy universe that is feeling the tug of potential buyers. **********It is not even the only one that has been pursued by University Games, which has made a practice of rooting through the industry's dusty back shelves in search of possible acquisitions. A favorite on the company's wish list is Slinky, made by James Industries of Hollidaysburg, Pa. **********''I get a lot of calls from Bob Moog,'' said Betty James, the co-founder of the company, referring to University Games' chief executive. James Industries has held on -- and even enjoyed a surge in sales thanks to the Slinky Dog featured in ''Toy Story,'' Disney's hit children's movie. But Ms. James, 81, cannot imagine keeping the business much longer. **********Another classic going it alone is Etch A Sketch, made by the Ohio Art Company of Bryan, Ohio. The downside to owning a classic, said William C. Killgallon, 59, the second-generation chairman of the company, is that while everyone is familiar with the brand, everyone also thinks he knows what it should cost. **********Mr. Killgallon has had a hard time raising the price of the original Etch A Sketch, which for years has sold for about $10. He has brought new life to the product line and to the balance sheet through spinoffs like Zooper Sounds Etch A Sketch, which retails at twice the price. **********The voracious Mattel and Hasbro may be interested in the company, Mr. Killgallon said. **********''We're on their radar,'' he said. But he intends to keep Ohio Art independent, offsetting the ebb and flow of the toy business with revenues from a division that makes film canisters for Eastman Kodak and ashtrays for General Motors.

After all, there are plenty of ordinary people plying their wares and interests there. What happens instead when the Internet thinks about itself and tries to imagine its place in the world? Can one trust the Internet's sense of proportion and purpose? Or, when it comes to the Internet, do its advocates and participants see anything clearly? **********The evidence has not been overly encouraging. And during the last two weeks, a group of high-profile, youngish Internet advocates began to say as much. The group decided that views of technology and the Internet had been skewed toward extremes. On the one hand, the Internet is treated as the electronic frontier, the hope of humankind, the harbinger of a coming utopia. **********On the other hand, this high-technology nexus has seemed to be a home for pornography and perversion populated by sexual predators, a fitting example of the evils and dangers of unfettered technology. **********In response to these views, the dissidents wrote a manifesto calling for ''techno-realism'' and calling themselves techno-realists. This manifesto -- instantly given its own World Wide Web site at www.technorealism.org -- rejects the ''louder voices at the extremes'' in favor of a more balanced consensus, a ''fertile middle ground between techno-utopianism and neo-Luddism.'' **********The eight principles of techno-realism generally seem as if they should be obvious to anyone. ''The Internet is revolutionary,'' the writers declare, ''but not utopian.'' It is, they say, a communications tool that will not bring paradise. ''The thrill of acquiring or distributing information quickly,'' they add, should not be confused with wisdom. Freedom is important, but some government intervention is necessary. Wiring schools to the Internet will not save the schools, but can augment education. **********This middle ground seems both commonsensical and very nearly trite. Who could object? And judging from the manifesto's signers, who has? Its supporters range from commentators like Steven Johnson, the editor of Feed (www.feedmag.com), to hip-hop Internet advocates like Douglas Rushkoff, a self-described youth-culture enthusiast who likes to ''poke holes in the system'' and has always seemed a bit of a techno-utopian himself. **********It is supported by David Shenk, the author of ''Data Smog'' and a techno-skeptic, as well as by Mark Stahlman, a founder of the New York New Media Association, who more than a year ago wrote an intriguing critical analysis of the utopian ideology of Wired magazine for the 'zine Rewired (www.rewired.com/96/Fall/ 1118.html). Even Kevin Kelly, one of the cyber-gurus behind Wired, has joined the ranks of supporters. **********But the triteness appears only when viewed through the scrim of real life. On the Internet, this mild-mannered declaration is being treated like a truly revolutionary document, with signatures still accumulating http://www.technorealism.org/list-html). **********Techno-realism has inspired flames and counterflames at forums run by Feed (http://www.feedmag.com/html/dialog/98.03dialog/intro.html) and even more hostile commentary on the Well. Sarcasm and insider allusions are the rule at another site that mocks the manifesto and its signers (www.technorealist.org): ''SEE The TECHNOREALISTS Go Against The Wired LIBERTARIANS'' as they ''FIGHT For The Digital FUTURE!'' **********The techno-realism ''movement,'' barely a week old, even inspired a conference at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at the Harvard Law School on Thursday (http://cyber.harvard.edu/technorealism.html). At the conference, techno-realism was called ''a more nuanced and useful way to think'' about technology. **********But it is only in the slightly neurotic world of the Internet and its insider commentators that this kind of statement would cause this kind of controversy or inspire such hyperbolic advocacy. Outside the Internet, most of its points seem obvious or facile. In the Feed-sponsored dialogue on techno-realism, David Hudson, a founder of Rewired, points out that taking the techno-realist middle ground is a ''bit like establishing a political party for those who breathe air or put their pants on one leg at a time.'' **********There seems to be a fun-house quality to the fuss, as if the manifesto writers were pointing out that perhaps the emperor was not wearing pants at all, not realizing that neither were they. The statement is opposed to the distortions of the Internet's utopian thinkers, but its promotion and style can seem right at home. Wired magazine bears its utopian message with neon colors and high-concept color ads that seem custom designed for the Internet set; it gains stature with its links to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab through Nicholas Negroponte. **********Techno-realism preaches humility but has been just as earnestly promoted and pumped up, sprouting links on the Web and finding a Harvard connection in one of its creators, Andrew L. Shapiro, a fellow of the Berkman Center and a contributing editor at The Nation. In both cases, too little is carefully analyzed; too much depends on appearing to be progressive and ahead of the curve. **********But in a conversation, Mr. Shapiro noted out that the techno-realist statement was just a first step, one needed for attention. He argued that the kind of support now being given to techno-realism might be a sign that ''Internet thinking is coming of age.'' He suggested that the ''laissez-faire extremism'' of Internet utopianism might be coming to an end with a new kind of ''political maturity.'' **********In the meantime, the fact that techno-realism is being considered a revolutionary step is a sign of how undeveloped and off kilter most Internet thinking is."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/22/business/economic-scene-salmon-eaters-salute-a-victory-against-the-protectionists.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1998-01-22", "snippet": "Peter Passell Economic Scene column says price of salmon in market is lower because of successful efforts of lobbies for wholesale fish distributors and restaurants in America to beat back efforts by domestic salmon industry to use nation's trade ...", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Salmon eaters salute a victory against the protectionists.", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Salmon eaters salute a victory against the protectionists.", "body_text": " **********THANKS to hard-charging Chilean exporters, fresh salmon -- in particular, the bone-free fillets ready for the broiler -- has become a major bargain. Check that: much of the thanks must go to lobbies for wholesale fish distributors and restaurants here in America. **********For at considerable cost they have beaten back efforts by the domestic salmon industry to use the nation's trade laws to bar the foreign competition. Indeed, optimists in the free-trade crowd see a glimmer of hope that consumers will more routinely benefit from organized resistance to laws designed for protectionists. ''We may be witnessing the emergence of an anti-anti-dumping coalition,'' suggested Greg Rushford, editor of The Rushford Report, a Washngton-based newsletter. **********With the world's supplies of ''free range'' salmon badly depleted by overfishing, large-scale commercial salmon farming in tidal pools has come of age. Salmon are raised in, among other places, Norway, Scotland and America. But Chile is the market leader owing to a combination of ideal water conditions, low-cost labor and entrepreneurs quick to incorporate both new technology and modern advertising. Chilean exports to the United States skyrocketed from nearly nothing in the late 1980's to 70 million pounds in 1996 -- almost half the market for farmed salmon. **********Not surprisingly, prices have fallen sharply, which accounts for the presence of salmon fillets in more supermarkets and on far more menus in midpriced restaurants. And while the domestic salmon industry, based in Maine and Washington, has remained profitable, it would be more profitable without all that low-cost Chilean fish flooding the market. So last year a coalition of eight American salmon farmers with a total of 440 employees hired Michael Coursey, the Washington-based lawyer who succeeded in knocking Norwegian salmon out of the market in 1990 by charging the Norwegians with selling below cost. **********In light of the dreary history of both subsidy and dumping -- or selling below cost -- cases over the last two decades, it seemed the Chileans and those who enjoy their fish didn't have a prayer. ''The trade laws are written to protect domestic producers,'' reminds Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ''Consumers' interests don't figure in the equation.'' **********In fact, those $5.95-a-pound supermarket specials on salmon fillets are likely to be around a while longer. The subsidy charge has effectively been rejected and the preliminary anti-dumping duties assessed by the Commerce Department average just 5 percent -- a far cry from the 42 percent asked by the plaintiffs, and not nearly enough to send the Chileans packing. **********It's possible that the Commerce Department simply overcame its loathing for everything imported and judged the Chilean case on the merits. But if you believe that, you might want to invest in Princess Di commemorative ceramics before the factory runs out of clay. **********A more plausible explanation is that importers fought back with weapons that work. Atlas Air Inc., a cargo shipper that handles millions of pounds of Chilean salmon, hired Bob Dole's lobbying firm to make the case for importing tasty fish at reasonable prices. An alliance of importers in South Florida commissioned an economic consulting firm that came up with the preposterous (but eye-catching) estimate that 19,000 American jobs -- including 3,600 in Florida -- depended on easy Chilean access to the salmon market. And the National Restaurant Association weighed in with a shove at Congress and the Clinton Administration. **********In a better world, Mr. Litan argues, there would be virtually no laws specifically aimed at regulating imports. The consumer-oriented antitrust laws, which prohibit restraint of trade and outlaw sales below cost with the intent of bankrupting competitors, would apply to foreign companies the way they now apply to domestic ones. **********But foreigners don't vote in Congressional elections, and their efforts to buy favor with campaign contributions the way their American counterparts do is widely seen as a no-no. By the same token, large American exporters, who after World War II stood as a bulwark against protectionism, have lost their enthusiasm for open trade now that they have lost their commanding lead in technology. Many -- including Kodak and Boeing -- play both sides of the protectionist fence. And not surprisingly, ''the Commerce Department views corporations that compete with imports as its real constituency,'' argued Ronald Cass, dean of the Boston University School of Law. **********Hence from Mr. Cass's perspective, the best hope for consumers is a convergence of interest with businesses that depend on imports. To date, very few companies, with the notable exception of Caterpillar Industries, which lobbies hard for access to imported steel, have put in the political effort. But the success of the Salmon Trade Alliance (http://www.salmontrade.com) may just prove to be catching."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/business/the-markets-bonds-bond-prices-surge-as-investors-push-yields-to-31-year-low.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1998-10-06", "snippet": "Bond prices surge for biggest one-day gain in more than year as investors worldwide seek relative safety of Treasury securities for fifth consecutive day; yields on Treasury's 30-year bond plummet to 4.72 percent, from 4.84 percent, lowest for lon...", "word_count": 836, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Prices Surge as Investors Push Yields to 31-Year Low", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: BONDS; Bond Prices Surge as Investors Push Yields to 31-Year Low", "body_text": " **********Another big loss in stocks and fears of a further deterioration in nearly all types of financial assets drove investors worldwide into the relative safety of Treasury securities yesterday for the fifth consecutive day.

''I don't know where the end of this process lies.'' **********Further deterioration in world stock markets yesterday only reinforced the demand for Treasury securities.

Most stock markets overseas also slumped. **********Analysts said there was disappointment that finance ministers and central bankers attending the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had apparently failed to agree on a plan to shore up the faltering international economy. **********''Many went into the weekend thinking a credit package for Brazil would be in the works and announced just after the elections, which were held on Sunday,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president and chief money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Inc. **********Mr. Sullivan said the recent steep slides in interest rates ''are divorced from underlying economic and credit market fundamentals'' in the United States. Instead, he said, ''they are based upon a whole different attribute: a heightened preference for quality, safety and liquidity.'' **********The severity of the challenge facing policy makers and market participants alike was underscored yesterday by William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********Answering questions at a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers in Washington, Mr. McDonough said the current crisis was the most serious since World War II, adding that the declines in world markets and economies could ''get worse because there is a significant possibility of a credit crunch.'' **********''But the people in this room have the capacity to make sure this doesn't happen,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''It makes sense to control the risk aversion of 'let's batten down the hatches and protect our institution.' If every institution does that, I can assure you we will have a very large credit crunch.'' **********The collapse in the price of riskier fixed-income assets relative to Treasury securities claimed another victim yesterday, as Criimi Mae Inc., a real estate investment trust with a big portfolio of commercial mortgage securities, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following big losses on its investments. **********''As all of these markets have blown up, the value of Criimi Mae's assets plummeted,'' said Jim Callahan, executive director of the Pentalpha Group, an investment advisory firm based in Greenwich, Conn. **********Still, Mr. Callahan said: ''a lot of people are breathing a sigh of relief at what Criimi has done. Filing for reorganization is a better outcome than a fire sale liquidation, like Long-Term Capital.'' **********Traders said Long-Term Capital Management, the formerly high-flying hedge fund that was salvaged from near-collapse late last month by a consortium of investment banking firms, was in the market yesterday selling mortgage-backed securities and older Treasury securities, and buying freshly issued Government notes and bonds. **********The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was not the only maturity that registered big price gains yesterday. **********Near the close of trading in New York, the 4.5 percent two-year notes were quoted at a price of 100 29/32 , up one-quarter of a point, to yield 4.02 percent. The price of the 5.25 percent five-year notes rose by 17/32 , to 105 5/8, to yield 3.96 percent.

But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov and still regards a well-written letter as a labor of love is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. **********The Post Office is broke. **********In 60 of the country's 89 state-like regions, more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with up to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills -- about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. **********Air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office coughed up five million rubles for old bills. A second airport is still demanding three million rubles for past-due debts. **********So much mail is backed up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck. Delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind. **********''The situation is really extraordinary,'' said Vladimir V. Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the Government's Communications Committee. ''We've never had anything like this before.'' **********Maybe the Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in Russia. **********Until today, the lower house of Parliament was preparing to sue the Government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic crisis. **********Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them.  The oldest of the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny. **********Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, is everywhere. But oddly, real signs of public distress are not all that common, perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a postal system. **********If America's Postal Service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the Russian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation. Russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote regions get their news through the mail. **********Millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. And in the last few years, the Post Office has become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalogue items not readily available outside big cities. **********Exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute. What is clear is that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian venture, private and public alike: nobody pays his bills. **********The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not. The Government has decreed nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing. **********Among the biggest deadbeats are the ''power ministries'' -- the military and interior departments -- which did not pay during Soviet times and feel little need to pay now. **********''It's a psychology formed during the socialist period,'' said Tatiana L. Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, ''and the same situation exists with the Post Office. We've been in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand their differences. But we can't carry cargo for free.'' **********No kidding, says the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles by Government agencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs are outstripping revenues. Moreover, the Post Office is also required by the Government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, at reduced rates. **********Officials at the state Communications Department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business. **********''Here's competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, and I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by this competition,'' Mr. Sherekhov said. ''They blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail.'' **********The Railway Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such ''commercial cargoes'' are indeed a problem, but only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already gotten cash to transport the packages. The railroads are still waiting for their share of that money, she said. **********In the meantime, the situation has come to a boil. In late September, the railroads cut mail service in and out of Moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city. **********Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were awaiting service at one yard.

But as the only girl in her small village to get a secondary education, she seized an offer of free teacher training in return for a promise to come back home and open Bhumlairi's first school -- a project conceived and planned by parents, most of whom are poor farmers tired of waiting for a Government school. **********In neighboring Afghanistan, where the militantly Islamic Taliban Government has barred education to females, nearly a hundred girls flock every day to a mud-walled farmhouse compound in rural Laghman province. There, several women teachers have set up an alternative school with community help and money from a private Swedish aid group. **********In some of the world's poorest nations, villagers who are themselves often illiterate yet who understand that their children need an education to succeed in life are beginning to make schooling a community effort and a priority for spending what small amounts of money they are able to pool. **********Surprisingly, these efforts are not very popular with large organizations actively involved in third-world development. Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, told disappointed mothers and teachers in Afghanistan who had been hoping for more help with their home schools that providing education was the responsibility of government. Her view is widely shared at the World Bank and in many government aid agencies. **********''The U.N. position is not that there is something inherently wrong with home schools,'' Ms. Bellamy said in Kabul. ''But if formal education is not supplied by government, a child's right to schooling is violated. Home schools are not a substitute for formal education.'' **********A mother in the Afghan city of Jalalabad, hearing this explanation again later, said, ''But isn't a home school better than nothing?'' **********Ravi Kanbur, a former World Bank official who is now a professor of development economics at Cornell University, said these positions reflect a wider debate now about the role of government in poor countries. **********''With the collapse of the state in many countries, particularly in Africa, local organizations have taken over local services,'' he said. ''The question is, 'Is this the right way to go or not?' There is a tension between two arguments. One is that the state has made such a mess of it in the past, with money going to universities and not the primary schools. The other side says: 'Aren't you emasculating the state to do some good? Shouldn't we be building up the capacity of the state to do the right things?' '' **********Mr. Kanbur says he falls somewhere in between, as do many other development experts. **********''I think we need some kind of structured set-up, where the overall framework and the regulatory framework is set out by the state, and within that, one has the options to explore,'' he said. **********One maverick development expert who comes down increasingly on the side of small self-help projects is Mahbub ul Haq, a former Finance Minister of Pakistan and United Nations official who quit to establish a development research organization  in Islamabad,the Pakistani capital. **********In April Mr. Haq, creator of the United Nations Human Development Report, introduced a comprehensive survey of education in South Asia that was sharply critical of the record of governments in his region -- in particular India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal -- where populations have fallen behind sub-Saharan Africa in literacy rates and other measures of social development. **********Mr. Haq and his wife, Khadija Haq, a former adviser on education at Unicef and co-author of the report ''Human Development in South Asia 1998,'' conclude that in South Asia: ''Nonformal education is not the second-best option. Often it is the only option.'' **********In an interview in Islamabad, Mr. Haq said he found that in Pakistan, Government schools can cost 80 times as much to open as a simple village school, and three times as much to run. **********But most important, he said, is the way building community schools mobilizes villages, and often leads to other self-help projects. ''Successful programs meet the demands of the local community rather than the central planners,'' the Haqs wrote in their report. **********Mr. Haq said that in Bangladesh, local schools established by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a nongovernmental organization, have raised attendance rates to more than 90 percent of primary-age children in many areas in recent decades -- at a cost of only $20 per child a year, compared with $51 in government schools."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/17/business/sunbeam-posts-9-month-loss-of-587-million.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1998-12-17", "snippet": "Sunbeam Corp reports $587 million loss for first nine months of year; quarterly losses noted (M)", "word_count": 558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sunbeam Posts 9-Month Loss of $587 Million", "print_headline": "Sunbeam Posts 9-Month Loss of $587 Million", "body_text": " **********The bedeviled Sunbeam Corporation turned in yet another poor financial performance yesterday, reporting a $587 million loss for the first nine months of this year. **********While the company said the final quarter should show some improvement, it also indicated the hemorrhaging has not stopped. **********After restating its financial results in October to adjusted figures for six quarters through the first three months of this year, Sunbeam yesterday reported results for the second and third quarters, which reflected steep revenue drops and losses. **********The maker of Sunbeam and Oster brand blenders and toasters lost $344.1 million, or $3.41 a share, in the second quarter, including $213 million in primarily one-time charges.

Imagine a transmission so basic that it has only two settings, forward and reverse. **********Yes, there is such a car, and it is made in this town in western France. Amazingly, it sells for about 10 percent more than the smallest fully equipped models of Nissan, Ford or Fiat. **********What is the selling point? Simple. The car can be driven without a driver's license. Indeed, in several large European countries, like Italy and Spain, it can be driven by anyone 14 and older. For the half-dozen or so French and Italian companies that make the diminutive vehicles -- called voiturettes in France and quadricicli in Italy -- that has been enough to create a thriving market, particularly among the elderly and the very young. **********In fact, Europe's streets are so congested, and gasoline prices so high, that even licensed drivers are squeezing into these midget cars. The contrast with the United States, where drivers increasingly favor ever-bigger, ever-more-powerful vehicles, could not be more stark. Two of these tiny cars, parked end to end, could hide behind the Ford Motor Company's Expedition sport utility vehicle with room to spare. **********Voiturettes, which get about 68 miles a gallon, are probably the only automobiles, if they are in fact automobiles, with their roots in a legal loophole. French law exempts people who drive certain light vehicles from needing a license. The law was intended for motor scooters, but since it does not mention the number of wheels, enterprising French companies began building the bulbous four-wheeled runabouts two decades ago and found a ready customer base among people who for whatever reason lacked driver's licenses. **********But the manufacturers have expanded their market, two years ago banding together and lobbying successfully to have the cars legalized in much of the rest of Europe. In 1997, sales of the nine-member trade association totaled 16,000 voiturettes and are expected to rise this year to about 25,000. Top manufacturers like Microcar and Aixam, both of France, expect sales to double by 2000. **********More and more, these manufacturers are looking for buyers among professionals and homemakers who just want to get around the narrow lanes of villages from Tuscany to Touraine. **********European manufacturers of conventional small cars, like Renault in France, Volkswagen in Germany and Fiat in Italy, have poured billions of dollars into small-car development in recent years, paying little note to the voiturettes. But in October, fresh attention will focus on the market for two-seaters when Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler-Benz of Germany, becomes the first large auto maker to enter the market with a fully equipped model called the Smart Car, which it developed with SMH, the Swiss conglomerate that makes Swatches. **********The makers of conventional cars say they are not fazed. ''Our products are significantly different,'' said Luc Bastard, a spokesman for the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers in Brussels. ''They are not really competing.'' **********Others are less sure. ''This is an interesting market,'' said Nigel Griffith, head of automotive research at DRI/McGraw Hill in London, ''because very few people know about it.'' **********Several changes combined to breathe fresh life into the voiturette industry, a Lilliputian copy of the mainstream automobile business. **********In the late 1970's, public transport in the French countryside declined as the state railway cut back underused routes, prompting several French companies to try their hand at building small cars for elderly people who were stranded in the country without a driver's license. French law specified that anyone 14 and older, license or no, could drive a motorized vehicle with an engine capacity of less than 50 cubic centimeters. (The age limit has since been lifted to 16.) **********In 1981, a pleasure-boat manufacturer named Jeanneau in this village about 50 miles from the Atlantic coast decided to adapt its skills with fiberglass paneling and motors to produce a four-wheeled vehicle that it dubbed the Microcar. ''The law didn't mention the number of wheels, or anything else,'' said Dominique Mathon, the Microcar division's managing director. Two years ago, after Jeanneau was acquired by the big French yacht builder Beneteau, best known in the United States for its sleek sailboats, it joined several other voiturette makers to lobby the European Union for laws that would make any voiturette model that was approved in one European country automatically marketable in all 14 other member states. **********''This town has 12,000 people, and there's one bus a day to Nantes,'' the next largest city, said Mr. Mathon, a former Volkswagen executive. ''So from a loophole we created a product, and from the product we created new legislation.'' **********Armed with the new law, Microcar last year enlisted Italjet S.p.A., an Italian motorcycle maker, to sell its cars in Italy and Spain. At the same time, Automobiles Ligier, another French manufacturer, signed a deal with Piaggio S.p.A., the Italian company that makes Vespa scooters, to market its Ambra brand of voiturette outside France. In 1997, the first full year of sales, Piaggio sold 2,200 Ambras in Italy alone, after selling 800 in the last two months of 1996, and this year it hopes to sell more than 3,000. ''The phenomenon is growing,'' said Simone Piattelli, a Piaggio spokesman. ''We're very satisfied.'' **********Touring Microcar's factory here is akin to going through a miniature version of an auto plant. The lightweight body is formed by gluing together nine sheets of reinforced polyester. Jean-Luc Martineau, Microcar's technical director, said that to keep costs down, Microcar cannibalized conventional vehicles. Thus, the headlights and taillights come from a General Motors subcompact, the Opel Corsa; the continuously variable transmission is supplied by Bombardier of Canada, which uses it in a snowmobile. ''The design is ours, and then we modify it to fit standard parts,'' Mr. Martineau said. **********Voiturettes, with their top speed of 27 miles an hour, are not permitted on highways, so for maximum efficiency they are equipped with one-  or two-cylinder diesel engines. By law, these mini-cars cannot weigh more than 770 pounds. The Microcar, like its French and Italian competitors, is almost four feet shorter than Ford's smallest model, the Ka, which weighs about 1,900 pounds and is made and sold in Europe and South America. **********But Ford, which sold 202,000 Kas in Europe last year, its first full year of sales, says it does not fear the voiturettes. Don Hume, a spokesman for Ford Europe in Britain, when asked if he thought of them as competition, replied, ''In all honesty, no.'' Their engines are small, he said, and their use limited to city driving. And in some large countries, like Britain, they are prohibited. ''If you look at the customer profile, they're quite different,'' he said. **********Market analysts say the voiturette's real problem is price. Microcar models, for instance, sell for up to 78,000 French francs, about $13,000, more than you can pay for subcompacts like the Ka, the Renault Twingo or Fiat Cinquecento. Yet those cars, built for up to five passengers, feature five-speed transmissions and are equipped for highway driving. Many models come with air-conditioning, air bags and other safety features lacking in voiturettes. **********The cars are so costly, said Didier Joos, an analyst at DRI/McGraw Hill in London who recently studied the voiturette market, because of their reliance on expensive standard parts and small production runs. Last year, the biggest manufacturer, Aixam, turned out only about 5,800 cars. ''With this volume it is difficult to produce cheaply,'' he said. **********Moreover, he said, future legislative changes, such as requiring a driver's license, could turn the boom into a fluke. The industry estimates that about half of all voiturette owners are older than 65. **********No one expects prices to come down significantly. Mr. Mathon says the components and materials needed to keep the size and weight within the law are simply too expensive. But prices are expected to come down a bit, and there have even been hints of a price war in France recently. **********If a market for two-seaters arises in Europe, experts like Mr. Joos say, it will more likely be driven by cars like Mercedes-Benz's new Smart Car. ''One is a real car trying to be a forward-looking approach to urban mobility,'' Mr. Joos said, referring to the Smart Car. ''The other is something very much related to legislation and the social fact that some people have no access to mobility.'' **********Still, some motorists with driver's licenses are willing to pay a premium for the voiturette's minuscule size and extreme mobility in congested cities. **********''This car helps me to schedule one or two more appointments a day than my colleagues,'' said Dominique Fessart, a 50-year-old property manager in Paris who paid about $9,600 for his white Microcar Lyra. ''I can practically park wherever I want.'' **********But ''I know what a real car is,'' he added. He has a BMW for the highway. **********The safety issue has not come up much, though in some countries, like Italy, there is talk of requiring youngsters 14 and over to take driver education in school. And some manufacturers, like Microcar, offer buyers several hours of free driving lessons. (Others just hand you a booklet that says, in effect, Here's how to drive your voiturette.) **********But the voiturette makers are prepared if a discussion does arise. They argue that elderly people, their main customers, who statistically are most prone to accidents, are actually safer in a tiny car, since it is easier to drive, cannot go nearly as fast and is not allowed on highways. **********Asked whether he thought a market for voiturettes existed outside Europe, Microcar's Mr. Mathon replied that it might ''in any country where you don't need a license.'' **********Mr. Mathon said he even sold one, outfitted with an electric motor, to a buyer from the United States who had seen one in Paris and said he wanted it for use on his own property. **********Yet experts said they doubted the car's diminutive size and questionable safety would qualify it for American roads. **********''Can you believe a crash between a Dodge Ram and a voiturette?'' asked Mr. Joos of DRI."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/business/company-news-peoplesoft-shares-plunge-on-growth-warning.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-10-22", "snippet": "Peoplesoft Inc's shares plunge 23 percent after maker of business management software warns that its sales growth will plummet by half because of stronger competition (S)", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PEOPLESOFT SHARES PLUNGE ON GROWTH WARNING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PEOPLESOFT SHARES PLUNGE ON GROWTH WARNING", "body_text": " **********Peoplesoft Inc.'s shares plunged 23 percent yesterday after the No. 2 maker of business management software warned that its sales growth would plummet by half because of stronger competition.

Meriwether. He was viewed as a bond trader with a Midas touch, a mathematician of genius who found gold nuggets in markets where others saw only sand. **********In the giddy 1980's, he presided over a team of bond traders who generated immense profits for Salomon Brothers with arcane strategies that were dubbed ''rocket science.'' But in a world of sharp tongues and sharper elbows, Mr. Meriwether was softly self-possessed, inspiring confidence among equals and hero-worship among underlings. A brush with scandal, as the supervisor of a trader caught manipulating bids on Treasury securities in 1991, did little to tarnish his gleaming reputation. When he left the firm in February 1994, some of his best traders and two Nobel-laureate economists followed him into a celebrated exile in Greenwich, Conn. **********There, with fishing breaks when the bluefish were running, Mr. Meriwether and his partners operated Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a largely unregulated investment pool for the wealthy known as a hedge fund. By early 1998, Mr. Meriwether's team had invested $90 billion, most of it borrowed from Wall Street bankers so confident of Mr. Meriwether's skills that a few had even sunk some of their personal wealth into his new fund. **********And it was there, last week, that the glittering Meriwether image toppled from its Wall Street pedestal and shattered. A hastily assembled consortium of international banks and brokerage houses took possession of the faltering firm and pumped in $3.65 billion to prevent a disorderly collapse that could have panicked the credit markets and sent shock waves from small-town real estate offices to the halls of Government in Brazil. If the fund had been forced to liquidate its entire portfolio, its sales could have undermined the value of financial contracts worth as much as $1.25 trillion. **********How one man, utterly unknown beyond his rarefied world, became such a potent source of instability in one of the deepest, richest markets in the world reveals how Wall Street can be seduced by outsized success and the trappings of genius. And while the last-minute rescue grew out of an emergency warning system  that provides some comfort to the nation's financial markets, the march to the precipice reveals how little regulators, investors and even traders themselves understand the fault lines of risk buried in today's global financial landscape. **********''It is too early to give the definitive answer to what the lessons are, but clearly firms have got to look at their exposure and leverage, and at what margins of safety they have in these transactions,'' said Peter Bakstansky, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which provided the framework for the rescue. ''And they must have a better sense of the risk analysis being done by their borrowers.'' **********A top Wall Street executive briefed on the negotiations last week said he was clear about the lesson for his own firm: ''We will never let our exposure to one counterparty get to these levels again -- never. He had gotten too big for the market. Everybody gave him too much money.'' **********In a world where the concept of too much money is met with blank stares, John Meriwether was able to borrow heavily from more than a dozen financial institutions, each of which was largely unaware of how much he had borrowed from the others. Hedge funds are private partnerships that are not required to disclose their trading strategies, and that can take money only from institutions and wealthy individuals, on the theory that these sophisticated investors understand the above-average risks involved. **********Mr. Meriwether's hedge fund was even more secretive than most, to prevent rivals from copying its strategy or from anticipating its next move. In essence, the fund placed bets that tiny deviations in the traditional relationships between the prices of various securities would eventually return to normal. **********For example, the interest rate on corporate bonds is usually about one percentage point higher than on comparable Treasury bonds, reflecting the greater risk of lending to companies. If the gap, called the spread, widened to more than one percentage point, the Meriwether team  could bet with confidence that the relationship would ultimately revert to normal. Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared a Nobel prize in economics, helped program powerful computers to recognize countless similar profit opportunities. **********The profit on each of these trades was so small that the Meriwether fund had to make its money on volume. As one Solomon Brothers veteran described it, the fund was like a roulette player betting on red and doubling up its bets each time the wheel stopped on black. ''A gambler with $1,000 will probably lose,'' he said. ''A gambler with $1 billion will wind up owning the casino, because it is a mathematical certainty that red will come up eventually -- but you have to have enough chips to stay at the table until that happens.'' **********Last week's rescue, in effect, keeps Long-Term Capital at the table, buying time in which its massive gamble might yet pay off. **********One way the fund accumulated its chips was by borrowing at least $20 for each $1 in capital. **********At the end of 1997, Mr. Meriwether had so many chips that he was giving some back. Investors who had joined the fund after February 1994 were handed $2.82 for every $1 they had invested, and were told very politely to go away. Original investors from outside the firm -- who considered themselves the lucky ones -- took out their profits but kept their original stakes in the fund. After all, the fund had posted profits of 43 percent in 1995 and 41 percent in 1996. **********As a result, the fund, whose capital base started at $1.2 billion, including $100 million in general partners' money, was reduced to about $4.7 billion at the beginning of this year, from roughly $7 billion at its peak. **********Storm Warning **********An Eastern Wind Rakes Greenwich **********The first gust of the approaching storm came in June. The fund was down 10 percent, its worst monthly loss ever. Early August was even worse. As the Russian financial markets and other emerging markets grew increasingly treacherous, investors sought the safety of Treasury securities, pushing up Treasury prices while most other bond prices fell. Unfortunately, this pattern was the opposite of the Meriwether team's bets, and its paper losses grew. **********Around Aug. 15, Mr. Meriwether warned his investors and trading partners about the grim results. But with roughly $3.7 billion left in capital, the partners were still confident they could weather the storm, and many left on vacation. **********Then came Friday, Aug. 21 -- a terrible day for the bond market as skittish buyers, dumping corporate bonds to buy Treasury bonds, sent Treasury rates to a 20-year low.  Long-Term Capital's general partners rushed back to their Greenwich offices, working through the weekend and the following week to review their positions, which had dropped 40 percent that month. **********They approached new investors. But when the stock market plummeted on Aug. 31, any hope for new money evaporated. **********On Sept. 2, Mr. Meriwether invited existing investors to put in more money to help the fund stay the course. Again, there were some talks, but no cash. **********Around this time, one key element of the Wall Street warning system was activated: Mr. Meriwether's clearing broker, the Bear Stearns Companies, intensified its scrutiny of the fund's trading activities. **********Clearing brokers execute the trades of their client firms, and if one of those firms cannot deliver the cash or securities required to satisfy its obligations, the clearing broker must settle the trade with the opposite party. To reduce their own risk, such brokers require their clearing clients to keep funds on deposit as collateral, and they can limit trading. Bear Stearns did, and Long-Term Capital complied, people who were briefed on their relationship said. **********Another part of the Wall Street warning system was tripped, too. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which monitors the key commercial banks that serve the Wall Street community, was questioning how much Mr. Meriwether owed to institutions under its supervision. **********Distress Call **********A Legendary Trader Reaches Out **********On Friday, Sept. 18, what had been a deeply worrisome problem became a full-blown crisis. The triggering event is still shrouded in official silence, but several people with sideline seats say that Mr. Meriwether, the celebrated bond trader, was blindsided by an unraveling stock investment. As the prices of Ciena and Tellabs shares fell following the collapse of their merger, Long-Term Capital had to provide additional collateral to brokers who had lent it money to buy those shares. Federal regulations on such transactions leave no room to wiggle. **********In any case, the $3.7 billion in capital that Long-Term Capital had in mid-August had dwindled by more than two-thirds. It had become clear to several top Wall Street executives that Mr. Meriwether needed fresh money or his firm would fail. **********''And if this firm had to liquidate in distress, the ramifications for the global marketplace would be very negative,'' one senior Wall Street executive said. How negative? ''No one felt they could even quantify it.  That's one of the things that made it so scary.'' **********No one knew exactly the magnitude of the fund's liabilities, not even Bear Stearns, in part because the fund used complex financial contracts, known as derivatives, whose value was difficult to assess. But the yawning fear was that the nascent recovery in the market for bonds -- from mortgage-backed securities that help underwrite home purchases to the sovereign debt of Brazil -- would be ''stopped in its tracks and turn the other way'' if Long-Term Capital failed. **********Though early reports have credited the Fed with pulling together -- some say forcing -- the bailout, it seems to have begun on Sunday afternoon, when Jon S. Corzine, a senior partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, talked with Peter R. Fisher, an executive vice president of the New York Fed who was monitoring the crisis in Greenwich, and with top executives at Merrill Lynch, UBS of Switzerland and J. P. Morgan. Some of the firms had lent money to the fund, while others were trading partners or investors. **********Those calls helped knit together a group to solve the crisis: Mr. Corzine; David H. Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, and Herbert M. Allison Jr., Merrill's president; David Solo from UBS A.G. and Douglas A. Warner 3d, chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company. **********At 7:30 on Tuesday morning, the core group decided to gather on neutral ground in a private dining room that Mr. Fisher made available at the New York Fed's headquarters a few blocks from Wall Street. At the same times, teams from the investment banks were dispatched to Greenwich ''to look at the situation,'' one top-level Wall Street executive said. **********That examination made it clear that the fund would not be able to cover its obligations if it were forced to hurriedly liquidate its positions. **********At 7 p.m., sleek black limousines again converged on the Fed's headquarters. This time, the core group had invited six other banks and brokerage houses, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Travelers Group. **********While the Fed officials encouraged the group to come together, how pivotal a role the Fed played in the rescue effort is the subject of considerable disagreement among the participants in the drama. **********''The Fed just provided the forum,'' one senior Wall Street executive said. Some of the bankers, however, have complained privately that regulators were in fact pressuring them to rescue the fund. **********The negotiations were difficult, but the executives finally agreed they had no alternative but to give Mr. Meriwether more money. **********Help Arrives **********Buying Time, But at a Price **********At 10 A.M. Wednesday, senior officers of 16 banks and brokerage firms  assembled in a Fed conference room. They waited for more than a half-hour for William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Fed, who had just returned from London. At 10:40, he came in to explain that Mr. Corzine of Goldman, Sachs might have found a buyer to come to Long-Term Capital's rescue. **********''Everyone in the room knew'' that the potential buyer was the celebrated investor Warren E. Buffett, said one senior executive who was briefed on the meeting. Mr. Buffett had stepped in to rescue Salomon Brothers in 1991, after the bond trading scandal that prompted Mr. Meriwether's departure, and his involvement would have injected instant confidence into the marketplace. When Mr. McDonough suggested a recess until 1 P.M., the executives left the Fed, no doubt with their fingers crossed. **********When they returned, however, the Fed president announced that the potential buyer had balked. Mr. Komansky of Merrill Lynch then challenged the group: How much additional money would each firm contribute to keep the fund alive and forestall the crisis of confidence that its collapse could produce? **********There were angry arguments and resentful speeches, reflecting the tensions the men faced. Each executive knew that if his firm seized its collateral from Long-Term Capital and fled, only a few of them would reach the exit before the roof fell in. Nevertheless, collective action was difficult for such natural competitors, even with the Fed's brooding oversight. **********Bear Stearns insisted, successfully, that its risks as the fund's clearing broker should exempt it from further contributions. Executives from three foreign banks initially balked at contributing anything, provoking a lecture from a senior Wall Street executive. The trio huddled privately, and announced they would participate after all. **********In the end, 14 firms committed $100 million to $350 million each. That they could do so on such short notice is one happy result of the long, fat years in the capital markets that preceded these last anxious months. That the rescue effort was organized so smoothly suggests, too, that a strong habit of informal cooperation and close consultation has been forged in past crises. **********At most, the deal bought the fund  some breathing room in which their bets may, just possibly, ripen into the extraordinary profits that tempted them into this risky territory in the first place. But the cost was high. The rescue was essentially an informal, high-speed bankruptcy reorganization that turned Long-Term Capital's creditors into its new owners, who will oversee every aspect of the restructured firm's existence. **********When the rescue package was reported to Mr. Meriwether in Greenwich at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, he gathered his exhausted partners in his office and explained the deal, as he understood it. The partners in the room, and those listening by telephone in Tokyo and London, were calm as their future took an unexpected and personally painful twist. **********Honeymoons would be canceled, weddings postponed. Homes under construction might never be finished, and once-glittering reputations might be lost forever. **********At the end of the week, Mr. Meriwether and his partners retained a sliver of equity in the firm that they built on genius and panache. Their 180 employees -- most of whom had invested each year's bonuses in the fund -- were left with little more than uncertain jobs. **********But regulators and others are left pondering how a small band of traders could threaten the confidence that knits together the world's financial markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/05/world/albright-says-she-will-add-day-to-talks-on-mideast.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1998-05-05", "snippet": "US Sec of State Madeleine K Albright will spend extra day in London for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to restore momentum to peace talks; has been unable to win agreement from Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu to American p...", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Albright Says She Will Add Day to Talks On Mideast", "print_headline": "Albright Says She Will Add Day to Talks On Mideast", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright decided tonight to remain here an additional day to extend what she hopes will be decisive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders that restore momentum to the search for peace. **********Ms. Albright, in a long negotiating day, was unable to win agreement from the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to American proposals for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, parallel with specific Palestinian moves to counter terrorism. **********Ms. Albright had a second meeting, of an hour, with Mr. Netanyahu, after five hours with him earlier, but had little to say in public. **********She is to meet Mr. Netanyahu for breakfast on Tuesday morning before seeing Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. She spent 90 minutes with Mr. Arafat today. **********Mr. Arafat has accepted the American ideas in principle, and a senior Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath, said, ''Ms. Albright did not propose to us any significant alteration.'' **********Senior American officials confirmed tonight that the main stumbling block was Mr. Netanyahu and his insistence that he could not withdraw, for security reasons, from the 13 percent of the West Bank the Americans think is the minimum that Mr. Arafat can accept. **********Mr. Netanyahu has publicly said he can yield 9 percent before final status talks begin, but has privately told Mr. Clinton that he might be able to give up 11 percent. **********Mr. Netanyahu also wants firmer assurances on security from the Palestinians, and the two sides disagree about the scope and timing of a later Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, due by the end of August. **********Ms. Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, was carefully downbeat, saying this evening, after the early sessions, ''At this point we do not have compelling evidence that the meetings will yield a breakthrough.'' **********Although ''the situation is relatively unchanged,'' Mr. Rubin said, Ms. Albright ''is determined to keep at it in the course of the night, because she wants to do all she can to make the meetings in London decisive.'' **********Mr. Rubin declined to assign blame, but said: ''A failure to put the process back on track will carry with it grave risks of disillusionment and violence in the Middle East, and that is why Secretary Albright is working so hard.'' **********If the meetings fail, he said, the Americans would decide ''what next steps to take.'' Those steps could include efforts to increase pressure on Mr. Netanyahu, including a public discussion of the American proposals and a clear statement of who disagreed with them. **********Mr. Netanyahu, with the support of 81 of the 100 Senators in Washington, has urged President Clinton not to go public with proposals that they contend an elected Israeli Prime Minister cannot accept. The Americans deny that they want a confrontation  and say their proposals are intended just ''to get both parties to 'yes,' ''  one official said. **********An important part of the proposals, if accepted, would commit both Israel and the Palestinians to accelerated negotiations, which Mr. Netanyahu favors, on a final settlement. Under the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, which mandated the interim withdrawals, talks on a final settlement are supposed to continue in parallel and conclude a year from today, in May 1999. **********''Time is running out to complete the sequence laid out in Oslo,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''In the absence of that, there is a grave danger that the vacuum in the peace process will cause violence.'' **********Mr. Arafat has said he will unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in May 1999 if there is no agreement. **********Mr. Rubin warned today that given ''the extreme complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved,'' including final borders, control of water sources and a resolution of the status of Jerusalem, ''a year is not a long time to complete that process.'' **********Mr. Arafat was largely noncommittal today, saying only that little progress had been made. Mr. Netanyahu, by contrast, was typically expansive, saying he was here to try to achieve a breakthrough and urging compromise on both sides. **********''It is time to move the process forward,'' he said after meeting Ms. Albright this afternoon. **********''There is an equal willingness to move forward on the other side,'' Mr. Netanyahu said of Mr. Arafat. ''Both of us have suffered from wars and terrorism. **********''I think the Americans understand our position better. There are certain decisions which I can only take in Israel,'' with the Cabinet. **********But American officials, even privately, were pessimistic that Mr. Netanyahu would settle on a figure that Mr. Arafat could accept. Mr. Netanyahu insists that Israel maintains the right to decide how much territory to hand back. **********Mr. Rubin was circumspect. ''We're working assiduously and we're trying to be as creative as we can to bridge the gaps,'' he said.

He called the vote today ''an obvious vote of confidence in the democracies of Eastern Europe.'' **********Senator Joseph R.

And he warned, ''If we fail, historians may look back at the early post-cold-war period as a tragic loss of opportunities.'' **********The opponents to the measure represented the ideological poles on the commmittee. On the right, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri voted no because he was worried about what NATO's role might become. On the left, Senator Paul D.

Such an event, he said, would cause ''a poisoning of relations with Russia and ultranationalists coming into power.'' **********Senator Wellstone said that his father was born in pre-Soviet Ukraine and had fled before the 1917 revolution, and that his father's family was believed to have been murdered in the Stalin-era purges. **********''He was the wisest man I've ever known,'' the Senator said, ''but I think he'd be in agreement with George Kennan,'' the American diplomat and historian who said a year ago that ''expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.'' **********Senator Ashcroft, a Republican who is considering a Presidential race, questioned in today's hearing ''what the role of NATO is'' now that the collapse of the Soviet Union has removed any threat to the alliance. **********He said he worried that NATO was moving ''from a defense of territory to a defense of the interests of member countries'' anywhere in the world.

When Howard Carter unearthed the tomb of Tutankhamen in 1922, the world learned of his discovery through a spectacular scoop by The Times of London in a dispatch sent ''by runner from the Valley of the Kings.'' The paleontologist Richard E. Leakey drew widespread attention to humankind's African origins with a series of popular television documentaries. **********Runners are no longer needed to carry the latest news from the Valley of the Kings. Archeologists are turning to the Internet to announce their finds and findings, with many of their postings geared more toward the generalist than the specialist. Journal articles follow later for colleagues and the historical record. So with only a modicum of digging, the armchair archeologist can uncover a wealth of archeological sites. Web sites, that is. **********A few clicks of the mouse will transport a Web surfer to the Valley of the Kings, the great necropolis on the west bank of the Nile where archeologists are busy excavating one of the largest tombs ever found in Egypt. They are combing through what they call Tomb Five, believed to be the tomb of the many sons of Ramses II, who dominated the known world in the 13th century B.C. and, in his spare time, fathered more than a hundred children. **********Visitors to the Theban Mapping Project's Web site (www.kv5.com) can, with the aid of a plug-in or two, watch that excavation through a montage of color photographs. One by one the layers are peeled away on screen: first, discolored reddish dirt, which suggests the presence of mummified tissue to the practiced eye; 20 centimeters lower, the mummified thigh bone of a calf, which was once a prized food offering; below that,  three skulls, some with vertebrae still attached, and beneath them, a fully articulated skeleton lying amid bits of wrapping and burned fragments of wood. **********Thanks to the nature of interactive sites, the Web surfer can watch these skeletons unearthed in slow motion or at double speed or, should the desire strike, go backward to bury the bones all over again. **********Archeological Web sites are proliferating and come from all corners of the world. You can visit a dig of Mayan ruins in Belize (alishaw.sscf.ucsb.edu/ford), check out the excavation of a Maltese tomb from 2500 B.C. and see computer renderings of what it  might have looked like (www.bris.ac.uk/ Depts/Archaeology/html/research/ comvis/insite.htm) and (www.apva.org) learn about the excavation of Jamestown, Va. **********Field workers no longer have to wait as their manuscripts languish on the shelves of understaffed, underfinanced university presses. They can go on line almost instantly. Scholarly publishing and peer review can come later. More immediately, the Web connects archeologists to their far-flung colleagues (for consultation, or information on where to buy a centimeter scale or a good hieroglyphic pattern for needlework). But many sites are aimed at the general public, for education and entertainment and sometimes a little fund-raising. **********Many find the medium uniquely suited to the message. ''One of the wonderful things about the electronic media is the pace at which you can continue to change and update things,'' said Angela M. H. Schuster, an associate editor at Archaeology, the publication of the Archaeological Institute of America. ''One fragment or one glyph can suddenly readjust your entire understanding of a site. The Web allows you to revise very quickly.'' **********Archaeology magazine now has its own Web site (www.he.net/archaeol), and its editors have compiled a useful directory of favorite sites (www.he.net/archaeol/ wwwarky/wwwarky.html). Its parent organization, the Archaeological Institute of America, put its own directory of favorite sites on the Web this month, graded by appropriate audience (csaws.brynmawr.  edu:443/web2/AIAWebSites.html). **********Nigel Strudwick, an Egyptologist at the University of Cambridge, set up Egyptology Resources (www.newton.cam.ac.uk/egypt), one of the first such Web pages, in 1994. ''I was thinking of, to use a posh English term, the educated lay public,'' Dr. Strudwick said. ''Egyptologists are very bad about publicizing their work, and it is difficult to interest the media except in the most spectacular finds. Books are expensive -- 120 pounds sterling for a two-volume set with a lot of black-and-white photos and a few color plates -- and reach a small audience.'' **********Dr. Strudwick's site takes an in-depth look at his excavation of the tomb of Senneferi in Luxor. There are Quick Time Virtual Reality panoramas that place visitors in the shrine of the tomb, enabling them to examine the hieroglyphics and paintings on the walls (''My apologies for the various items of expedition equipment visible in the photographs''), a Coffins page and some very detailed explanations of how excavations are done, from digging techniques to staffing rotations to the forms that must be filled out for each artifact recovered. **********BACK in Thebes, the mapping project maintains a mixture of useful and enjoyable information on its site: timelines of 3,500 years of Egyptian dynasties, 365-degree color panoramas taken from various spots in the Valley of the Kings, the names and hieroglyphics of the known sons of Ramses II, blueprint-like plans of the tombs and pictures and biographies of the major players on the dig. **********The director of the mapping project and dig, Kent R. Weeks of the American University in Cairo, keeps Web visitors apprised of the latest developments through occasional progress reports. His letter of March 15 tells of sailing the Nile from Aswan to Abu Simbel to photograph scenes of Ramses II and his sons on the walls of temples, of the engineering problems involved in shoring up the walls of the ancient tomb to guard against collapse and, most important, the news that he and his colleagues have identified 108 chambers and corridors in the tomb so far and expect to find a total of 150. **********At its best, the sites give visitors an Indiana Jones, you-are-there sense. **********''On some walls, traces of finely carved raised relief scenes can still be seen,'' Dr. Weeks wrote.

Mr. Netanyahu responded by scheduling meetings with fundamentalist Christians and Republican leaders hostile to Mr. Clinton. **********But the idea that Mr. Clinton reportedly broached at the meetings, linking the three required Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank to a concrete list of Palestinian obligations, in effect supported Mr. Netanyahu's central insistence that any revival of the Oslo process be contingent on Palestinian fulfillment of specific conditions, ranging from adoption of a new charter to steps to combat militant organizations. **********After Mr. Netanyahu concluded his meeting and before Mr. Arafat began his, the scandal broke. Even if Mr. Clinton was not totally distracted while meeting Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader was denied the chance he had eagerly awaited to make his case public. **********On his return, Mr. Netanyahu was greeted by his right-wing coalition as a conquering hero. Even Zeev Begin, a Likud hard-liner who has been one of Mr. Netanyahu's fiercest critics, enthusiastically approved the Prime Minister's performance. ''Standing firm is the right line to take, and it will have its rewards,'' he said. **********As if to demonstrate that he had not retreated an inch, Mr. Netanyahu indirectly rejected a central Palestinian demand, that Israel cease building new settlements in the West Bank. ''The Oslo accords do not negate our rights to construct new settlements or to continue to build in the city of Jerusalem,'' he said. **********At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu denied accusations that his real goal was to kill the Oslo accords and to put the blame on the Palestinians. **********''I am not looking for Palestinian opposition in order to undermine the peace process,'' he said. ''I want a Palestinian commitment to continue with the process. We are ready, willing and able to advance, provided the Palestinians agree to hold up their end of the agreement.'' **********Mr. Arafat, by contrast, left Washington in a sour mood. ''What he is offering is peanuts,'' he said of Mr. Netanyahu. ''It cannot be accepted.'' **********Convinced that Mr. Netanyahu had no intention of continuing with the Oslo process, and lacking any real leverage, Mr. Arafat had placed high hopes on Mr. Clinton to compel Israel to return to the land-for-peace formula that both sides accepted in 1993. **********Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator who accompanied Mr. Arafat, said the Palestinian leader had warned the President that if the stalemate continued, he would step down. **********''He said that if Mr. Netanyahu continues with noncompliance, with all the security plans and settlements, I will tell my people that we failed, and resign,'' Mr. Erekat said. **********Mr. Erekat denied that Mr. Arafat's resignation threat was a response to American proposals. But Palestinian officials said it was clear that he intended to warn Mr. Clinton that unless the Americans changed Israel's stance, they would bear responsibility for any ensuing chaos. **********Many Israelis, Americans and Palestinians believe that Mr. Arafat's death or resignation could plunge the Palestinians into a bitter power struggle, with unpredictable consequences for the peace effort. **********From Washington, Mr. Arafat embarked on a tour of North Africa and Europe to try to drum up Arab and European support. But Arabic newspapers reported that he was unlikely to get more than a brief and limited summit meeting of Arab leaders. And in London, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the current chairman of the European Union, made clear that he would follow the American lead on the Arab-Israeli front. **********On his return to Gaza on Wednesday, Mr. Arafat vented his frustration when he was asked if he agreed to the proposed linked withdrawals. ''Definitely not,'' he snapped. His aides said he meant Mr. Netanyahu's proposals, not Mr. Clinton's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/03/business/company-news-beacon-capital-to-buy-14-properties-in-dallas-area.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-07-03", "snippet": "Beacon Capital Partners Inc says that it agreed to acquire 14 properties in Dallas area from Breunig Commercial Management Inc of Dallas for $91.5 million (S)", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEACON CAPITAL TO BUY 14 PROPERTIES IN DALLAS AREA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BEACON CAPITAL TO BUY 14 PROPERTIES IN DALLAS AREA", "body_text": " **********Beacon Capital Partners Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire 14 properties in the Dallas area from Breunig Commercial Management Inc. of Dallas for $91.5 million.

At a meeting of its governors Thursday, it left German lending rates unchanged, unwilling to follow the government-elect's unsolicited advice or the easing Tuesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. **********In another lurch away from Mr. Kohl's free-market policies, Mr. Lafontaine announced last week an initiative to help tame the world's unruly currency markets, which have strewn their economic wreckage this year from Brazil to Russia. **********He wants to impose trading parameters on the dollar and other currencies, creating in effect a new international financial architecture. It would be similar to the 1941 Bretton Woods agreement, which pegged the world's currencies to the dollar, with the difference that the euro would be a second anchor. **********But the same central bankers who would have to operate such a rigid system dismiss the idea as unrealistic. Echoing views heard in national central banks, the European bank president, Wim Duisenberg, this month said such currency controls were years away at best. **********\"It is not at all on the agenda for the moment,\" he said, \"and I do not expect it to come on the agenda very soon.\" **********The prospective new finance minister is raising expectations that he probably cannot fulfill, not least because the United States will never agree to a trading grid for the dollar, said Joachim Fels of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. **********\"He will not get very far,\" Mr. Fels said. **********Whether or not he gets the job of finance minister, Mr. Lafontaine already has imprinted his economic ideas on the new government. Chancellor-designate Gerhard Schroeder this week endorsed Mr. Lafontaine's ideas about currency controls, for instance. **********For now, Mr. Lafontaine has the right of first refusal on the finance portfolio, although a decision may take days or weeks. That will depend upon the progress of negotiations toward a coalition government between Mr. Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens party. **********As chairman of the Social Democrats, Mr. Lafontaine can choose his own job, party insiders say. Mr. Lafontaine could opt for the role of parliamentary faction leader. **********Although Mr. Schroeder won the election, many see Mr. Lafontaine as a sort of co-chancellor because of his uncontested control over the party, which Mr. Schroeder must consult for any big decisions. **********The traditionally left-leaning views of Mr. Lafontaine clash particularly strongly with those of the outgoing Mr. Wagiel. The latter endlessly lectured his counterparts from Washington to Paris about his creed of fiscal rectitude, austerity and free-floating currencies. **********Mr. Waigel, who watched speculators blow apart the best-laid exchange rate plans of Europe's leaders in 1992 and 1993, would never have proposed a showdown with the markets by foisting a trading grid on the dollar. Quite the contrary, Mr. Waigel spent much of his time preaching a hands-off approach to dollar markets, arguing that the only way to keep speculators at bay is to run a tight and credible budget at home. **********Critics of fixed dollar rates call them a throwback to the 1970s, noting that Bretton Woods collapsed in 1971. **********\"All experience has shown that fixed exchange rates are the start of politicized rates,\" said Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of the German Industry Federation. \"Wanted or not, it leads to a wave of worldwide protectionism.\" **********The proposal \"shows naivet\u00e9\" and \"pure nostalgia,\" he said. **********\"Stable exchange rates cannot be ordained and cannot be politically arranged,\" said Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, in reaction to Mr. Lafontaine's proposal. \"They must be earned.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/business/investing-it-mutual-funds-the-art-of-swimming-against-the-tide.html": {"writer_name": "Marcia Vickers", "pub_date": "1998-03-22", "snippet": "Question-and-answer article with Anthony M Gallea, senior portfolio manager at Smith Barney office in Rochester, NY, where he oversees $600 million in client assets; Gallea is a contrarian who studies psycholgy of possible investment; describers h...", "word_count": 1942, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Art of Swimming Against the Tide", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT/MUTUAL FUNDS; The Art of Swimming Against the Tide", "body_text": " **********''BUY when blood is in the streets.'' No one takes that  investing adage more to heart than a contrarian like Anthony M. Gallea. **********Mr. Gallea, 48, is a senior portfolio manager at the Smith Barney office in Rochester, where he oversees $600 million in client assets. He is also the co-author, with William Patalon 3d, a business reporter for The Baltimore Sun, of ''Contrarian Investing'' (Prentice Hall/New York Institute of Finance, $25). **********Here, Mr. Gallea discusses the central premise of contrarianism --  that when everyone holds a stock or sector or country in low esteem, it may be precisely the time to invest. He also explains how to pick winners,  how to limit risk in this chancy field and which investment areas he is keeping a contrarian eye on: Japan, the metals market and energy stocks, among others. **********Q. What is the contrarian philosophy? **********A. It attempts to ascertain an extreme or consensus opinion and then see if there is an argument for investing in the other direction. It's the theory that if everybody believes something and has acted on it, then the money available to push that investment in the same direction is diminished. **********Q. What's the difference between contrarian and value investing? **********A. I think that a contrarian starts with the sentiment or the psychology of the situation and then proceeds to the financials, and a value investor starts and ends with the financials.  Both try to buy assets at a discount, but I think all investors try to do that, even growth investors. **********Q. You have said that contrarians have nerves of steel. What other personality traits do they have? **********A. I'm not so sure it's nerves of steel.  It's more a willingness to think independently. For most people, it's not easy to invest in a way that is in disagreement with their friends, their seeing and reading and so on. **********Q. Can you give an example of the  extreme opinions contrarians seek? **********A. The crash in '87 is one example. The consensus opinion was that the market was in deep trouble. That turned out not to be the case. **********But right now the U.S. market isn't  saying a thing to me as a contrarian. I don't think there's extreme bullish or bearish sentiment; opinion seems equally divided. People feel that I'm bearish, as a contrarian, because there's a lot of bullishness around. But I don't sense any extreme. **********I sense more of an extreme in the Far East, in the metals market and  in Japan. Those markets may be saying something to contrarians. **********One sector that is worth watching is energy. People are becoming more bearish about energy and there's more in the papers about it that reminds me of what I used to see in the 70's. It's not there yet, but if you got some additional drop in energy prices, energy stocks would become a lot cheaper and then a contrarian might see it as a time to buy. **********Q. How do you know if there is extreme opinion against a stock? **********A. One difficulty we've had as contrarians is to quantify extreme opinion. Then we ran across a study by John Howe of the University of Kansas about stocks that are down 50 percent or more. He did an exhaustive study -- thousands of stocks over many years -- and found that stocks that had dropped 50 percent or more from their 52-week highs tended to outperform the market and those that were up 50 percent or more tended to underperform. **********That led us to the work of other academics and market people saying that this works. So, we don't consider a stock unless it's dropped at least 50 percent from its 52-week high. That's our proxy for contrarian sentiment. **********Q. Are you looking at any particular stocks right now? What about Nike? **********A. There is no stock I'm looking to buy this morning. As for Nike, I've been following it. It doesn't meet the first criterion of down 50 percent, so I wouldn't buy it. But the world is awash in sneakers. People are generally not pleased with that whole sector. They think that sneaker prices are too high. If I could buy Nike 50 percent below its highs, then, sure. **********Q. Because you still think that it's a good company. **********A. Any time you can buy a big-name blue chip or a franchise stock at 50 percent off, the odds are well in your favor. These companies have lots of resources, lots of money, lots of people. They can work out problems that small, one-product companies can't. If you look back, all of these big, big companies that have gotten into trouble -- Citicorp, I.B.M. -- make it out, by and large. **********Yet, people tend to take a piece of news, extrapolate a new worry from it, treat that as fact and extrapolate yet another worry. We take events and psychologically push them forever into the future in a straight line. We underestimate the muddle factor: that we all tend to muddle through problems eventually. **********You have a parallel situation in Japan today. You have widespread difficulties in financial companies that are well publicized. The Government seems to be ''pushing on a string'' -- do you remember that phrase from many years ago, when the Fed was dropping interest rates but couldn't get the economy moving? The market there is down more than half from its highs of several years ago. Yet it's a great industrial power; it's not going to slide into the ocean and disappear. We have $10 million invested there now. **********Q. Your secondary criterion is buying by insiders or savvy outsiders. **********A. We found a study showing that a net increase in such buying tends to forecast a higher price. So we set inside buying as additional confirmation because once you've got a stock down 50 percent, that doesn't mean it's going to go anywhere. **********Q. Can you give me some examples of insider buying? **********A. Here's one: Sunglass Hut. I should note that we do make a market in Sunglass Hut and we have a speculative rating on the stock. **********At any rate, you see them in all the malls. The stock declined from $20 to the $6-to-$7 range between July 1996 and July 1997. So it met the first screen: down at least 50 percent. **********Then we picked up in the S.E.C. filings that Sunglass Hut insiders  had bought about 100,000 shares in several transactions last summer. **********The story was pretty simple: there hadn't been any new lines of fashion sunglasses in the prior year and  there was a bit of overexpansion. But those are the kind of things you work out of. Anybody who's ever been in retail knows that you get overinventoried at times. **********So we bought the stock at $6.75 last summer and it is now at $10.50. So it hasn't had a big move yet. But that is the kind of stock that we look for. **********Q. How can you predict whether an ailing company will recover? **********A. After you find a stock trading at a 50 percent discount to its 52-week high, you do the fundamental analysis by reading an analyst's report, whatever. Then we pick four of the  fundamental ratios a value investor might look at. If we get a stock down 50 percent or more and then two of these four line up, you don't have to have insider buying. **********Of course, in looking at these four ratios, everything is not necessarily going to be pretty because a stock doesn't drop 50 percent and look beautiful. What you want to get is a sense of whether the company has got time to work it out. **********We start with a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 12. That means earnings are not highly priced. Next we look for a healthy price-to-free cash flow -- less than 10. Free cash flow is the money that's left over, after paying for basic expenses and enlarging the existing business, for creating new products, buying complementary businesses and the like. **********Then comes the price-to-sales ratio. If it is less than 1, each share is backed by a good amount of sales --  say, the share is $7 and sales per share are $10. So you've got some good numbers coming in the top line, although whether they get to the bottom or not you don't know. And then if the book value is less than 1, that tells you there are good underlying  assets: bricks, mortar and the like. **********Q. How long does it typically take for a contrarian portfolio to generate satisfactory returns? **********A. Ben Graham, the father of value investing, believed that it took approximately two years for a company to work out its problems. But in some cases, a stock just seems to go right out of the chute. **********Q. How do you limit risk? **********A. We put no more than 3 to 5 percent of a portfolio in any single stock because these companies are in some trouble. And we have a 25 percent stop-loss order -- an order to sell if the stock falls below a certain price -- because you can be wrong and there are times just to get out. **********If you find a stock with a big price decline you often are led to other stocks in the industry. So we limit ourselves to 15 percent, 20 percent, in  any industry, so we don't substitute industry risk for a stock's risk. **********As for selling, Ben Graham believed that a 50 percent profit was a good target. That dovetails with John Howe's work, that a stock up 50 percent tends to underperform. **********If you believe a sale after a 50 percent profit is premature, you can stay in and set a stop-loss order at a 30 percent profit. So if the stock goes  from 10 to 15 you're going to set a stop at 13. **********Another risk rule we have is that after three years if you don't have a 50 percent profit, you just leave. **********Those are the basic risk rules. You try to set some discipline for yourself because we're all weak. We go to cocktail parties and tell our friends about a stock we bought. Then the stock starts to drop and you find yourself defending it and then your ego is at stake. We need something to save us from ourselves. **********Q. How can average investors get into the contrarian game? **********A. If somebody has a 401(k), for instance, he may say, ''Of all my funds, what hasn't done well?'' If the Far East hasn't done well, he might say, ''Maybe I should put 5 or 10 percent of my 401(k) there.'' **********That is, just begin to take a more skeptical view and get some side investments that are going in a different direction. I'm not comfortable having all my assets moving in the same direction all the time. Maybe this is doing well for me this year, this isn't doing well for me. But next year maybe they'll flip-flop. **********Q. Why do people overreact to news and create the kind of extreme opinion that you look for? **********A. I think that's the real story about contrarian investing. People constantly look outside themselves for the answer, in the market. What is required is more introspection. I don't mean this to sound like crystals and Sigmund Freud, but we don't spend enough time analyzing ourselves. We are the filter through which all this information flows."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/01/world/war-crimes-panel-seeks-a-way-for-massacre-survivor-to-testify.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1998-10-01", "snippet": "Investigators are trying to get lone survivor of mass shooting in Kosovo out of Serbia to testify about killings at war crimes tribunal; Western diplomats say unidentified witness was among 14 ethnic Albanians who were systematically shot by Serbs...", "word_count": 1322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "War Crimes Panel Seeks a Way For Massacre Survivor to Testify", "print_headline": "War Crimes Panel Seeks a Way For Massacre Survivor to Testify", "body_text": " **********Investigators were trying today to get the lone survivor of a mass shooting in Kosovo out of Serbia to testify about the killings at a war crimes tribunal. **********The witness, about 35 years old, was among 14 ethnic Albanian men who were ordered to lie face down against a fence and were systematically shot by one or more Serbs, said Western diplomats who interviewed the man on Tuesday.

It was ''too early to say'' whether the convoys on the move were merely intended to make it ''look as though the troops were going back to barracks,'' one diplomat said. **********The survivor told diplomats that 14 men between the ages of 18 and 35 from different villages in the area had been selected for a firing line from a larger group of men. They were told to lie face down on the ground against the fence of a house, the survivor said. After shots were fired by what the survivor described as at least one Serbian policeman but possibly more, one of the Albanian men cried out that he was still alive. The man was immediately shot dead, the survivor recounted. **********The bodies were said to have been returned to their villages and buried before diplomats arrived. **********Because of the survivor, Western officials here said that the killing of the 13 Albanians provided the best case for prosecution at the war crimes tribunal, which has established jurisdiction over the Kosovo conflict. Another witness, Adem Hoxhaj, said he saw the shooting from nearby. **********By comparison, the most vivid description so far of the shooting of the Deliaj clan came from a member of the family who said he saw Serbian forces approach but did not see the actual slaughter. **********One of the diplomats said the survivor was ''an important witness'' and ''we are very concerned about getting him to The Hague. **********The issue of how to get the survivor to The Hague is developing into a test case of how the tribunal can exercise jurisdiction in Serbia, which is now the dominant part of Yugoslavia. **********Mr. Milosevic's Government has refused to recognize the authority of the tribunal and granted visas for only two investigators from The Hague. One of the investigators was scheduled to talk to the survivor today, a Western official said. **********The investigators, who are police detectives on loan to the tribunal, have no power of extradition or mandate to decide how to get the survivor who remains seriously wounded and needs medical treatment, to The Hague. The investigators were discussing with the Red Cross and Western diplomats how to proceed, the official said. **********Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, lashed out at the foreign press today for some reports of the civilian killings that mentioned the possibility that they had been committed as a reprisal for the reported deaths of Serbian police officers killed recently when their vehicle hit a land mine in the same area. **********''The policemen are mentioned now, but only in the context of speculation that Albanian civilians were killed in retaliation,'' Tanjug said. The news agency said seven police officers were killed in the incident while other reports said five died. Mines in that area, a former stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, are believed to have been planted by the separatist fighters. **********Western monitors assessing the military situation in Kosovo said there was significantly less shelling today. But shells were fired at four villages east of Suva Reka this morning, an area that had been sealed by the Serbs until today, monitors said. Columns of smoke from burning buildings were easy to see a few miles away today, and people who had fled their homes said there were Serbian policemen around their village. **********In nearby Vranici, men and women were returning to their homes after an ordeal with the Serbs. **********On Sunday morning, they heard warning shots that an attack on the village was under way, so they fled up the mountain in a caravan of vehicles. On Monday morning, the Serbian police invited them to come back, saying they would be safe. **********But when they agreed to return, the villagers said, the police took about 250 men, loaded them onto buses and took them away. The women were bused away separately, they said. Many of the women were returned to the village on Monday and others today. Late this afternoon many of the men were returned as well. They said about 50 of their number were still in Serbian custody. **********On their return this afternoon, the villagers found the bodies of two ethnic Albanian men on the ground at the mosque of Vranici. One of them, Hafir Elshani, had been shot in the chest and his nose had been cut off. The other man, Milam Bugari, had been shot at close range behind the ear. **********The villagers found that many of the vehicles in the convoy of 250 or so cars and tractors they had abandoned on Sunday had been set on fire or vandalized and their belongings had been strewn on the ground. **********Because Mr. Milosevic has been criticized by the West for allowing about 50,000 Albanian refugees to live outdoors, the operation by the Serbian police in Vranici seemed designed to create chaos and fear but also to insure that those forced to flee their homes would not end up in the forest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/18/world/light-cast-on-ties-of-insurers-to-nazis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Light Cast on Ties Of Insurers to Nazis", "print_headline": "Light Cast on Ties Of Insurers to Nazis", "body_text": " **********Newly unearthed documents suggest that German insurance companies went beyond what was previously known in conniving with the Nazis to avoid paying Jewish policyholders after the rampage through German cities in 1938 known as Kristallnacht. **********The documents indicate that the companies also sometimes exceeded Government guidelines and canceled unrelated life, health and pension policies on which Jews had been paying premiums for years. **********Article, page A9."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/business/mutual-funds-report-stocks-teeter-safe-harbor-may-be-found-corporate-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1998-07-05", "snippet": "Article on rising value of mutual funds that invest in corporate bonds (Money & Business Part 2: Mutual Funds Report) (M)", "word_count": 1010, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Stocks Teeter, a Safe Harbor May Be Found in Corporate Bonds", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; As Stocks Teeter, a Safe Harbor May Be Found in Corporate Bonds", "body_text": " **********LIKE sailors flocking to safe ports, mutual fund investors have long turned to bonds whenever stocks appear dangerously close to imploding. **********But what are the nervous to do when the safest bonds around -- benchmark Treasuries -- have soared in price? **********Concerns about Asia's fractured economic machine have caused investors -- especially those overseas -- to pull money out of certain stock and bond markets and pour it into United States Treasury bonds. So prices have risen and yields -- which move in the opposite direction of prices -- have sunk to 30-year lows. As of June 30, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was just 5.62 percent, compared with 6.78 percent one year ago. **********The safety-conscious as well as the yield-hungry investor cannot help but wonder if it's time to forage elsewhere. And if so, where? **********Funds that invest in corporate bonds, it turns out, may carry the most value now. These bonds pay a higher yield than Treasury securities because the risk of corporate default, of course, is greater than that of a default by the United States Government. The yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds is the widest it has been in five years and, given the economy's strength,  the risk of default seems limited for investment-grade bonds. With inflation low, the yields look quite nice. **********What's more, companies have issued a mountain of new debt, taking advantage of low rates to finance  capital improvements and to refinance older debt. That has left the market flooded and helped keep prices down -- a situation that, in correcting itself over time, is likely to benefit bond investors. **********The big risk is the economy. Potential buyers have been worried that corporate earnings are on the verge of a long snooze. If earnings decline, the prices of corporate bonds will fall, too, leading to lower total returns, even if dividends stay steady. **********Oversupply is also a problem in the municipal bond market, which has been second after Treasuries in investor safety. To be sure, after an uninspiring first four months of the year, munis rallied in May, as stocks stumbled and as investors snapped up the first half of the largest muni bond sale ever -- $7 billion in Long Island Power Authority bonds. Demand for these bonds, and their unusually rich yields, effectively drained money from other munis. **********The glut remains a problem, with more issues on the way. **********Still, for high-income investors looking for the best returns after taxes, municipal bonds may be the way to go. There has been a solid improvement in credit quality: Half as many issues were downgraded in 1997 as in 1996. The good news can be attributed to the booming economy and a surge in local tax revenues. **********Also, in the last year, yields on municipal bonds, relative to taxable bonds, have narrowed significantly. According to Richard J. Moynihan, head of tax-exempt fixed-income investing at the Dreyfus Corporation, the typical insured 20-year muni gives investors 91 percent of the yield of a 30-year Treasury bond, up from about 81 percent a year ago. **********For people in a 31 percent income tax bracket, ''that's roughly equal to the 7.50 percent yield they might get with a taxable security,'' he said.  ''And there aren't too many triple A-rated securities on the taxable side that return 7.50 percent.'' **********The downside, however, is that munis are less likely to appreciate, so their total return may be weak. **********FOR investors in munis, he recommends longer-term issues. ''When it comes to short-term munis -- say five-year issues -- the market is fully priced relative to Treasuries,'' he said. ''Beyond that -- going out 10 years or more -- then these bonds continue to be very  cheap relative to Treasuries.'' **********Investors who bought the longest-term issues were rewarded last quarter. The best-performing bond funds had long maturities, including the American Century-Benham Target Maturity funds, several Vanguard long-term funds and T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term. **********What about investors who are looking for even better values than corporate and muni issues, as well as potentially higher yields? Les Nanberg, the chief fixed-income officer at Massachusetts Financial Services, says the best opportunities are in high-yield junk bonds and emerging-market bonds, not surprisingly the riskiest areas of the bond world. **********He says yields on junk bonds are now 3.5 percentage points more than Treasuries, on average, while emerging-market bonds average about 6.5 percentage points more. **********After registering nifty price gains for months, junk bonds are now trading at two-year lows. Funds that invest in junk bonds posted a slight loss on average in the last quarter. **********But the news was worse for most emerging-market bond funds. On average, they lost more than 8 percent in the latest quarter, according to Morningstar. Among the bottom performers were Phoenix B Emerging Markets Bond and Merrill Lynch American Income. ''If investors can live with the volatility of these bonds, they'll be rewarded,'' Mr. Nanberg said, ''although they're clearly not for everyone.'' Anticipating more volatility, he is shying away from most of Asia but spots value in Poland, Bulgaria, and other Eastern European countries, as well as Mexico. **********What about junk bonds? Again, Mr. Nanberg is treading carefully, focusing on companies that meet at least one of three criteria: they are leaders in their industries, are benefiting from a strong economy or are benefiting from recent acquisitions. One company that he expects to benefit from the strong economy is BE Aerospace, which makes replacement parts for aircraft. **********Roger E. King, a senior portfolio manager for high-yield securities at Dreyfus, says the news on the high-yield front isn't all bad. **********''Right now, there are no panic sellers,'' Mr. King said, ''so we're in a kind of controlled downturn.'' **********That said, Mr. King advises investors to choose issues with very short maturities, to guard against changes in interest rates and the junk market's current volatility. **********Indeed, the greatest risk in bonds today may be credit risk, said John F. Poole, the head of fixed-income group at Mellon Private Asset Management. ''We don't think the economy is about to collapse,'' he added, ''but we think that individual companies may be at risk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/08/business/business-digest-277320.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 530, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Marketing Chief of G.M.

The company seems to have spent that time devising some new tactics for use in the continuing battle between long-distance and local phone companies. **********A person close to Sprint said the company was hoping to cooperate with the five Bell local telephone companies rather than attack them head-on. That cooperation could take the form of Sprint's agreeing to buy capacity on advanced local data networks that many of the Bells are planning to build. **********The Bell Atlantic Corporation, which offers phone service for much of the area from Virginia to Maine, and SBC Communications Inc. appear to be the Bells that are negotiating most seriously with Sprint, a person close to Sprint said. **********As they await permission from regulators to sell long-distance service within their traditional local telephone regions, Bell Atlantic and SBC each have already signed contracts with Sprint to buy wholesale capacity on Sprint's national fiber optic network. **********Bell Atlantic, Sprint and SBC, which includes Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell and which has agreed to acquire the Ameritech Corporation, declined to comment yesterday. **********In its announcement today, code-named Operation Fast Break, Sprint intends to unveil what it calls an ''integrated on-demand network.''  Sprint plans to say that consumers can use a single connection to the new network for multiple phone lines, access to the Internet and other advanced data services and video conferencing. **********The company plans to begin offering the new service to large business customers later this year and make it generally available to business clients around the middle of next year. Sprint plans to begin offering the service to residential consumers in late 1999. **********Sprint plans to offer the service both in areas where the company already offers local phone service as well as in new regions. **********People close to Sprint said the company had spent about $2 billion the last five years developing the new network. Among the companies that have tried the new system is Hallmark Cards Inc., the greeting card giant based in Kansas City, Mo.  Sprint is based in Westwood, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City. **********Sprint plans to announce that it has formed three strategic alliances in connection with the new system.

But that has not happened. **********MCI had an aggressive plan to build local networks and compete against the Bells, but after losses began to mount last year MCI pulled back. In fact, unexpectedly large losses in its local operation led to perhaps the most traumatic event in MCI's corporate history: its grudging renegotiation of its deal to be acquired by British Telecommunications P.L.C. last year and an unsolicited $37 billion takeover offer from Worldcom Inc., which was accepted and which is awaiting approval from regulators. **********Sprint is expected to say today that it has already spent most of the money required to build the new network.

To limit its business troubles, it must put the investigation behind it quickly without paying more in penalties than it can afford. It must also avoid being barred from Federal programs like Medicare, as a fraud conviction could require. **********But the Government has critical issues as well, such as insuring that any settlement aids the investigation of individuals in the case and sends a strong message that health care fraud will not be tolerated. **********Interviews with people who know the strategies of each side, as well as confidential documents point up these and other issues that will probably drive the negotiations -- as well as hurdles that must be overcome before a deal can be struck. These people agreed to discuss the strategic issues on condition of anonymity. **********Columbia executives disclosed last week that they expect a review of the company's business practices by outside auditors to be completed in 30 to 60 days. Even before then, people who know the company's strategy said, Columbia's lawyers are expected to approach the Government in an effort to start settlement talks, which will probably last many months. **********Simply agreeing on the allegations will take time because of the array of issues being examined. The inquiry is considering whether Columbia hospitals sought Federal reimbursement for costs that were not allowable; billed the Government for treating illnesses that were worse than patients' true conditions; included unnecessary blood tests in laboratory screenings for costs that were not allowable and struck improper financial deals with doctors. Columbia has taken no public position on the allegations, pending the outcome of the internal inquiry. **********Of course, a settlement may never be reached. Some Government officials are said to be resistant to considering a deal, while some company executives have privately expressed doubts about elements of the Government's case and concerns about the effect of a settlement on some private lawsuits filed against Columbia. But people who know each side's strategies concede that both the Government and Columbia have strong motivations to settle. **********The pressure on Columbia is financial. Its stock has lost some 30 percent of its value since the investigation became known, and concern about the inquiry has limited Columbia's ability to complete some business deals. But, more important, the company's research indicates that the investigation could affect future business. **********In November, for example, the company completed a confidential poll to determine the investigation's impact in 12 markets. The poll report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, indicated that future business could be affected. **********''Individuals who are most familiar with Columbia/HCA as a hospital system and who are aware of Columbia's involvement in the Federal investigation are significantly less likely to choose a Columbia/HCA facility,'' the poll report concluded. Among people who said they knew about the company and the investigation, the poll predicted a decline of future total market share of 8 percentage points, with markets in Florida and Kentucky showing a drop of 17 points and 33 points, respectively. **********That kind of pressure has left Columbia anxious to resolve the case and to consider paying a hefty fine if the Government's evidence is strong enough. Some Wall Street analysts said that they expected a deal to include penalties in excess of $1 billion. While declining to discuss specific numbers, people close to the company conceded that a settlement would probably be one of the largest ever involving health care fraud. **********''We understand we are dealing with significant numbers here, and the company is going in with an open mind,'' one person affiliated with Columbia said. ''But we care about the fact that this money belongs to the shareholders and that you can't just toss it out. But no one has a number they have focused on, either a ceiling or a floor.'' **********Concerning another issue important to the company, people briefed on the company strategy said that Columbia could not agree to any exclusion from Medicare, which makes up more than one-third of the company's $20 billion in revenue. That could require either negotiation of charges to sidestep laws that mandate exclusion or an agreement that any guilty plea come from a Columbia subsidiary, which could be barred from Medicare without affecting the parent company's status. **********Timing is also important to Columbia. People briefed on its strategy said that because of the financial impact of the continuing investigation, the faster any deal could be struck, the more flexible Columbia would be in accepting tougher terms. **********That could require top Justice Department officials to become directly involved in negotiations to avoid unnecessary delays. Indeed, people with knowledge of the Government's strategy said that senior officials -- including Raymond C. Fisher, the Associate Attorney General, or Eric H. Holder Jr., the Deputy Attorney General -- might become directly involved in any settlement. **********Despite Columbia's interest in talks, the Government still holds the stronger strategic position. Because of the prosecutors' power to bar Columbia from Medicare, they effectively have the trump card to leverage tough terms. Essentially, the potential of Medicare exclusion could play the same role that the threat of racketeering charges did in the Government's successful negotiation of the tough fraud settlement with Drexel Burnham Lambert in the late 1980's. **********A big issue for the Government is trust. Despite the company's professed efforts to cooperate since replacing much of its senior management in recent months, some Government officials are said to believe that Columbia's efforts have been wanting. These officials are said to believe, for example, that Columbia failed to produce some promised information, such as a systemwide accounting of total reserves established by its hospitals as part of its cost reporting to the Government. **********For the Government, another case will loom over any Columbia talks: the 1994 settlement by National Medical Enterprises to charges that it had paid kickbacks to doctors for referrals. That settlement, in which the company agreed to pay more than $370 million in penalties and plead guilty to seven charges, resulted in almost no criminal cases against individuals. In essence, the National Medical settlement has come to represent for some in the Government a case in which a corporation simply bought its way out of trouble. **********This time, people who know the Government's strategy said, prosecutors are keenly interested in insuring that a corporate plea does not spell the end of the investigation. As a result, the Government is expected to demand strict cooperation requirements from Columbia, to guarantee that the settlement could aid in future prosecutions of individuals. **********Such strict terms have been structured before, notably in the Drexel settlement. In that case, the investment house agreed to cooperate fully with the continuing investigation and to produce employees whom prosecutors wanted to interview. Drexel also agreed to pay for a Federal audit of its business, to waive attorney-client privilege in granting Government access to its files and to accept a form of administrative probation. Those terms were used to build criminal cases against a number of Drexel employees. **********While declining to discuss specifics, people close to Columbia said that the company would be willing to cooperate as part of a settlement and that many terms of such an agreement were open to negotiation. They pointed out that since most of the management team had been replaced, there was little ''emotional motivation'' for the company to object to terms that might aid in individual prosecutions. **********The Government has one other important motivator: A settlement with Columbia means more money for other health fraud prosecutions. Under new Federal laws, money from such settlements goes toward financing additional prosecutions. **********In essence, if Columbia pays a big penalty, it would be financing future regulation of its industry. And that may prove to be the case's most important legacy of all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/24/business/buyback-by-mgm-grand.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-06-24", "snippet": "MGM Grand Inc plans to buy back up to 12 million shares, or about 20 percent of its common stock; stock climbs $5.5625 a share, to $32.1875 (S)", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buyback by MGM Grand", "print_headline": "Buyback by MGM Grand", "body_text": " **********MGM Grand Inc. plans to buy back up to 12 million shares, or about 20 percent of its common stock.

Mud raced down into Sarno and other hill towns from at least 17 slides, which look like brown veins coursing through the mountain. Little had been left in the way of trees and brush to halt it. **********''The mountain has been burned systematically,'' said Andrea Giordani, 42, a town land surveyor who was sorting mud-stained family snapshots found in the rubble in Episcopio, a suburb of Sarno nestled nearest the mountain. ''It's been on everybody's lips for years. We've discussed it at the City Council. We knew this could happen.

A box spring dangled precariously over the edge. **********Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who on Friday pledged $30 million for relief and reconstruction, attended the funeral with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. **********Nearly 4,000 firefighters, troops, forest rangers and medical workers, including 80 United States marines based in Naples, have helped with the rescue operation. **********Robert Robustelli, 22, was found alive on Friday after lying buried in rubble for three days, but hope of finding other survivors has faded. **********At the Edmondo de Amiciis Elementary School, one of five schools turned into emergency shelters, 260 survivors were camped out. Maria Marangelo, 33, sat on a cot, feeding  her month-old-son, Giuseppe, by bottle as her 4-year-old, Antonio, played nearby. **********She could not find Antonio when the mud hit her prefab home, a leftover from the 1980 earthquake, which killed nearly 3,000 people in Campania. ''I grabbed the baby and jumped out a window seven feet up,'' she said. **********Her brother-in-law found Antonio and dragged him to safety. **********Mrs. D'Angelo's niece died in the mudslides.

He has even praised as heroes the I.R.A. guerrillas who have killed hundreds of people in their fight to force Britain out of the North. **********Mr. Adams was among the political party leaders who approved the agreement eight days ago. But vigorous criticism of the accord by Republican hard-liners has been pushing him to say the things he knows will please those zealots who believe the I.R.A. is wrong to observe a cease-fire and that Mr. Adams is a traitor. **********Mr. Adams has been assisted in his campaign by the way the peace agreement was approved on April 10. It was announced in Belfast by George J. Mitchell, the former United States Senator who was chairman of the peace talks. Although Mr. Adams and seven other Northern Irish party leaders conveyed their verbal support for the agreement to Mr. Mitchell, they signed nothing. **********This has allowed Mr. Adams to have it both ways: to moderates in the Republican movement, he approved the agreement. To hard-liners, he put nothing in writing and did not commit Sinn Fein to anything. **********Mr. Adams's primary concern is to avoid a split in his party that could weaken it in the referendum to be held on May 22. **********Today, delegates at a Sinn Fein conference here voted to delay for two weeks a decision on whether to endorse it. Mr. Adams urged the delegates to consider the positive aspects of the agreement. **********The loudest outburst of applause, though, came when he called the I.R.A. ''undefeated and undefeatable.'' When he noted that it had ''done things that were wrong,'' there was silence. **********Irish and British officials say that if Sinn Fein rejects the document and refuses to take part in the new political structure envisioned for the North, the peace effort could collapse into a new round of terrorist attacks by both sides. Northern Ireland's police chief has warned that he expects violence to continue even with an agreement. **********To placate the Republican hard-liners after the April 10 announcement, Mr. Adams and Martin McGuinness, the party's chief negotiator, immediately went out to make their case. **********Last Sunday, at a celebration marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, Mr. Adams told a Republican group that the agreement was ''another phase of our struggle,'' acknowledging that he had not won a united Ireland. But he praised the I.R.A. guerrillas for their ''tenacity and commitment,'' adding that he honored ''not just to their role when they make war, but also to their role when they provide the opportunity for making peace.'' **********The I.R.A. has been responsible for about half of the 3,200 deaths in the sectarian fighting in Northern Ireland since 1969. Mr. Adams was admitted to the peace talks on the condition of an I.R.A. cease-fire, which was called last July, and on his pledge to shun violence. **********Mr. McGuinness said he and Mr. Adams wanted to insure ''there is enough in the constitutional stuff to move us forward, in a transitional way, to our primary objective, which is still and always will be the eventual reunification of Ireland.'' **********The ''constitutional stuff'' would greatly change the political structure in Northern Ireland. The agreement, if approved in the referendum, will establish a new assembly with a voting system giving the Catholic minority more power. This assembly will then establish a North-South council to give the Irish Republic more influence in the North's affairs. **********Hard-liners want Dublin to retain its constitutional claim to sovereignty in the North. But the agreement removes the word ''territory'' from the claim to sovereignty, and says that anyone born on the island may be part of the Irish nation, an undefined concept. It also says there will be no united Ireland unless the majority approves it. The majority is likely to remain Protestant well into the new century."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/27/world/memo-from-moscow-yeltsin-the-improviser-bathing-in-new-limelight.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Specter", "pub_date": "1998-03-27", "snippet": "Andrei A Piontkowsky, director of Center for Strategic Studies in Moscow, says Pres Boris Yeltsin is making Russian Government up as he goes along, and that even he has no idea how it will turn out; in fact, senior aides say Yeltsin settled on Ser...", "word_count": 829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Memo From Moscow; Yeltsin the Improviser, Bathing in New Limelight", "print_headline": "Memo From Moscow; Yeltsin the Improviser, Bathing in New Limelight", "body_text": " **********Nothing gives Boris N. Yeltsin more pleasure than playing dice with his little piece of the universe. **********His speech is still slow after much illness, and his movements stiff and labored. But since Monday, when he dismissed his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, after five years of unfailing loyalty, Mr. Yeltsin has had a mischievous gleam in his eye. **********That's because he is back where he needs to be: on the center of every stage. Mr. Yeltsin entertained two world leaders here today -- Jacques Chirac of France and Helmut Kohl of Germany -- but he still took time from his busy schedule to toy with the man he has temporarily dropped into Mr. Chernomyrdin's shoes. **********Asked this morning if he would appoint Sergei Kiriyenko, the relatively unknown reform politician, as the permanent Prime Minister, Mr. Yeltsin, who is 67, wrinkled his face like a boy playing a prank on a schoolmate and said, ''Maybe yes, maybe no.'' **********He is expected to visit Mr. Kiriyenko, the 35-year-old former Energy and Fuel Minister, in the Government headquarters on Friday to see what he has in mind. But few people who have watched Mr. Yeltsin operate over the years think that visit will have anything to do with who becomes Prime Minister. **********''Sometimes you forget that Boris Yeltsin is not a child but the leader of an enormous nation with a large nuclear arsenal,'' said Andrei A.  Piontkowsky, director of the Center for Strategic Studies, a research group here. ''He is making the Russian Government up as he goes along. Even he has no idea how it will turn out.'' **********That seems clear from the President's actions this week. He did not settle on Mr. Kiriyenko out of a sense that he would make a great leader of a newly invigorated reform Cabinet. He appointed him, according to senior aides in the Kremlin, because he had made a mistake and had to come up with a name in a hurry. **********At first, in a speech before the nation, he named himself Acting Prime Minister. ''But the lawyers here had to go and tell him that was against the law and the Constitution,'' said a Kremlin official who asked not to be identified. ''So he was forced to find someone else.'' **********Mr. Yeltsin then called Mr. Kiriyenko, the young ally of First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, and told him to form a government. **********Mr. Kiriyenko may have much to recommend him to Russia right now: He is a hard-working technocrat from the oil industry. He is well-liked by those who work with him, and he is not stridently ideological. While he is a friend of the liberal Mr. Nemtsov, he considers himself a protege of the far-more centrist Mr. Chernomyrdin. But for Mr. Yeltsin,  Mr. Kiriyenko's most important characteristic is that he has no power base. **********''From the presidential point of view the successful candidate for Prime Minister must have the important merit of complete political weakness,'' Sergei Chugayev, wrote in the Friday issue of Izvestia. ''The last thing this President wants is a Premier with an influential movement behind him.'' In fact, officials in the Kremlin say that one of the factors that precipitated the dismissal of Mr. Chernomyrdin is that he seemed ''immodest'' at a recent meeting with Vice President Al Gore in Washington. ''They were both acting like future Presidents,'' a Kremlin aide told the newspaper Obshchaya Gazeta, ''and that is not tolerated.'' **********But somebody has to be a future president if Russia is going to be a democracy. Unless Mr. Yeltsin changes the rules -- and many think he will try -- he is barred by the Constitution from running for office again. With his health failing and his political future starting to seem dim, the President has simply relied on one of his oldest habits: Get rid of anyone who could challenge his power. **********Mr. Yeltsin's Lone-Ranger act fits easily into Russia's long history of  autocratic leaders. But his credentials as a democrat, long faded, are becoming almost irreparably tarnished. The Communists in Parliament are often laughed off by the Kremlin and by the mainstream press. They have little power. But when the speaker announced on Wednesday that he is not at all sure that Mr. Kiriyenko could get confirmed as Prime Minister, he did not seem to be posturing. And what he said could hardly be called unfair. **********''He is little-known here,'' said Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of Parliament. ''He has never been a governor. He does not have the economic experience to run Russia's huge economy. If he is the candidate who is proposed as the head of the Government, all this would be a major obstacle to his approval.'' **********That does not worry Mr. Yeltsin, though. If Parliament rejects his candidate three times, he can disband it and call new elections. **********''We will be strong,'' Mr. Yeltsin said today, apparently referring to himself.

As the company, the nation's largest long-distance telephone carrier, has struggled to remake itself amid heavy turbulence in the telecommunications industry, it continues to find that thousands of its employees are superfluous. **********In preparing for this latest round of cuts, the company seems to be taking lessons not only from its own experience in encouraging employee exits but also from those of the variety of companies that have made white-collar layoffs one of the decade's corporate vogues. **********A result may be a kinder, gentler sort of downsizing. Compared with AT&T's previous efforts at shrinkage, this one relies less on layoffs and more on generous provisions intended to attract volunteers. **********One advantage of such treatment is better workplace morale. Less acknowledged, however, is a potential disadvantage: Often, companies lose more of their most talented people than they would like. **********Still, the push toward gentler severance has been picked up nationally. In 1996, companies tracked by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm based in Chicago, gave workers who were being laid off severance pay worth an average of 12.75 weeks' salary. Last year, that figure soared to 21.75 weeks. **********Certainly, many large companies can afford to be more generous these days than they could a few years ago, and tax rules are making largess  more attractive. But at a company like AT&T, where downsizing announcements have become almost as regular as annual reports, enhancing buyout packages can be vital to shoring up shaky employee morale. **********''Companies are recognizing that they run a real risk of losing the good will of the employees who remain, who are friends with the people who leave,'' said John A. Challenger, executive vice president at the Challenger company. ''They run the risk that the people who remain, who are being asked to work longer and harder, are going to resent that, especially since they no longer feel they necessarily have lifetime job security. **********''The companies have got to put together packages to show that this is a no-fault situation.'' **********WHEN AT&T said in January 1996 that it intended to eliminate 40,000 of its 301,000 jobs, the announcement seemed like the crest of a mounting wave of corporate cutbacks. **********Of those 40,000 jobs, 30,000 were to be cut by involuntary layoffs. Another 4,000 workers were to leave as the company sold their divisions; only 6,500 were to leave after accepting a voluntary buyout package that had expired the week before the layoffs were announced. **********Morale at the company was crippled; Robert E. Allen, then AT&T's chairman, found his picture on the cover of Newsweek magazine, in a police-style lineup under the headline ''Corporate Killers.'' **********By contrast, last month's announcement elicited hardly a yawn. At AT&T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., some midlevel managers -- the group that is the cuts' target -- were almost giddy. **********That may have been because this time about two-thirds of the cuts will come through voluntary retirements, part of the richest buyout plan in AT&T's history, and one that will be made available to most AT&T managers. About a third of the staff cuts will be achieved through attrition and layoffs. **********''We want to send the right message to our employees,'' said Adele Ambrose, an AT&T spokeswoman, ''that we need to get cost-competitive but we wanted to be generous to them and express that we care about them.'' **********Many companies care about their employees, but managing a work-force reduction is rarely as simple as paying enough. **********Management experts say that weighting cuts toward voluntary buyouts, as AT&T has done, avoids many morale-destroying effects of involuntary layoffs, but gives a company less control over which and how many employees depart. **********''Very often you lose the wrong people,'' said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford University's business school who has contended that downsizing hurts companies at least as often as it helps them. ''You often wind up hiring people back as temps, and oftentimes you've lost so much in morale and productivity that you don't really cut costs.'' **********AT&T said senior executives would be able to offer incentives to especially productive groups of employees to induce them to stay. **********But the tight labor market and the relatively good prospects for employment elsewhere could entice  some AT&T workers who would stay with the company in more difficult economic times, said Lee Miller, an employment consultant and author of ''Get More Money on Your Next Job'' (McGraw-Hill). **********''Since we really haven't seen this kind of job market in a while, companies are likely to underestimate the number and type of people who take these offers,'' he said. **********AT&T is offering managers a choice of buyouts. They can take a 20 percent bonus to their pensions, or they can choose an addition to the cash they can take in lieu of a pension -- by an amount equal to 5 percent of their 1997 salary for each year of service to the company, up to 100 percent. **********For buyout participants, AT&T also intends to lower the age and experience requirements for post-employment medical coverage. **********The buyout will be offered to most of AT&T's roughly 60,000 managers. Managers make up almost half of the company's 128,000 employees. **********A convergence of Federal tax law and the current bull market may have played a role in the buyout's design. The tax code allows companies to deduct from their taxable revenue the contributions that they make to employee pension funds, as long as the total size of the fund does not exceed 150 percent of the company's pension obligations. **********As the stock market has swelled, some companies' pension funds have exceeded that 150 percent limit, encouraging the companies to spend some of that money in buyout programs to allow them to continue deducting their fund contributions. **********AT&T denied that such circumstances were driving the terms of this buyout, saying that its $12.5 billion pension fund for management is only 125 percent of its obligations and that the last time the company made a contribution to the fund was in 1995. **********For all of its downsizing efforts, AT&T has not become much smaller in recent years. **********The company has almost completely offset the cut jobs with new hires in growth areas of the company, like Internet and wireless telephone service. And AT&T has made no commitment that the buyout will result in any net reductions in its work force. **********That fits with the views of James E. Schrager, a clinical professor of strategy at the University of Chicago's business school. **********''What have companies learned from downsizing?'' he asked. ''They've learned that it's very hard to fire too many people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/business/international-business-cinderella-italy-preps-for-euro-ball-but-midnight-nears.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1998-05-15", "snippet": "President of Italian central bank warns that next few years will be 'purgatory' for Italians as economy adjusts to European demands and adapts to single new euro currency; Italian businessmen are preparing for euro in different ways; Italian compa...", "word_count": 1789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- Cinderella, Italy Preps For Euro Ball; But as Midnight Nears, Some Business Sectors Brace for Pain", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- Cinderella, Italy Preps For Euro Ball; But as Midnight Nears, Some Business Sectors Brace for Pain", "body_text": " **********Giovanni Franco Masello sheds no tears over the imminent demise of the Italian lira. Pietro Montagna sometimes wishes the funeral could be delayed a bit. **********Both are Italian businessmen, and both want the euro, Europe's nascent single currency, and the benefits it will ultimately bring for their companies. Yet they are preparing for it in very different ways. **********Mr. Masello's pottery company, which is not far from this northern Italian city, some 40 miles west of Venice, will post prices for its products in both lire and euros when it issues new price lists later this year. But the supermarket chain based in Milan where Mr. Montagna works is asking the Government in Rome to slow things down. Instead of issuing customer receipts in both lire and euros in the transition phase to the new currency that begins next Jan. 1, as the Government has asked, the chain wants the receipts to be only in lire until the euro is fully introduced in 2002. **********Deroma S.p.A., the pottery maker where Mr. Masello is chief executive, is embracing the euro because it is one of thousands of thriving small and medium-size companies in Italy that have already become regional and international players, a status and a strategy that the euro is intended to enhance. With the euro, the burden of converting the lira to a dozen different currencies will disappear, and as the single currency pushes Europe to become even more integrated economically, Deroma is poised to grab a bigger chunk of the market than it has now. **********''Our idea,'' Mr. Masello said, ''is for a production site in every country in which we sell.'' **********But Standa S.p.A., the big supermarket chain where Mr. Montagna is head of computer services, is in a sector under siege. Long shielded from real competition by the kind of protectionist policies that the euro is intended to bring down, the Italian retail trade, along with banking and other sectors, expects mainly pain, at least in the near term. Converting cash registers and consumer behavior to the new money will be costly. What is more, the expense is coming at a time when Italian retailers are already under assault from big competitors elsewhere in Europe that are expanding here. **********Similar contrasts in expectations are being felt throughout Europe as companies and industries prepare, from different starting points, for the euro, which will replace the currencies of 11 countries in the European Union. But in few countries are the differences as stark, or the potential gains and wrenching costs as substantial, as they are in Italy. Indeed, looming over both ends of the economy here, the strong and the weak, are the special uncertainties of Italy S.p.A. **********To qualify for admission to the European monetary club, and thus become eligible to use the euro, Italy had to cut its budget deficit sharply. That meant raising income taxes on corporations that had already been paying the highest rates in Europe. It also meant paring investments in transportation and communications, even though those still fall well below the northern European standard. **********Then there is Italy's depressed south, with its high unemployment rate, which is a millstone around the neck of the economy as a whole. Germany has its depressed east, and Spain its pockets of backwardness. But interest charges on Italy's bloated national debt, which is double the target set for countries adopting the euro, pre-empt the kinds of spending programs Germany began in the east after the fall of the Berlin wall. **********What all this means, of course, is that if the current downward trend in interest rates reverses and the cost of money begins to rise again, Italy will have to tighten its belt further, even at the risk of provoking an economic slowdown, higher unemployment and social unrest. Resistance from labor unions, and from leftist parties within the Government itself, would be intense. **********Little wonder then that Antonio Fazio, president of the Italian central bank, warns that the next few years will be ''purgatory'' for Italians as the economy adjusts to European demands and is forced to adapt. **********What is encouraging to the experts are the number of businesses, like Deroma, that seem as well positioned as any in Europe to meet the challenges the euro will pose. **********Deroma, the world's largest pottery maker, expects revenue of $91 million this year, a fivefold increase from a decade ago. Founded in the 1950's by local potters, Deroma single-handedly industrialized pottery production in the 1970's and then reinvented itself as a mini-multinational. In the early 90's, Deroma pushed aggressively beyond Italy's borders, grabbing back the marketing of its products in Europe and the United States from local distributors and then building or acquiring factories in Denmark, China and, most recently, the United States. Now, virtually all the terra-cotta pottery found at big American retailers like Home Depot and Wal-Mart originates in Deroma kilns. **********Companies like Deroma are the very backbone of the Italian economy, said Franco Bruni, an economist at Bocconi University, the business school in Milan. ''These concentrations of small and medium-size companies with flexible structures are among the best'' on the Continent, he said, and the euro will be a boon for them. **********For many, he said, it will afford ''emancipation from the costs of small Italian banks'' while fostering cross-country networking, particularly in areas like those around Vicenza that are close to powerful economic regions farther north. By removing obstacles to companies' expansion, such as the cost of protecting themselves from changes in exchange rates, the euro will promote expansion across borders into neighboring countries. **********But the chronicle of Deroma's growth also illustrates many of Italy's deficiencies. **********Wages in Italy are so high that Mr. Masello, Deroma's chief executive, had no inhibitions about moving production abroad, concentrating the manufacture of labor-intensive painted pottery in China, for example, and acquiring a pottery maker in Marshall, Tex., last year. **********Italian banking is so costly and provincial that to finance Deroma's growth, Mr. Masello took the very un-Italian step of selling shares on the Milan stock exchange, thus avoiding the debt that makes Italian companies, as he puts it, ''the salvation of the banking system.'' (Deroma is one of only two of the 2,200 industrial companies in the Vicenza area listed on the Milan bourse.) Even then, to manage the stock sale, he chose Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, though he also brought into the syndicate Credito Italiano, one of the best-run Italian banks, ''to include a national bank.'' **********And so rigid is the Italian labor market, and so immobile have Italians become thanks to generous welfare and unemployment payments, that despite unemployment of more than 20 percent in the south of Italy, Deroma employs 40 to 50 non-Europeans, mainly from India and Africa, among its roughly 1,500 workers. **********Still, not all of Italian business shares Deroma's dynamism, and what troubles some experts is the relative weakness of key sectors of the economy, like banking. To cushion that industry, Italy long maintained high barriers to foreign entry. Now the euro is expected to open the floodgates to foreign capital. **********Luigi Spaventa, a former Finance Minister who is chairman of a regional Tuscan bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, said Italian banks were so burdened by Italian bureaucracy that it could take up to 10 years to recover a loan gone bad. **********That will prove costly when the euro arrives, he said. While the local banks may hold on to less profitable businesses, like retail banking, they could well lose more lucrative activities like wholesale banking, investment banking and financial products to powerful foreign competitors. ''There will ultimately be casualties,'' Mr. Spaventa said. **********The retail trade is equally fragile. Long protected by a Government that favored small family-owned distribution, thousands of mom and pop stores now face a shakeout. Though the stores may be part of the charm of Italian cities, their inefficiency and high prices fuel inflation and dampen consumption. Already, foreign supermarket chains like Auchan S.A. of France have begun invading northern Italy. **********To defend their turf, Italian chains are banding together. Standa, which is controlled by the holding company Fininvest S.p.A., recently joined a purchasing alliance with two other supermarket groups. Even thus united, they are dwarfed by European rivals. While Tengelmann Warenhandels of Germany, best known in the United States for its A.& P. supermarkets, has $40 billion in annual sales, Standa and its partners together account for only $8.5 billion. **********''In Italy, the first five supermarket groups together do less business than Tengelmann,'' Standa's Mr. Montagna said. **********Moreover, the debilitating north-south divide remains. While Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the current Finance Minister, says that reviving the south is his highest priority after the euro, executives like Mr. Masello are skeptical. **********Asked whether Deroma would invest in southern Italy, Mr. Masello complained of excessive production in the country, where 70 percent of Deroma's pottery originates. Wages in the south roughly equal those in the north, he noted, despite lower productivity, making operations there prohibitively expensive. Add to that the region's poor railroads and highways, and the reason for his refusal is clear. He envisions instead a Europe-wide investment program for depressed regions. **********The struggles of the Italian south, some experts warn, will also keep the pressure on politicians to relax the Government's austerity program. In Naples, the capital of the Campania region, where the 26 percent joblessness rate is more than double the national average, tens of thousands of people marched in the streets in March to demand jobs. **********The immediate social cost to Italy of the euro will be high, said Sergio De Nardis, an economist at Confindustria, an industrialists association. ''The benefits will come only in the medium to long term,'' he added. The simple truth, he said, is that old habits of protecting and cosseting industries die hard. **********Sometimes, even issues of prestige get in the way. **********That happened recently when the struggling national airline, Alitalia, said that it would shift about 10 percent of the flights that now depart from Rome to a new airport being built near Milan. The change was intended to lure back Italian business travelers in the north who now find it easier to go to Frankfurt or Zurich, and fly with Lufthansa or Swissair, than to trek south to Rome. **********The Foreign Ministry begged the Government to intervene and reverse the decision. Lamberto Dini, the Foreign Minister, complained that the shift in flights, besides taking business from Rome, would ''provoke not a little embarrassment for the image of Italy.'' **********Only after it became clear that reversing the decision would jeopardize a crucial alliance between Alitalia and the Dutch carrier KLM did the Government silence Mr. Dini and give profitability priority over image. **********Though such persistent political intrusions are disheartening, Mr. De Nardis said, the prompt Government refusal was also reassuring, illustrating a growing gap in Italy ''between rhetoric and reality.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/business/company-news-maker-of-monitor-screens-eliminating-580-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-07-25", "snippet": "BMC Industries to eliminate 430 permanent and 150 temporary jobs in shutdown of three production lines at Cortland, NY, plant (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MAKER OF MONITOR SCREENS ELIMINATING 580 JOBS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MAKER OF MONITOR SCREENS ELIMINATING 580 JOBS", "body_text": " **********BMC Industries, a maker of television and computer monitor screens, will eliminate 430 permanent positions and 150 temporary jobs in the shutdown of three production lines at a plant in Cortland, N.Y.

But Mr. Schroder, whose Social Democrats inflicted a crushing defeat on Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sunday, said the birth of the ''Berlin republic'' had a deeper meaning for him. **********It represented a ''new beginning,''  he said, one combining the strong German democratic culture built up during the last half-century with the ''civil courage shown in the unification of this country.'' **********The allusion to unification was telling, for in the difficult, hugely expensive marriage of the west and the formerly Communist east lay the seeds of Mr. Schroder's sweeping victory. **********Germany, shaken by the high unemployment engendered partly by unification, has shifted leftward. It has also shifted eastward away from the conservative Rhineland culture of Mr. Kohl and the first postwar Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, toward as yet untried forms of government. **********In all likelihood, Germany will now be governed for the first time by a ''Red-Green'' coalition, bringing together the Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens. This in turn will mean important shifts -- away from the restrictive immigration laws that have shaped many Germans' view of their society, toward possible new ''ecology taxes'' on energy, and against a complete deregulation of Germany's ''social market'' economy. **********''The core of the Bonn republic was Christian, Catholic, southwestern,'' said Claus Leggewie, a German political scientist. ''The center of gravity has now moved east, where the electorate is completely different, opening up political options that never existed before.'' **********Of course, those options will be limited by Germany's strong commitment to the NATO alliance and to the European Union. But from an essentially conservative nation, it seems likely to become a cautiously experimental one. **********In the former East Germany and Berlin, support for Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats imploded. The party won about 27.3 percent of the vote, down from 37.5 percent in 1994. At the same time, support surged for Mr. Schroder's Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the East German Communist party. **********Against the prediction of most people, including themselves, the Social Democrats and the Greens won a clear majority in Parliament. **********A government of the two parties would embody the arrival in power of a postwar generation that took part in the wave of leftist protests of the 1960's -- Joschka Fischer, the Greens' most influential single figure was particularly active -- and subsequently evolved toward the pragmatism that was the hallmark of Mr. Schroder's victory. **********But if realism has tempered the idealism of youth in the case of both Mr. Schroder and Mr. Fischer, a Red-Green German government would still represent a radical departure. **********Mr. Schroder today warned that the Greens should prepare themselves for ''tough negotiations,'' and he is certain to rein in their most extremist wing, known as the Fundis. Nonetheless, policy will shift. **********At the very least, Mr. Schroder and Mr. Fischer made clear today, Germany's immigration laws seem certain to change, reflecting the extent to which this has become a multi-ethnic society. ''We will make it possible to have dual citizenship,'' Mr. Schroder said. ''We will find a solution to this.'' **********This reform, strongly supported by the Greens and resisted by the Christian Democrats, would probably make it possible for immigrants' children born in this country to gain German citizenship. **********There are more than seven million foreigners in Germany, in a population of 82 million. Such a change in the law would represent a marked shift away from the Christian Democratic vision of Germany as a place rooted in the ''homogeneity'' of the German people. This view was held with a relentless conviction against the mounting evidence to the contrary. **********On the treacherous economic front, the Social Democrats and the Greens will certainly find it more difficult to harmonize their positions. One Green leader, Jurgen Trittin, today called for the closing, as fast as possible, of Germany's 20 nuclear power stations -- a demand Mr. Schroder will regard as unrealistic. **********Still, the two parties are likely to be united in a desire to preserve at least the bedrock of Germany's and Europe's welfare system against more radical free-market reforms inspired by Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher. In this sense, they will stand against the wholesale ''Americanization'' of Europe. **********Both Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party and probably the next Finance Minister, and Mr. Fischer, who may become Foreign Minister, are adamant about the defense of minimum social, ecological and welfare standards against the complete deregulation that global markets have tended to inspire. **********But the central issue confronting the parties -- Germany's 4.1 million unemployed -- is certain to provoke tensions. The Greens want to lower Germany's high wage costs, one of the main barriers to employment, with taxes on energy, including gasoline, to discourage the use of cars while raising money to defray employers' social welfare costs. **********The Social Democrats, meanwhile, have wavered between assurances to businessmen about lowering taxes and making the labor market less rigid and pledges to workers about improved pensions and sick pay. **********This tension is symbolized by the likely presence in the government of Mr. Lafontaine at the Finance Ministry and the self-made millionaire businessman, Jost Stollmann, at the Economics Ministry. **********Mr. Schroder confirmed today that Mr. Stollmann, who is deeply suspect to the average Social Democratic Party member, would be in the Cabinet -- a declaration clearly aimed at reassuring businessmen. **********But Hans-Olaf Henkel, the president of the Federation of Germany Industry, bitterly attacked the Greens' proposals for ecological taxes and an end to nuclear power, and said industry was ''certainly nervous'' about a Red-Green coalition. **********On one point, the Social Democrats and Greens do agree. Both want to call a conference bringing together employers and labor unions to discuss a program to create jobs, perhaps through pledges of wage restraint from unions and pledges of jobs from employers. **********''We cannot bring down unemployment against the will of the employers or without the cooperation of the unions,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''We have to work with both.'' **********It was a remark typical of the postwar German quest for consensus, the very essence of the long-formidable ''social market economy'' that propelled the country from postwar ruin to great prosperity. **********If a radical shift to a new Berlin republic is under way, it is equally clear that there will also be strong elements of continuity and compromise under the new generation now set to govern Europe's most powerful nation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-03-24", "snippet": "German mark rallies to end higher after traders conclude Cabinet shake-up in Russia could help economic relations with Germany; dollar costs 1.8256 marks in New York; graphs; chart (S)", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********MARK GAINS.

They had been waiting for two days. **********''I went to my parents, but they said they had nothing to feed the children,'' said Mrs. Tong, 38, whose husband was killed when soldiers looted their farm in October, making off with all of their sorghum and cattle. ''There is no way I can feed them. I'm just relying on the little I can receive from the aid workers. If I receive nothing, they will die.'' **********Mrs. Tong and the others in Adet are the victims of what many aid officials characterize as a campaign by the Islamic Government in Khartoum to starve people in rebel-held territories because they support guerrillas fighting for an autonomous south. **********For nearly two months the Government has banned relief flights to all but four airstrips in the region, arguing that it is insecure. **********Heavy fighting broke out again in the state of Bahr el Ghazal on Jan. 28, when Kuanyin Kerubino Bol, a local rogue rebel leader who had been fighting on the Government's side for several years, switched sides again and attacked an army garrison. **********The ban on flights has crippled the relief operation at a time when people have little food left in storage after two years of drought, not to mention several years of looting and cattle raids from outlaw rebel factions as well as Islamic militias from the north, United Nations officials said. **********Aid organizations lack enough trucks to haul the food to the villages where it is most needed, and there are no good roads. **********So food is being stockpiled in places like Adet, while children are beginning to starve in towns like Theik Thou, just 60 miles away, aid officials said. ''It's a deliberately planned strategy,'' said one aid worker, who insisted on anonymity, as he distributed cereal to hungry children. ''It's cheaper to them if many people die. To kill them with bombs and bullets is very expensive.'' **********Even in Adet, many of the infants and old people among the displaced who arrived too late for the first disbursement of food have grown emaciated and weak. Desperate for nourishment, women of the Dinka ethnic group are harvesting bitter beans from tamarind trees and collecting leaves and wild fruit to eat, a strategy they do not usually employ until much later in the year, just before harvest. **********''They are surviving now on wild food,'' said Claude Jibidar, the field coordinator in southern Sudan for the United Nations World Food Program. ''In a month's time, or two months' at the latest, the situation is going to deteriorate drastically.'' **********Mr. Jibidar and other United Nations officials predict that there will be widespread famine in Bahr el Ghazal within a year unless United Nations airplanes based in Kenya are allowed to carry food shipments to more locations. **********It was in Bahr el Ghazal that 250,000 people perished in a war-related famine in 1989, prompting the United Nations to begin the airlift operation from northern Kenya, which is still supplying most of the medicine, relief food and social services to the Sudan's south. **********Since late January, the World Food Program has managed to send about 262 metric tons of food to the four open airstrips, using airdrops and small cargo planes, while an unusual convoy of trucks carried in another 360 tons from Uganda. **********''If they don't give us access, in three or four months it will be too late,'' Mr. Jibidar said. ''We will suddenly be dealing with 500,000 people when they do not have the resources to survive. The quantity of food we are taking into Bahr el Ghazal today can't help the situation.'' **********To make matters worse, the Government stepped up its bombing campaign since Mr. Kerubino's defection. **********Nearly every day since late January, a Russian-built cargo plane has prowled the sky over the region, rolling a dozen cluster bombs out of a rear cargo bay. **********Because the pilots have no sighting system, the bombs often fall on civilian locations, military experts said. In the worst attack so far this year, 16 civilians were killed when a bomb hit a market in the town of Thiet on March 1. **********The bombing has not only disrupted farming by forcing thousands to leave their homes at a time when they would normally be clearing land in advance of the April rains, but it has demoralized many farmers who have struggled for years to eke out a living. **********Gong Mayar, 40, a Dinka farmer near the Adet airstrip, said he heard the low and distant buzz of the plane's engines on Feb. 8 before he heard the sound of the bomb falling, a whooshing sound like rain. Then came the shattering blow of the explosion. The earth shuddered. **********He ran out of his thatched house and found his wife, Arok Reec, 25, face down in the dust about 50 yards away, bleeding from the back and the head. He carried her back to their mud-walled home and laid her near her two children. The baby wailed. His wife could not utter a word. **********''She was still alive,'' the farmer said. ''But within five minutes she passed away. I do not know what this war is about. What I know is that they are just killing indiscriminately. They are not targeting the people who are fighting them.'' **********The death of Mr. Mayar's wife was a final, crushing blow to a man who had kept farming through waves of looting and cattle rustling by rebels and pro-Government Arab militias alike. His herd of cattle, once numbering 27, has been reduced to 7 pitiful creatures. Two years of bad harvests mean that he has only one 170-pound basket of grain saved to plant when the rains come. **********It is not nearly enough, he says, to survive until the next harvest in August. **********The daily bombing, coupled with renewed fighting around the towns of Wau, Gogrial and Aweil, has displaced at least 130,000 people, United Nations officials said. These people have fled without food into a ravaged countryside where local farmers have little food to spare, aid workers said. **********''The U.N. planes are dropping food while the Government planes are dropping bombs,'' said Maalak Ayien, an aid worker with Save the Children, as he distributed cereal rations to children. ''The Government here is trying to destroy wealth. They keep everyone displaced. People become hungry.'' **********Since 1983 various rebel groups from the mostly Christian and animist southern states have been fighting successive governments dominated by Arabs from the mostly Islamic north. Most of the rebel groups maintain that they are fighting for independence or just for more political autonomy and greater religious freedom. Almost all demand the repeal of harsh Islamic laws enacted in the 1980's. **********But the rebellion has been crippled from its inception by infighting among ethnic factions as well as by rogue commanders who have used the conflict as an excuse to loot and to enrich themselves. **********Several rebel commanders signed a peace agreement with Khartoum last year and have been fighting their old allies with guns provided by the Government. **********One of them was Mr. Kerubino, a Dinka warlord from Gogrial who fought on the Government's side for four years. His decision in January to rejoin the main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army under John Garang, was welcome news to many farmers. For years they had been looted by Mr. Kerubino's underpaid troops. **********In Adet, Mr. Kerubino's realignment has brought about a relative calm. Despite the sound of bombs and shelling most mornings around Wau, 20 miles to the south, most people here say hunger is their biggest enemy now. **********Many of the refugees in Adet said the traditional Dinka ways of coping with food shortages had been destroyed by years of warfare. Most people have been forced to flee their homes several times in last decade, abandoning farms and livestock for refugee camps in towns like Wau, where they have been reduced to making charcoal or selling firewood for a living. **********Not only have they lost their loved ones, but they have lost the tools to survive, including their cattle and supplies of seed, in the endless raiding and looting that has characterized this conflict for more than a decade. **********Bar Akec, 56, an emaciated charcoal merchant from Wau, said he had lost his herd of cattle to Arab raiders in Aweil County a decade ago and moved to a refugee camp in Wau, where he sold charcoal to survive. His wife was shot in the head in front of him during the fighting for that town on Jan. 28. **********He fled with his three children and walked north for five days. He left his children with strangers in a village a few miles away because they were too weak to go on, and he marched on to Adet alone in the hope of getting grain to take back to them. He said he had been waiting here for two days. **********''If I don't get food, then that's the end of my children,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/22/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-04-22", "snippet": "German mark surges on jump in Germany's money supply, increasing possibility of higher interest rates there; in New York, dollar falls to 1.7884 marks from 1.8012, its lowest level since Jan 26; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********MARK AT 2 1/2-MONTH HIGH.

Inside the dentist's waiting room, nervous patients thumb through ancient magazines. A drill squeals from the back room. Mouths go dry, throats gulp. But then, seeping from the ceiling, comes a gentle melody in soft lapping waves. By the time the work starts, the patient is calm and relaxed. **********This is one of the promises of Muzak, the ubiquitous music heard in Crate & Barrel and Citibank, in malls and McDonald's. Here it calms and there it soothes, not to mention the Muzak company's sales pitch: that properly chosen background music can boost sales and increase productivity. **********But now, instead of the Muzak stereotype of endless blenderized instrumental versions of songs like ''Afternoon Delight,'' the company is offering the rapper Puff Daddy and the grunge rock band Nirvana, lyrics and all, in the quarter of a million businesses that buy Muzak's wares. **********In July, the Seattle-based company unveiled an extensive image makeover. It's all part of a new campaign to take this often ridiculed business into the next millennium as a hipper, more creative version of its former self. **********Over the company's 65-year history, it has doggedly built its reputation -- and melodies -- on what it called ''the science of business music.'' Muzak was founded in the early 1920's by Maj. Gen. George Owen Squier, a retired Army Signal Corps officer.  Something of a protogeek, General Squier experimented with ways to deliver music directly into homes using electrical lines. **********His company, originally known as Wired Radio, began transmitting over telephone lines, later expanding its broadcasts into hotels and restaurants. A 1937 study by  British industrial psychologists, ''Fatigue and Boredom in the Workplace,'' reinforced General Squier's efforts, finding that under certain ''planned sound conditions, productivity in work areas is stepped up,'' according to Muzak's company history. **********This morale-boosting science remained Muzak's mantra for decades. In a brochure sent to prospective clients in the mid-1990's, Muzak touted the ''subtle psychological lifts'' of its specially designed tunes. A patented process the company called ''Stimulus Progression'' was developed to counter an employee's ''work efficiency dips'' (photos show a scientist taking notes while a young man covered in electrodes listens to Muzak). **********This is the way stimulus progression works, according to Muzak: most employees have a dip in productivity around 10:30 A.M. To counter that, stimulating music -- chosen for its variations in tempo and instrumentation -- is piped in through office intercoms. **********''Muzak can motivate achievement,'' the brochure says. ''Stimulate sales. Inspire creativity. Decrease absenteeism. And increase productivity. Muzak creates the sound of better business for everyone.'' **********Muzak's vice president, Alvin Collis, said the sound has changed. ''Background music used to play a covert role in a particular environment,'' he said. ''Now businesses recognize that they can put the power of music to work to create emotional connections. It's all about team building.'' **********As a result, Muzak has jettisoned the flavor of its past promotion for a spunkier, MTV-style approach. New brochures ditch the graphs and wires of the old days for shots of Muzak tattoos and snowboards. **********The staff members are no longer electrode-wielding men with clipboards tweaking the mixing boards; now they're Gen-X musical hipsters. (In fact, Muzak has long attracted struggling musicians from the Seattle area; former employees include the founders of legendary indie label Sub Pop records, plus grunge rockers from bands like Tad and Mudhoney.) **********But despite this new approach, Muzak still relies upon a high-tech, highly orchestrated system of design and distribution.  The process begins with Muzak's 18 ''audio architects,'' who oversee the creation and selection of more than a million songs in Muzak's database. These songs fall into two basic categories: foreground and background. **********The elements of foreground music, which makes up the vast majority of Muzak's catalogue, are pop songs in their original form. With 60 channels available to Muzak subscribers, the company wants to offer a varied mix of styles; songs are chosen accordingly. Instrumental background music, also known as environmental music, is what people most associate with the company, though it's only a small portion of Muzak's services. Audio architects research sources like Billboard magazine and MTV, choosing songs that will be re-recorded instrumentally. This recording process, however, is proprietary. Declining to describe it, Mr. Collis said, ''That'd be like giving the recipe of Coke.'' **********WHILE Muzak no longer talks about  ''stimulus progression,'' it still uses ''quantum modulation,'' the company's term for how songs are classified in its database. After a song is commissioned in its original form or transformed into environmental music, it is evaluated by an audio architect. **********The architect rates the song in 45 detailed categories: the mood of the music; its instrumentation; its color (dark or light), and whether it is by a male or female vocalist. Once analyzed, the songs are assigned what the company calls ''quantum modulation'' figures and stored in the database for future retrieval. **********Every day, audio architects assemble 24-hour playlists, ranging from country to pop hits, for 60 broadcast channels. Songs are selected, Mr. Collis said, to provide the necessary blend and balance of stimulation throughout the day. ''We want to create an atmosphere that is dynamic and constantly changing,'' Mr. Collis said. ''We don't want to be boring.'' **********With the database updated, Muzak representatives meet with prospective clients to create an ''audio image'' -- a musical personality. They examine the client's marketing goals, mission statement and products, then suggest an appropriate Muzak program. A shoe store in a rural area needs to keep kids mellow; maybe the country channel might be appropriate. An urban sneaker store wants to enhance the customer experience; how about Muzak's channel with Puff Daddy songs? **********Maybe someone wants Puff Daddy and Shania Twain. No problem. A customized channel can be tailor-made. Fulfilling the vision of General Squier's Wired Radio, the  music is then sent by modem from the Seattle headquarters to satellite uplink stations in Cheyenne, Wyo., and Raleigh, N.C. Subscribers receive the transmissions via 18-inch dishes on their roofs. Muzak also provides compact disks if clients would rather program sounds on their own. **********The company's current customer base of a quarter of a million businesses compares with 125,000 subscribers in 1978. And its earnings have risen to $50.5 million for 1997, from $26.7 million in 1989, according to company figures. **********Aside from smaller background music companies in local markets, Muzak dominates the industry. While some businesses choose to use for background music something like, say, an easy listening station, Muzak says that the frequent commercial breaks are a downside to such practices.  According to Lauren Hower, manager of public relations at Muzak, the problem for the company is when offices or retail stores prefer to work without any music at all.  ''Our biggest competition is silence,'' she said. **********These days, listeners might be hard pressed to find ''You Light Up My Life'' wafting through elevator shafts. In the 1940's, Muzak was pumped into elevators to soothe fearful riders. Those days, as Mr. Collis is quick to point out, are long gone. Elevator music, he said, ''is just an urban myth.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/01/business/venator-settles-case-with-sec.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-07-01", "snippet": "Venator Group Inc, formerly Woolworth Corp, and four former executives agree to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges they falsified earnings in fiscal 1993; Venator, E Ronald Gamble and Laura T Kirsner agree to be subject to stiffer s...", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venator Settles Case With S.E.C.", "print_headline": "Venator Settles Case With S.E.C.", "body_text": " **********Venator Group Inc., the former Woolworth Corporation, and four of its former executives have agreed to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they had falsified earnings in the 1993 fiscal year. **********The New York-based Venator, which took its new name in June, agreed to be subject to stiffer sanctions if it commits similar violations in the future. **********The four executives sanctioned worked for Woolworth and two of its subsidiaries. **********Charles T.

Moreover, sales slowed for I.B.M.'s most powerful mainframe computers, the System 390, as customers delayed purchases in anticipation of an improved model that will be available in August. I.B.M. had hoped that customers would buy its older mainframe model and then upgrade later, but fewer than expected decided to take this more complex route. **********Sales of personal computers fell by more than 25 percent from a year ago, as the company tried to reduce the glut of PC's in the inventory of its dealers. I.B.M., like its competitors, has offered buyers various financial incentives. **********In total, I.B.M.'s sales to dealers were flat in terms of the number of units, but the dealers' sales of their I.B.M. inventory increased by 25 percent, said Douglas L.

As a result, he said, total PC inventory in the United States fell by four weeks' supply, although he declined to quantify the supply on hand. **********I.B.M. is trying to streamline the distribution of its personal computers by having many of them assembled at its distributors and dealers. As a result, Mr. Maine said he expected the company's PC business to improve in the second half of the year. **********I.B.M. was also hit by the declining prices of D-RAM memory chips, the type most commonly used in personal computers. Although this is a small part of I.B.M.'s semiconductor business, the 70 percent price decline was big enough to cause some pain. **********In addition, the company has faced slow sales of its Unix and Windows NT servers, computers that store files for a corporate network or for Internet sites. The company attributed these shortfalls to mismanaged marketing. **********The strong dollar continued to drag I.B.M.'s earnings because so much of its business is outside the United States. The company said that currency conversion shaved 4 percent off its revenues and 13 cents off its earnings per share. **********''Currency remains an issue for the second half, mainly because of the yen,'' Mr. Maine said in a conference call with analysts. **********The gem in I.B.M.'s business line was again the global services business, which operates computer systems and provides consulting for businesses.

He did not specify how many copies of the book the army would receive for this sum of about $125,000, but pressed on to announce payments from the inspector-general of police, and from the air force, the military governor of the northern Kaduna state and, not least, the Kaduna Polo Club. **********''As for the head of state,'' the speaker said, referring to Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's recently installed military ruler, ''we will not, out of respect, announce the size of his contribution.'' In all, more than $1 million was raised. **********The book, published by a Kaduna company, is a biography of Gen. Hassan U. Katsina, a former military governor of the northern region of Nigeria. But that was scarcely the point. For this was clearly a show of force by the northern Muslim elite of military officers, traditional rulers or emirs, and businessmen whose coalition has retained control of Nigeria for two decades. **********''General Abubakar has said the military Government will no longer fund political parties, but he said nothing about funding a book,'' a Western diplomat in the stadium said. ''What you have here is a political project built around a book.'' **********The precise form of that project is as yet unclear, but it seems certain to involve the formation of a northern, conservative political party, close to the armed forces. The man described as the ''chief launcher'' of the book was Aminu Dantata, the director of a powerful northern group of companies, and the ''chief sponsor'' was the former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. **********Among the others present were other former northern military rulers, including Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari -- who seized power in 1983 and was deposed by General Babangida in a coup in 1985, and Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who seized power in 1966 and ceded it in a coup in 1975. **********It is from this coalition, often referred to as ''the Kaduna mafia,'' that southern Nigerians are determined to wrest power in presidential elections now set for next year. **********They thought they had done so in the 1993 presidential election, with the apparent victory of the late Moshood K. O. Abiola, a man of the Yoruba people of the south. But General Babangida annulled the vote, sharpening the north-south divide that has plagued Nigeria since independence in 1960. Mr. Abiola died in detention this month. **********The area known as northern Nigeria, but embracing much of the center of the country, is ethnically mixed. But it has been largely united by its Hausa language, its overwhelmingly Muslim character, and its fear of ceding political control to the mainly Christian south. It is in the south that economic and commercial power -- essentially the country's oil -- are concentrated. **********Since taking office last month, after the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha, General Abubakar has been at pains not to fan these divisions. He has appointed Yoruba officers to the key military posts, and he has promised to hand power to a civilian on May 29 next year. **********Although he was billed as the star speaker in the stadium, General Abubakar did not attend, apparently out of concern that he might polarize the country further by identifying too closely with the northern military elite from which he has emerged. But his financial contribution made his sympathies clear enough. **********''What you have here is a group of conservative people who regard power as their heritage,'' said Bashir Ikara, a Kaduna-based political scientist. ''But the fact is that ordinary northerners have nothing to show for this long domination and are simply clamoring, like the rest of the country, for honest government.'' **********In many ways, the domination by a northern elite of military men and the emirs appears to have perpetuated elements of the old colonial system. Kaduna, home to Nigeria's military academy, was founded by Frederick Lugard, the British governor general who created Nigeria in 1914 and who favored the north because it was less unruly and more conservative than the south. **********''The bastions of northern society joined forces with the British to plunder our resources,'' Mr. Ikara said. ''Then the Nigerian armed forces replaced British soldiers. But elements of the system -- and the plundering -- have continued.'' **********Lord Lugard once described the people of the southern city of Lagos as ''the most seditious and disloyal, the most purely prompted by self-seeking money motives of any people I have met.'' In Kaduna, the regional assembly meets in a building still known as ''Lugard House,'' and the Polo Club, Nigeria's best, and the Rugby Club are situated on Waff Road -- named after Britain's former West African Frontier Force. **********Many Yoruba seem determined to overcome this legacy, referring in Lagos newspapers to the ''internal colonialism'' to which they see themselves subjugated. But, as the turnout at the meeting in Kaduna showed, the battle to shift Nigeria's political gravity promises to be a bitter one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/10/technology/news-watch-perhaps-we-should-be-amazed-that-it-can-surf-the-web-at-all.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1998-12-10", "snippet": "Newest version of 3Com's popular Palm Pilot has been criticized for offering only limited Web access; 3Com's Joe Sipher says company concluded it would be too costly and unwieldy to offer full Web access on its personal digital assistant (S)", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Perhaps We Should Be Amazed That It Can Surf the Web at All", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Perhaps We Should Be Amazed That It Can Surf the Web at All", "body_text": " **********Since 3Com announced its newest version of the popular Palm Pilot, the Palm VII, it has been criticized by some users for offering only limited Web access.

A few times they lunched on a private yacht docked in the bay. There were thick steaks and fine wines. **********Eventually, a shadowy deal was put on the table. Dr. Afshar would arrange delivery of American-made jets and military parts, including electronics to guide antiaircraft missiles. The destination for the parts was Iran, and the suggested payment was a large shipment of heroin, according to a fax sent from Iran to Mr. Akrami that outlined the arrangement. **********The deal never came off. ''Dr. Afshar'' was an undercover agent for the United States Government posing as an arms dealer bent on evading the American embargo against Iran. **********Mr. Akrami and an associate were arrested in Vancouver this week and are being held pending extradition to the United States. They face charges of conspiring to smuggle sophisticated military parts to Iran in violation of the United States embargo. **********A joint investigation by The New York Times and CBS News has found that this is not an isolated case. A significant portion of the American-made weapons and parts that Iran buys illicitly move through Canada, taking advantage of regulatory loopholes and the Canadian Government's decision not to support the American embargo. **********The result, say American officials and the Iranians involved, is a steady flow of American-made military parts across the border into Canada and on to Iran. ''Sanctions against Iran make no sense because they get everything they want through other countries,'' Mr. Akrami said in an interview here before his arrest. **********According to an indictment returned this week by a grand jury in San Francisco, Mr. Akrami, 60, told undercover agents the Iranian Government wanted to buy as many klystron tubes -- the heart of missile guidance systems -- as he could find. **********''There is a significant amount of circumvention of our sanctions through Canada,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, an Under Secretary of the Treasury, who is awaiting confirmation as the new head of the Customs Service. ''Because of the relaxed border situation that we have with Canada, the potential for abuse there is greater than perhaps with other allies.'' **********Among the Iranian arms deals involving Canada are these: ***********A Long Island man was arrested in February by United States Customs agents as he tried to deliver engines and parts for F-14 Tomcat fighters to Iran; some of the items were to be routed through Canada. He is awaiting trial. ***********A Canadian businessman was indicted in Washington, D.C., last year on 27 counts of shipping embargoed aviation parts to Iran by way of Canada and then Germany. He is currently a fugitive. ***********In Miami in 1994, an Irish businessman pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to send military night-vision goggles to Iran by way of Canada. **********And Iran is not the only destination for embargoed American military equipment from Canada. **********Several Americans and Canadians were arrested last August and charged with attempting to sell to Iraq 35 American-made military helicopters that Canada had declared surplus. The buyers had asked that some helicopters be outfitted with chemical-spraying equipment. Two Canadians have already pleaded guilty; the other defendants are awaiting trial. **********Last fall a Toronto businessman pleaded guilty to selling $6 million worth of jet parts to Libya, including some that could have military uses. **********''I'll be honest with you: Canada does not pretend that it is enforcing a U.S. embargo,'' said Lynda E. Watson, director of the export controls division in the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. While Canada tries to make sure it is not used as a decoy to get around American export restrictions, she explained, its efforts are limited. **********''It's not our embargo,'' she said, ''and it's not our job to enforce a U.S. embargo.'' **********The Middleman **********From Army Doctor To Refugee **********There are many unanswered questions about Mr. Akrami: Precisely on whose behalf was he shopping for parts? What did the Iranian Government knew about his activities? **********And while American agents were luring him into their sting, Canadian intelligence agents were using him as their informant. **********Mr. Akrami said in an interview before his arrest that he was merely a purchasing agent for Iran. ''I cannot stop them to fax me what they want,'' he said, ''but it doesn't mean I can do something or I want to do something.'' **********Mr. Akrami's lawyer, Irvine E. Epstein, said his client had exaggerated the importance of his contacts in Iran and expected Dr. Afshar to arrange the necessary export permits if the deals went through. **********''He's absolutely adamant that he has not committed any crimes in Canada or the United States,'' Mr. Epstein said of his client. ''If anything, what we have is perhaps some overzealous undercover agents trying to make something out of nothing.'' **********Before coming to Canada, Mr. Akrami said, he was a colonel in the Iranian Army and a cardiac surgeon in contact with many of Iran's most powerful people. He boasted to friends that he had once treated the Ayatollah Khomeini. **********Mr. Akrami said he had received his medical degrees in Germany and returned to Iran just a year before the 1979 revolution. His foreign training made him suspect in the turmoil of fundamentalist, post-revolution Iran. He was imprisoned but was allowed to see patients, he said. **********Soon after being freed from prison, Mr. Akrami married an Iranian woman with family in Vancouver. In 1991 he emigrated to Canada, where he quickly fit into Vancouver's substantial Iranian refugee community. **********''I'm connected to everybody,'' he said during the interview at his office. **********He does not practice medicine in Canada but gained notoriety when his mother-in-law won a divorce settlement that was the equivalent of $12 million, one of the largest in Canadian history. He helped her invest the money in various ventures, and made no secret of his intention to do business with Iran. **********In the interviews, he said he helped arrange for the delivery of two shiploads of American chemicals to Iran about four years ago, which he believed did not violate terms of the embargo. He also said he regularly received faxed messages from Iran requesting help in purchasing everything from Braille typewriters and spare parts for jumbo jets to a fleet of used civilian aircraft. **********People close to the investigation said he once told undercover agents, ''Canada is Iran's free-trade zone.'' **********The United States first imposed economic sanctions on Iran after the hostage crisis in 1979. In 1995, after Iran was linked to terrorist attacks, a total ban was imposed on all American trade with the country. Before then, certain items, including some chemicals, could be exported from the United States. **********The Introductions **********Linking Heroin To Fighter Jets **********Mr. Akrami might not have come to the attention of American authorities if not for another Iranian immigrant to Canada who was arrested by drug agents in San Francisco in 1994 and charged with a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of heroin. **********Prosecutors in San Francisco had substantial evidence against the man, Abrahim Hamidi. But after he developed medical problems, they let him return to his home in Langley, a Vancouver suburb where he lived in a modest house and grew Iranian sour plums in the backyard. **********Shortly after his return to Canada, Mr. Hamidi held a dinner at his home and invited a young Iranian friend, Mohsen Lessan, and Mr. Akrami, who said he was looking for new business opportunities. **********But this was apparently more than a social engagement. According to officials familiar with the investigation, Mr. Hamidi was cooperating with American agents who wanted to broaden their investigation into the Iranian heroin connection. The charges against Mr. Hamidi in California were dismissed in April 1996, but within a few days he was arrested on a similar drug charge in Canada. In an unusual move, the records in that case were sealed, and it is not possible to learn its outcome. **********Mr. Lessan, now a 30-year-old real estate salesman in Vancouver, said in an interview that he and Mr. Akrami had flown to San Francisco and met the man they knew as Dr. Afshar. They lunched in grand style on a yacht they believed was his. They discussed the purchase of up to 30 used jets for Iran, as well as parts and other items. **********Mr. Lessan said he felt he was in over his head. While Mr. Akrami returned to San Francisco at least twice, Mr. Lessan never again met Dr. Afshar. He was arrested this week along with Mr. Akrami and is being held pending extradition to San Francisco, where a United States Attorney, Michael J. Yamaguchi, plans to prosecute him and Mr. Akrami on the smuggling conspiracy charges. **********Mr. Lessan's lawyer, Jamie Paez, has refused to comment. **********The End of the Deal **********A Disputed Fax, An Angry Ex-Wife **********In his first interview with The New York Times and CBS, Mr. Akrami denied knowing Mr. Hamidi. But at a subsequent talk in his high-rise apartment, he admitted that he had gone to Mr. Hamidi's house, but only because his wife liked the sour plums that Mr. Hamidi grew. **********Mr. Hamidi did not respond to several phone calls or visits to his home. **********Mr. Akrami eventually admitted he had discussed several deals with ''Dr. Afshar,'' adding, ''Ninety-nine percent of the discussion was about planes.'' **********But he said one fax he received from his contact in Iran -- a man known as Sultanipour whom American officials have linked to the Iranian Government -- requested sophisticated military parts, including the American-made klystron tubes used in missile guidance systems. **********At the meetings in San Francisco, which were monitored by United States agents, Mr. Akrami openly discussed military parts and displayed a detailed knowledge of how they worked. Once, he even commented that the suitcase-sized klystron tube the agents had brought was a slightly different color than those he had seen before. **********During this period, officials said, Mr. Akrami also met regularly with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada's spy agency, which sometimes uses recent immigrants to gather information. He insists he never told them about the San Francisco meetings. **********Mr. Akrami acknowledged there were other faxes as well, including one that mentioned paying for the parts with a ''shipload of heroin.'' But he insisted that although he presented the faxed letter to Dr. Afshar, he never had any intention of actually going through with the deal. **********''This was nonsense,'' said Mr. Akrami. ''How can I have drugs to offer to someone for something like that?'' **********After repeated contact and telephone conversations with the undercover agents, Mr. Akrami abruptly backed away from the deal last summer. He said things had changed because of the tightened American embargo and because of the more moderate Government that had come to power in Iran's elections. But there appeared to be another reason: his recently divorced wife, who had some of the faxes from Iran, was threatening to expose him. **********He said his former wife had shown the faxes to authorities in an attempt to discredit him. People close to the investigation confirmed that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, a local prosecutor and a member of Parliament had talked to the woman. **********The Loophole **********An 'Exception' For a Neighbor **********Although Mr. Akrami is not charged with actually shipping any embargoed parts to Iran, recent incidents indicate that plenty of American military goods leave Canada's shores, largely because of ''the Canada exemption.'' **********For decades it has been policy of both Canada and the United States that Canada would purchase major arms systems from the United States instead of developing its own military industry. For this reason, such goods being shipped to Canada are exempt from the licensing requirements that apply to every other country. **********''Since we don't issue a license here, there's no trail to follow,'' said John Hensley, the former head of enforcement for the United States Customs Service.

In background and political approach, Mr. D'Alema resembles the Socialist Prime Minister of France, Lionel Jospin, and Gerhard Schroder, the German Chancellor-elect. Like them, he will face the challenge of marrying social democratic aspirations with the austerity measures already written into a unified European economic system. **********''I feel the weight of conflicts and expectations,'' Mr. D'Alema said after accepting the mandate. ''And I will try to do what I can do to lessen the conflicts and to not betray the expectations.'' **********Mr. D'Alema was also referring to the narrow political shoals he has been maneuvering in his search for a majority. The leader of Democrats of the Left, a party he helped form out of the embers of the Italian Communist party after the fall of the Soviet Union, said he thought he could count on the support of some Communists and also on a small center-right party led by Francesco Cossiga. **********If Mr. D'Alema and Mr. Cossiga reach agreement, it would put Mr. D'Alema in the position of leading a center-left coalition with more centrist votes in it than his more moderate predecessor. Mr. D'Alema explained his entente cordiale with Mr. Cossiga, a former Christian Democrat and President of Italy, this way: ''President Cossiga is telling our country that the cold war is over and that the men and ideas that openly fought for many years can also collaborate.'' **********Opposition leaders, including Silvio Berlusconi, the media tycoon and former conservative Prime Minister, were outraged by Mr. Cossiga's defection, calling it a fraud. **********Mr. D'Alema is counting on another fallout from the end of the cold war: the split among the Communists that occurred after hard-liners withdrew their support from Mr. Prodi. **********Mr. Prodi's coalition relied on Communist Refounding, the party that remained after leaders like Mr. D'Alema became ex-Communists and formed new, non-Marxist factions. The general secretary of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, refused to accept the 1999 budget. That drove Armando Cossutta, president of Communist Refounding, to quit and form his own party, unwilling to be associated with the Communists who caused the leftist Government to collapse. Mr. D'Alema made it clear he was not planning to horse-trade to win Mr. Bertinotti back into the fold. **********''I turn to him and say that his request that we redraft the budget is mistaken.

As in many countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia that shook off the Soviet empire, euphoria has given way to bitter truths and not a little disillusionment. **********It is telling that the first thing everyone says about Mr. Zorig is that he was honest. Equally telling, as a sign of the blend of sparse fact and plentiful fiction that characterizes many post-Communist societies, the fantastic theories being bruited about are seen as entirely plausible. **********In recent months Mr. Zorig served as Minister of Infrastructure, overseeing multimillion-dollar construction contracts. In a painful interview on Thursday his widow, Bulgan, who was tied up in the bathroom of their home as her husband was stabbed to death, said he had told her of being offered bribes -- of $5,000 and $50,000, among others. **********''Of course he refused,'' said Ms. Bulgan, bursting into tears. ''If he had taken these bribes, perhaps he would be alive today.'' **********Others wonder whether he was killed because, if he had become Prime Minister, he might have uncovered cronyism in the country's sell-off of state industries, or exposed misuse of foreign aid. Or was it the Russian mafia -- a favorite suspect for evils here -- fearing that he would interfere with lucrative business interests? **********Of course it might have been a simple robbery gone bad, and the timing a bizarre coincidence. But nobody in this country of 2.4 million people seems to believe that. **********Politicians were clearly shaken. **********''Why did this happen now, just as we were beginning to unify our coalition?'' asked Delgermaa, a 39-year-old former law professor who is a member of Parliament. ''This was not a coincidence,'' she said. Like many Mongolians, Ms. Delgermaa uses one name. **********One of the country's richest capitalists, Jargalsaikhan, spoke out about Mr. Zorig's killing this week. ''He was an honest, principled and educated person,'' he told a local newspaper. ''These qualities of his were not liked by some people.'' **********''Lately there are a lot of disputes about how to divide the pie, different cases involving money and financial deceit,'' added Mr. Jargalsaikhan, director of the giant Buyan Company, which trades in cashmere. **********For the last three months the Government has been hobbled by an impasse between the Democratic Coalition and the President. The coalition controls Parliament, and the President is from the opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the former Communists, who now call themselves social democrats. **********Coalition members had helped vote down two of their own Prime Ministers, in the most recent case largely because of an abortive effort to merge a large state bank with a private one. The merger, accomplished and then reversed, has been denounced as poorly conceived -- and, the opposition asserts, pursued in an illegal and corrupt manner. **********Under the Constitution, the President must be consulted before Parliament votes on a new prime minister. The President, Natsagiyn Bagabandi, has repeatedly turned down candidates, calling them unqualified. Finally, on Oct. 2, the coalition factions found common ground, agreeing to nominate Mr. Zorig. The President said he had been ready to approve the nomination. **********That night, a masked man and woman entered the couple's modest apartment in one of the monotonous blocks in central Ulaan Baatar, tied up Ms. Bulgan and ambushed Mr. Zorig at the door, stabbing him 16 times. Ms. Bulgan said her husband had not indicated any suspicions of danger. **********In a land where wrestling is the national sport and Genghis Khan the revered ancestor, Mr. Zorig was a gentle hero. Although his grandfather had been killed decades earlier by Stalin's henchmen, in the 1980's Mr. Zorig, like many Mongolian intellectuals, attended a university in Moscow, studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy. He returned to teach Marxism at a university in Ulaan Baatar, but his thoughts had turned to Western ideals. **********At the end of 1989, as democratic movements coursed through the Soviet empire, Mr. Zorig was one of 13 men who began agitating for Mongolia's freedom. In early 1990, as demonstrations blossomed in Ulaan Baatar's giant central square, he emerged as the most articulate and respected leader. **********He was not so much an eloquent orator, friends say, as a man of wise counsel and a quietly powerful voice of conciliation. **********On one tense day in April 1990, tens of thousands of demonstrators were pressing toward soldiers in front of the Government House. When Mr. Zorig climbed onto friends' shoulders and appealed for calm, witnesses recall, the entire crowd sat down to show their support for peaceful talks. The Communists agreed to write a new, democratic constitution. **********In the country's first real elections, in 1992, the former Communists won handily. But the task of beginning to build a market economy took a toll, with homeless children taking up residence in Ulaan Baatar's sewers, rampant inflation and a growing disparity in incomes. In 1996, to its own astonishment, the coalition of new democratic parties found itself voted into office. **********With the support of an array of international aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations, the youthful leaders vowed to speed up privatization. They also found themselves haggling over Cabinet posts and the management of complex financial transactions. **********While the corruption here does not appear to have reached the rapacious heights of Russia and some other places, it has stirred resentment in a nation with a strong egalitarian tradition. **********''This is a very small country,'' said Ms. Hulan, the legislator. ''People have eyes and ears, they can see how much their leaders are spending, and how much they earn in their public jobs.'' **********She added, ''We entertained naive thoughts that Mongolia could escape the pitfalls of all the other post-Communist countries that are now submerged in corruption and racketeering.'' **********A small group including Ms. Huran has proposed new laws to require that legislators disclose their total earnings and campaign donations, and that records of Government financial transactions be made public. **********This year, just as Mongolia seemed to be turning the corner economically, the country was battered by plummeting global prices of copper and cashmere, its main sources of revenue and foreign exchange. **********Between the economic woes and public impatience with the Government's performance, most politicians here predict that the former Communists will regain power in the next general election, in 2000. **********In the meantime, Mongolians -- an exceptionally literate and well-informed people -- are dismayed by the stalemate. In the warmth of his traditional tent-like dwelling, known as a ger, Demberelmolom expressed his exasperation by reciting a Mongolian saying: ''If the people up high can't stand on their feet, the people down below can't find a seat.'' **********Mr. Demberelmolom and his wife tend monastery ruins in a mountain valley south of Ulaan Baatar. Their theory about Mr. Zorig's murder?

The offer also includes a promise to invest about $2.2 billion in Rolls-Royce factories and to quintuple its capacity to 10,000 cars a year from 2,000. **********Four weeks ago, after an auction in which BMW and Volkswagen offered rival bids to the manufacturer of Silver Shadows and Bentleys, Vickers announced that BMW had won with an offer of nearly $600 million for Rolls-Royce alone. BMW said it would triple capacity to 6,000 cars a year over the next several years. **********Under that agreement, Vickers pledged to negotiate exclusively with BMW over the next 30 days to reach a binding contract. That 30-day period ends next Thursday, and Volkswagen has let it be known for weeks that it was ready to fire back with a better offer. **********The intensity of the competition has astonished many experts. While the Rolls-Royce name has unparalleled allure as a synonym for luxury worthy of kings and rock stars, it remains a tiny company in the automobile industry and nearly went bankrupt more than a decade ago. **********But European car manufacturers are now in a fierce rivalry to expand into the market of super-luxury cars, automobiles with price tags of $200,000 or more. **********Mercedes-Benz is expected to launch production of a new sedan known as the Maybach, which is intended to compete with Rolls-Royce. BMW, which produces cars that sell for $50,000 and up, wants to move into the highest realm of the market and to expand it. BMW has said it would introduce two new lines of Rolls-Royce, which are expected to fall somewhere between top-of-the-line BMW's and Rolls-Royce's current line of cars. **********Volkswagen, though it originally became famous for economy cars like the Beetle, owns Audi and has steadily pushed into the ranks of more expensive and potentially more profitable cars. It recently unveiled a prototype for a high-performance sports car that would compete with the likes of Ferrari and Porsche. **********It remains unclear whether a more generous offer from Volkswagen can derail the agreement with BMW. Although BMW is not believed to have increased its original offer, despite clear signs that Volkswagen would make another offer, BMW has other advantages. **********The most important is that BMW already supplies engines to Rolls-Royce, which uses them in its newly introduced Silver Seraph. When Volkswagen hinted last month that it would sweeten its offer after the auction had closed, BMW executives warned that they would stop supplying engines if their deal fell through."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/04/business/south-korea-announces-plans-for-privatizing-its-industries.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-04", "snippet": "South Korean Government announces sweeping plan to privatize wide range of industries, including giant Pohang Iron and Steel Corp (known as Posco), world's second-largest steel producer,in hope of earning as much as $8 billion by year 2000; plan c...", "word_count": 378, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korea Announces Plans For Privatizing Its Industries", "print_headline": "South Korea Announces Plans For Privatizing Its Industries", "body_text": " **********The South Korean Government announced a sweeping program today for privatizing a wide range of industries, including the giant Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation. **********The Planning and Budget Commission said the Government's shares in Posco, as the steelmaker is known, and four other state-controlled companies and their subsidiaries would go on sale immediately.

He spoke recently with Ann Brocklehurst. **********Q. You say stock markets advertise themselves as institutions that promote investment and allow businesses to grow when, in fact, that is only a minor part of what they do. How minor? **********A. I'd say it's a very, very small portion of what the market's all about. Firms fund very little of their investment programs on the markets, especially the stock market. When they do go outside for capital, they go first to banks, then the bond market, and the stock market is at the very bottom of the list. Between 1901 and 1996, net flotations of new stock amounted to just 4 percent of nonfinancial corporations' capital expenditures in the United States. **********Q. So why do companies go public? **********A. To an extent, it's an exit strategy for firms with venture capital. They see it as a way of cashing out, not a way of raising new capital. It's mostly to let the original set of venture capitalists out with a very substantial profit and to line the pockets of the management team. **********Q. But venture funds are investors themselves. Don't they reinvest? **********A. The venture funds do look for other opportunities to invest in, but the amount of venture capital is relatively small. Last year was the record year for venture-capital commitments, and it was $12 billion, so I would say in crucial qualitative terms that the actual amount is much, much smaller than anyone would probably think from a superficial reading of the papers. **********Q. What about the idea that companies that are valued highly by the stock market will tend to invest more and, as a result, grow more than less-admired competitors? **********A. The stock market and real investment will both tend to rise when interest rates are falling and profits are rising. But if you strip away the effects of things like cash flow or increase in profits or the decline in interest rates, the stock market actually offers no additional explanatory power in statistical terms. **********Q. You say that no one on Wall Street cares that orthodox economics does not explain the stock market and why historically it has outperformed other investments. Why? **********A. Well, I think for one thing it is easier not to figure out how the two relate to each other. It is very rare that you see serious kind of investigation of how these two systems \u2014 the financial and the real \u2014 work together, certainly not any investigation of a kind of the sociological role or political role of financial markets of the sort that I am interested in. **********Q. Why have so many of the people involved in the stock business \u2014 analysts, chartists, economists \u2014 performed so poorly? **********A. I think it is an impossible job. It is not possible consistently to beat the market. I have a lot of doubts about efficient-market theory as a whole, but I think that insight is 95 percent correct. It has been shown that the more actively managed a portfolio is, the lower its return is likely to be. And I think most newsletters and investment advisers do rather badly. Most professional portfolio managers do a little less well than the market averages, which isn't surprising, since they are the market, and because fees and commissions shave a bit off their returns. **********Q. You are critical of the high salaries people on Wall Street earn. Given their performance records, why do investors support those high salaries? **********A. People are not aware of it. It is not palpable. It is not like when you go to the store and see a price tag of how expensive this is. They don't realize that management fees of 1 percent for a pension fund are making a small group of people very rich. **********I think the stock market is very seductive and it charms people into believing they can get rich without having to do a lot of work or save, so they are willing to plunge in and play these games. The brokers and analysts make money this way because people are willing to pay them to get a piece of the action. **********Q. This bull market has made a lot of people quite a bit richer. **********A. This latest cycle has been a way for the shareholder class to extract immense amounts of money from the productive side. Between dividends and buybacks and takeovers, they are just getting oodles and oodles of money out of the productive sector. From 1984, when the modern era of corporate finance really got going, through the third quarter of 1997, nonfinancial firms borrowed a total of $2.06 trillion, and retired a total of $818 billion in stock. Together, these add to combined outside financing of $1.24 trillion **********On the other side of the ledger, firms paid out $1.50 trillion in interest and $1.74 trillion in dividends, for a total outflow of $3.24 trillion. The balance: $2.00 trillion in Wall Street's favor. The traffic runs mainly from the real side to the financial side and not the other way around, as people generally think. **********I think stock markets really need to be thought of more as social organizations of class consolidation rather than conduits of savings and investment as they are usually thought of. The stock market is really about arranging ownership and control, whether we are talking about one corporation buying up another or a small group of rich folks and their portfolio managers exercising control over a country's economy. **********Q. But are stockholders a small group of rich folk? Aren't they also people with pension funds invested in stocks? **********A. Even if you want to include pension assets in wealth distribution figures, it doesn't change all that much because the majority of pension assets are really claimed by fully upper- and upper-middle income people. Only 40 percent of the U.S. labor force is covered by a pension plan. It reduces the concentration figures somewhat but not all that dramatically. **********Q. How do you react to seeing the U.S. model embraced by so much of the rest of the world? **********A. There is a lot of amnesia around these things. It was less than 10 years ago that people thought that Japan was taking over the world and the U.S. was washed up. People are forgetting that Japan had a 45-year history of extremely rapid growth of a sort really unprecedented in the history of capitalism. **********The same thing is true, although not quite as dramatically, of Germany. I think Europe's current problems are in a large part the result of the Maastricht criteria, with its punishingly tight fiscal and monetary policies, and a lot of that is quite a conscious desire on the part of the European political and business elite to emulate the U.S. They want to break down all the union structures and the welfare state and all those things that stand in their way. And one of the ways of doing that is to set up a U.S.-style set of financial markets, a U.S.-style labor market. When we talk about the relative success of the U.S. versus other models, we have to define what we mean by success. The people who define success don't include 20 percent poverty rates as a criteria of failure. **********DOUG HENWOOD'S book, \"Wall Street\" is to be published in May by Verso (hardcover, $25; paperback, $17).

Even before Pakistan conducted the nuclear tests, which were in response to tests by India, the country's economy had been devastated by years of mismanagement. **********But the announcement of sanctions by the United States and some of its allies appears to have pushed Pakistan over the brink, with investors fleeing, banks collapsing, currency reserves dropping to a scant $600 million, and Government officials warning that the country could default on its national debt of more than $30 billion. **********Today's announcement came as Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, arrived in Islamabad on a trip to urge both India and Pakistan to abandon plans to deploy nuclear weapons.

The Administration has allowed the World Bank to proceed with most of its loans to India, declaring that they are for humane purposes and thus exempt from sanctions.

That amendment requires the Administration to oppose all assistance to any country that detonates a nuclear device, except food, medicine and related aid. **********The State Department spokesman, James P.

The commission is also challenging open skies deals by several nonmember states \u2014 Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. **********The countries have two months to respond, and the commission said it might take the case to the European Court if it finds the replies unsatisfactory. **********All the countries were certain to resist the commission's demands, aviation industry observers said. **********\"We entered into this agreement like other states before and after us,\" an Austrian Transport Ministry spokesman told Reuters. \"We believe it's EU-compatible \u2014 and will adhere to its contents.\" **********The commission has a mandate to negotiate foreign trade on behalf of member states, but air transportation was not originally a part of it. Two years ago, the governments did authorize the commission to open negotiations with the United States in the field of civil aviation. **********Mr. Kinnock regards the open-skies deals as impeding these negotiations, because the United States is under no pressure to deal with the commission if it can get better terms with individual governments. **********The commission contends that the agreements give U.S. carriers full access to Europe in exchange for only limited access to the American heartland. Because the United States restricts the number of airports at which foreign carriers can operate, several European airlines have circumvented the law by signing so-called code-sharing agreements with U.S. carriers. **********The commission aims to obtain full market access for EU carriers in the United States, and reciprocal ownership rights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/world/bosnia-economy-still-at-mercy-of-political-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Mike O'Connor", "pub_date": "1998-11-22", "snippet": "Bosnian political leaders are so good at resisting changes needed to revive economy that diplomats and foreign officials say their governments now face choice between providing large amounts of financial aid for years and watching country collapse...", "word_count": 1121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bosnia Economy Still at Mercy of Political Leaders", "print_headline": "Bosnia Economy Still at Mercy of Political Leaders", "body_text": " **********Bosnian political leaders are so good at resisting changes needed to revive the economy that diplomats and foreign officials say their governments now face the choice between providing large amounts of financial aid for years and watching the country collapse. **********Three years after the Dayton peace agreement, diplomats had assumed that foreign private investment would have begun to replace the $1.5 billion in annual foreign aid. But, with the ravages of war still very obvious and an economy still run by Communist-era rules, doing business in Bosnia remains so unattractive that there is very little foreign investment. **********It takes 33,000 foreign troops to keep a new war at bay, and Bosnia's various governments are held in place only with the daily prodding of  hundreds of foreign diplomats and experts. Similarly, the economy survives in large part on international aid and the money spent to support foreign organizations and tens of thousands of foreigners working here. **********''We urge, we push, we organize meetings, we threaten,'' said Didier Fau, his face contorting slightly with the frustration of being one of the top foreign officials responsible for Bosnia's economic reform. ''But we are not in charge.'' **********''Anyone with the power to change the system benefits from the way the system works now, so there is no reason for them to want change,'' said a Western diplomat, referring to the small group of politicians who control much of the economy through their control of government. **********''They think we can't afford to fail and we'll just keep paying,'' the diplomat said. ''Maybe they are right.'' **********Only three big foreign firms have ventured into Bosnia, and even their commitment is tentative. Volkswagen, which operated a large plant just outside Sarajevo that was commandeered and wrecked by the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 war, is opening a much-scaled-down operation. With some 400 workers, it will assemble the final 10 percent of the Skoda cars made at the company's plants in the Czech Republic. German diplomats said it took two years of pressure to persuade the company to return to Bosnia. Coca-Cola has a bottling venture in Bosnia, and DHL operates a courier service. But both could fold quickly if they needed to get out, businessmen said. **********Many of the other foreign business people in Bosnia seem to be motivated less by profit than emotion. **********Jean Le Roch has his office across from the marketplace where a mortar shell killed 68 people on Feb. 5, 1994. Mr. Le Roch was a French Army officer with the United Nations in Bosnia then. Now his business is to advise European companies interested in setting up here. **********''So far, in three years, two companies that I work with, small companies, have started up,'' he said. The problem, he said, is that foreign investors find it is too hard to make a profit. **********''In 1996 we had 160 delegations come from important businesses who wanted to start something here,'' Mr. Le Roch said. ''Last year 97 delegations, this year we won't even reach 25. This country now has a bad reputation.'' **********''The leaders, on all sides, have learned the words to use,'' he said. ''Free enterprise, Western style, market economy, dynamic, efficient. They say these things with great passion. But that is only superficial, nothing has changed from when this was a Communist country.'' **********Most people in business or government here grew up in Communist Yugoslavia's unique economic system, which mixed Marxist planning with alleged self-management of enterprises and was heavily subsidized by the West, which wanted to keep the country out of the Soviet orbit. **********Failing state-run companies in Bosnia received loans from a state-run bank that kept them going and were never meant to be repaid. The economy was largely a mirage, but its managers mouthed the jargon and insisted that they practiced an enlightened mix of Communism and capitalism. **********In similar fashion, today's Bosnian politicians refuse to provide the kind of business environment that most large foreign investors demand. Foreign economists working to try to open the Bosnian economy say there is often favoritism in the way taxes and laws are applied, so that a business can find itself penalized while a competitor with a friend in the Government gets help. They say the lack of a commercial bank system or privatization also keeps investors away. **********Instead of helping investors, diplomats and foreign economists say, Bosnian political leaders allow, and often profit from, corruption, tax evasion, and regulations so burdensome that companies often must bribe officials, or break the law. **********''There is no senior leader from any group who says it is time to move off a welfare economy to a productive economy,'' said the American Ambassador to Bosnia, Richard D. Kauzlarich. ''Privatization has been delayed, private initiative has been discouraged. People here need to realize that their future will not be financed by the international community.'' **********''There is no shortage of other places for investors to go in this region,'' said Saumya Mitra, deputy director of the World Bank in Bosnia. **********Even with American Government experts in place in Bosnian banking  regulatory agencies, Bosnian officials managed secretly to sell off seven Government-owned banks, probably illegally, foreign experts say. **********Many diplomats confess that they doubt the problems can be fixed before their governments give up hope. For all the foreign aid and technical assistance received, and promises of reform made by Bosnian officials, most workers still do not have jobs and only 30 percent of the prewar industrial capacity has been revived. **********Some countries are starting programs they hope will foster free enterprise. The European Union is shifting about $350 million from programs to help refugees return to programs intended to help develop the private sector, a spokesman said. **********The United States has a $278 million loan program for Bosnian businesses, part of a $766 million reconstruction project. In addition, the Pentagon estimates that it is costing about $2 billion a year to keep American forces here. **********The United States pays $25 million a year for programs giving technical advice on new laws and regulations intended to open the economy to investment. These allowed the Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Seadeta Ceric, to say: ''Our economy is now very open and very friendly for foreign investments. No one should have any problems here.'' **********Not so, said an American investor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Every permit is a nightmare,'' the investor said. ''New regulations appear overnight and get applied retroactively. Every official has his hand out. I'm making money, but it's all off the books so the Government can't find it, because they would take it.'' **********Mr. Le Roch, who now -- in despair -- counsels foreign investors to look elsewhere, said: ''I will survive. The people here, they will survive, somehow.

''Pepsi has made it clear that they are managing the business to hit a midteens earnings-per-share growth.

''Then everyone got all excited about it again,'' she said. On Feb. 3, shares of Pepsico tumbled after the company warned of increased expenses associated with expanding its soft drink and snack food business and moderate growth in the coming year. **********In the first quarter, Pepsico earned $377 million, or 24 cents a fully diluted share, down 11.7 percent from $427 million, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. But the 1997 quarter included $109 million in profit from its Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell restaurants, which it subsequently spun off. **********Wall Street was expecting earnings of 23 cents a share in the most recent quarter, according to a survey of analysts by the First Call Corporation, an investment research firm. **********Net sales in the quarter grew 3 percent, from $4.21 billion to $4.35 billion. Sales of Pepsi-Cola in the United States, where the brand constitutes 45 percent of the company's volume, have been flat. Its archrival, the Coca-Cola Company, meanwhile, has reported a 5 percent gain in the first quarter. **********''It's critical to get brand Pepsi to grow,'' Mr. Conway of Morgan Stanely said. ''Classic Coke is growing, but brand Pepsi is not.'' **********International soft drink sales are intensely competitive, and in the first quarter, Pepsi's declined 14 percent, the company reported. Operating profit in international soft drink sales fell 18 percent, which was an improvement over the 27 percent decline in the first quarter of last year. **********Ms. Solomon, the Salomon analyst, said she was concerned that international snack food sales may not be strong. ''It's really important that that's a strong growth engine for them,'' she said, ''and on a comparable basis, the profits were flat for the quarter.'' **********Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., said it would face higher potato costs because of a poor spring crop of a particular type of potato that led the company to cut back on the production of some potato chips for two weeks earlier this month. The production problems affect its Lay's and Ruffles brands but not its new Wow line of fat-free potato chips. **********''Pepsico is on track for a solid 1998,'' the company's chairman and chief executive, Roger Enrico, said in a statement.

Bosnian Serb authorities linked to the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has been charged with war crimes, insisted that unless areas they controlled received 15 percent of the money they would block the whole deal. **********With the Bosnian Serb member of the three-person Bosnian Presidency threatening to veto the aid plan, they got what they wanted and the deal went through. It became another chunk of the increasing flow of loans and grants to the part of Bosnia where the authorities are seen as implacable opponents of Western policy. **********As the American Government throws its weight behind a new group of Bosnian Serb politicians it says are more cooperative, Western Governments are preparing to spend some $130 million on new aid projects in Bosnian Serb areas. **********Diplomats in Bosnia and human rights monitors in Washington say they fear that some of the aid will strengthen leaders who oppose Western efforts to promote peace and ethnic tolerance or, through lax auditing, make those leaders richer. **********The situation sharpens a dilemma long present in Western policy in Bosnia: the conflict between principle and practicality -- whether aid should go to hard-core nationalists, even criminals, in hopes of enticing them to become more moderate or merely as the unfortunate price of carrying out broader goals. **********Following the United States' lead, the West leapt to give financial support to Dr. Karadzic's successor, Biljana Plavsic, after she split with other nationalist politicians. American diplomats call the new Bosnian Serb president a moderate, though they acknowledge that her actions fall short of her promises to back Western efforts to carry out the peace accord that ended the Bosnian war two years ago. **********That a lot of the aid goes to authorities who routinely renege on commitments is acceptable for now, in the view of the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Brian Atwood. Money is a tool for gaining influence and encouraging political change, he said. **********''If we're too rigid on the terms we'd never move any money,'' he said. ''You do the best you can, but it does no good to be so rigid you basically don't engage.'' **********A senior American official who is helping shape policy said, ''Moral absolutism will not get us very far in Bosnia policy.'' He said that in the last few months some Bosnian Serb leaders had become less difficult to deal with because they want Western aid. **********A Town Controlled By a Few Serbs **********In this small town, Sokolac, an agricultural center in mountains dabbed with sheep herds and rustic cottages that Bosnians consider the heartland of Serbian nationalism, local leaders are pleased to have been selected for a $750,000 World Bank loan to remake the water system. **********They can't explain, though, how they met the criteria for the loan. They say the water system is not below the level needed to satisfy basic human needs or protect the health of its 12,000 customers. Nor is it insufficient to supply water for initial economic recovery. Only a leap in the town's growth would substantially tax the system. **********''We're hoping to have 30,000 people living here in a few years,'' said Mitar Odvic, the water system manager. ''Considering that, what we have now is not adequate.'' **********In Sokolac, the small group of Bosnian Serb men who control almost all government, business and daily life have defied pressure to share power or allow thousands of refugees from other ethnic groups to return home. **********In the benefits they will get from the World bank loan, and in their opposition to the peace accord, they are typical of many authorities to whom financial aid is being directed. **********Officials of Western assistance programs say money is always precisely targeted and scrupulously monitored. It is supposed to be for urgent needs, and only for areas where local authorities can be trusted to unify and stabilize the country by doing what was promised in the peace accord. **********That accord recognized a Bosnian Serb Republic and a Bosnian-Croat Federation in Bosnia. Two important elements of it that are nearly universally ignored in the Serb Republic are the arrest of war crimes suspects and the return of refugees. **********Aid That Helps The Wrong People **********But many experts say that without aid the Serb-controlled region of Bosnia they control will remain an economic wilderness. **********''Their part of the country cannot make it back with the previous level of assistance,'' said Rory O'Sullivan, head of the World Bank mission in Bosnia. ''If half of the country is dead economically, the whole country cannot survive.'' **********Criticism of the aid programs comes from the belief that much of the money is going to the worst Bosnian Serb leaders, either through oversight, or so that they will not obstruct the aid that might help moderate leaders. **********''There is always the temptation to push out money to get economic results,'' said Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for International Justice, a nonprofit organization based in Washington. ''But economic results on a corrupt foundation will fail,'' she said, ''You have to support the right people.'' **********In the United States Congress there is also concern that foreign aid money in Bosnia may not be achieving American goals as well as it should. Thirteen lawmakers wrote Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright asking her not to approve the World Bank loans. **********One of them, Senator Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat, said in a telephone interview that Congress sees little payoff for the money being spent. ''They'd better start showing results soon,'' he said. ''There's not a lot of patience around here.'' **********In the last two years, even as foreign diplomats condemned Bosnian Serb authorities for their refusal to carry out essential tenets of the 1995 peace agreement, the World Bank lent about $15 million and the European Union donated about $80 million for projects in the area those authorities controlled. The United States Agency for International Development provided $19 million in loans and grants, most of it for economic development, to the same area. **********With the formation recently of a new Serb Republic Government that foreign diplomats say will be more amenable to the peace agreement, Western officials want to distribute much more money. The United States alone expects to contribute about $5 million dollars a month. **********There are no exact figures, but estimates are that about 900,000 people live in the Serb Republic. **********New World Bank loans were approved by the United States in December. Congressional critics objected, but Secretary of State Albright issued a waiver to legislative restrictions on giving aid where authorities have not done enough to arrest suspected war criminals.  Most of the more than 50 people under indictment on charges of war crimes are thought to be living in the Serb Republic. **********Refugees Kept Out As Suspects Go Free **********World Bank officials, like officials of other Western aid programs, said their projects were approved after careful research, and with the towns ranked according to need. Even so, 15 percent of the World Bank money went to towns like Sokolac, in the eastern part of the Serb Republic, where many officials are under the sway of Dr. Karadzic, who is considered a principal barrier to peaceful reunification of the country. **********The loans had to be endorsed by the three-person Bosnian presidency, where the Bosnian Serb representative threatened to block all loans unless communities in the eastern part of the Serb Republic got a share, according to Western officials. **********''It is necessary to include a portion of the aid to the eastern Serb Republic because of the veto Karadzic has over the entire process,'' said a senior American official. **********''That's the way business gets done,'' said a State Department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. **********Foreign consultants to the World Bank who oversaw the research into which towns qualified for assistance say most of the data were collected by local officials who work for the same hard-line politicians the West is trying to marginalize. **********All the towns receiving American, World Bank or European Union money were reviewed by the office of the chief Western monitor in Bosnia to insure the aid would help only communities where there is a reasonable hope that officials may become cooperative. **********But in Sokolac, international refugee officials said not a single Muslim or Croat refugee has returned, nor did they expect local political leaders would allow any to return soon. **********In the town of Bijeljina, also to benefit from the new batch of World Bank loans, American soldiers recently detained a well-known war crimes suspect who had been living there openly. His friends say he was under the protection of local officials. **********Another Bosnian Serb-controlled town, Foca, cleared to get World Bank money, was dropped in late December after human rights groups in Washington pointed out to the State Department that officials in Foca are thought to be harboring several men indicted on charges of war crimes. **********For United States assistance in the Serb Republic in the last two years, nearly every project required a memorandum of understanding in which local authorities agreed to follow the peace accords by allowing refugees to return and arresting war crimes suspects. But, Bosnian Serb authorities have arrested no war crimes suspects. Of the 560,000 Muslims and Croats expelled by Bosnian Serbs during the war, only about 3,000 have been allowed to return, according to the United Nations. **********Senior American diplomats, including Secretary of State Albright, insist they will only support Bosnian Serb political leaders who support the peace accords. But American aid officials say they don't have the staff to monitor compliance when it comes to loans and grants. **********A senior United States aid official conceded American funds in Bosnia could easily go to companies controlled by opponents of American policy. Often, said the official, the money is disbursed without a close check on the company. **********''It's a concern,'' the official said. ''We don't have resources to look at the bona fides of every company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/20/business/media-publishing-looking-through-pulitzer-colored-glasses-disasters-crime-reign.html": {"writer_name": "Felicity Barringer", "pub_date": "1998-04-20", "snippet": "Felicity Barringer column on the kinds of journalism that win Pulitzer Prizes; finds tendency of Pulitzer judges to reward reporting of disasters and watchdog reporting that unearths corruption or abuse of power; finds few awards where business fi...", "word_count": 959, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Looking through Pulitzer-colored glasses: Disasters and crime reign supreme.", "print_headline": "MEDIA: PUBLISHING; Looking through Pulitzer-colored glasses: Disasters and crime reign supreme.", "body_text": " **********SEEN through the lens of the Pulitzer Prizes, Clark Kent is a superman. He needs no phone booths. It is not the spandex suit with the big red ''S'' that makes the man, it is the notebook, the smarts, the guts and the heart. **********Long before slogans became sound bites, journalists had developed their own verbal shorthand for what they did and why: Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Be a watchdog. Write the first rough draft of history. **********The board that gives out journalism's highest awards, named for the publisher Joseph Pulitzer, has since 1917 set out to honor extraordinary examples of reporting, capturing the spirit of these sound bites. (The letters awards, for books, drama and music, are a subject for a different sort of analysis.) The sum total of what the board has done over the last 30 years shows that the profession is more likely to honor those who worry about afflictions than anything else. **********And so to look at the journalism Pulitzers over the last three decades or so is not necessarily to look at the world the journalists have lived in. To look at the list of recent Pulitzer Prizes is to see the profession that prides itself on shrewdness, savvy and dispassionate analysis looking at itself with a downright romantic eye. **********There is, of course, a caveat. As Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive of The Associated Press, said, ''I don't know if you can draw sociological significance from the prizes, beyond the fact that in any particular case, really good people were put on a big, overwhelming story.'' **********So let it be stipulated: Pulitzer winners have done extraordinary work. But in what arenas do journalists prefer to work? **********First and foremost, arenas of affliction. Disasters and their causes and cures are the centerpiece of the Pulitzer oeuvre. Articles about the Detroit race riots, the Kent State shootings, Three Mile Island, the Challenger space shuttle explosion, the Los Angeles riots, the World Trade Center bombing and the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 have all been honored with Pulitzers. **********When reporters could do something to explain the causes of disasters or help alleviate the pain they caused, they sometimes won Pulitzer gold medals for public service for their newspapers, as The Grand Forks Herald in North Dakota did last week for coverage ''that helped hold a community together'' after last year's devastating floods. **********''We're pro-disaster,'' said Benjamin C. Bradlee, the legendary former editor of The Washington Post who now serves as a vice president of the Washington Post Company and was a member of the Pulitzer Prize board for several years. **********Comforting the afflicted leads journalists to examine prisons and mental hospitals, and four times since 1966, the board has honored work showing that someone had been falsely convicted of a crime. **********A second strong tendency has been to reward watchdogs: Newspapers win prizes for unearthing corruption, abuse of power, callousness or mismanagement in the public or not-for-profit sectors, whether among the Philadelphia police, in the municipality of Stamford, Conn., in a transit system or in an evangelical ministry. **********But what about corporations and industries? Are there some comfortable folk there who could do with some afflicting? Not many, by the Pulitzer scoreboard. More than 250 Pulitzers in journalism have been awarded since 1978. Business figures prominently in about 10. **********So, while Pulitzer Prize entries have chronicled the 1987 stock-market crash and the finagling that went on afterward, corruption in grain exporting, an attempted foreign takeover of an American tire company and the management woes of General Motors, the awards indicate that a corrupt municipal government gets more scrutiny than a corrupt brokerage house does. **********By the same yardstick, journalists do better when they examine the nuances of human disease and environmental destruction than when they tackle the workings of the economy or the rise of personal computers. **********The assumption has built-in problems for Mr. Boccardi, who has seen the process from a board's-eye view and a juror's. ''We don't sit there and deliberate and say that we ought to be encouraging stories about Glass-Steagall because it's going to be really important come the new global economy,'' he said, referring to the law separating commercial and investment banking. **********Each year's entries, he said, are measured only on their own merits. ''I've never heard anyone say, 'We went with a war story last year, let's look for something else this year,' '' he added. **********Coverage that counts as the first rough draft of history has gotten its share of awards: the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, school desegregation, the fall of Communism, the crumbling of apartheid in South Africa, the twists and turns of the Middle East all produced award-winning coverage. **********Latin America? Before this year's award for articles on drugs and corruption in Mexico, just three prizes for dispatches from the region since 1968. Africa? Three from South Africa since 1968; three more from sub-Saharan Africa, two on famine and the most recent for reporting on the rise of the Ebola virus in Zaire. **********But the political and social conflicts of the Southern Hemisphere are mostly not the stuff of Pulitzer-Prize analysis. Seen through the Pulitzer lens, they are the stuff of emotional imagery: Since 1975, more Pulitzer-winning coverage in Africa and Central America has been done by photographers than by writers. **********A simple explanation is that the phtographers drawn to Africa do superb work. Less flattering is the notion that journalists are better at making readers feel the pain of those countries than at explaining it. **********Award-winning journalism, then, is a Superman sort of thing. It fights for truth and justice. But explosions and crime are journalists' business; glaciers are for historians. **********''You have to remember,'' said Seymour Topping, the administrator of the Pulitzer board, ''very often in economics and politics there isn't  much of an opportunity to dramatize.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/business/woman-chosen-to-head-gm-s-saturn-division.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1998-12-15", "snippet": "Cynthia M Trudell is named chairwoman and president of General Motors' Saturn division, first woman to head car division at any domestic or foreign auto maker; GM, faced with shrinking small-car market and struggling to repair its once-legendary l...", "word_count": 917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Woman Chosen to Head G.M.'s Saturn Division", "print_headline": "Woman Chosen to Head G.M.'s Saturn Division", "body_text": " **********Facing a shrinking small-car market and struggling to repair its once-legendary labor relations, General Motors' Saturn division appointed an expert on sport utility vehicles and factory management today to become chairwoman and president on Jan. 1. **********The new head of Saturn, Cynthia M.

Set up in 1987 as a joint venture with Isuzu of Japan, IBC is now wholly owned by G.M., but the Frontera still resembles the Isuzu Rodeo. **********Saturn's current chairman and president, Donald W. Hudler, is retiring after 43 years with G.M. and will become the chief executive of Saturn Retail Enterprises, a separate company that G.M. is setting up with some Saturn dealers to own dealerships jointly, instead of leaving auto retailing to the dealers. **********Ms. Trudell is one of the industry's very few female executives who have spent a lot of time in factories. The industry's few female managers have tended to wind up in the personnel, legal, safety and governmental affairs divisions, often with limited opportunities to advance. **********A Canadian who earned a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of Windsor in Ontario, Ms. Trudell worked from 1981 to 1990 at G.M.'s huge transmission factory in Ypsilanti, Mich., where she served as a senior engineering supervisor, superintendent of manufacturing, manufacturing engineering manager and finally operations manager. In the early 1990's, she worked on future engine technologies and ran an engine factory and foundry in Canada. From 1995 until last year, she ran the assembly plant in Wilmington, Del., where the Saturn midsized car will be produced. **********G.M. and the Ford Motor Company currently have women running their Canadian operations, and this autumn G.M. gave two women the title of general managers of Buick and Oldsmobile, but those divisions have virtually ceased to exist as separate organizations within G.M. They long ago lost their factories, and in the autumn reorganization they were stripped of their sales and marketing operations, so the new general managers are limited to managing the brands. **********Until now, full-fledged car divisions like Saturn with their own manufacturing and marketing operations have been led only by men at auto makers in the United States and overseas, said David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan. **********Mr. Lewis, who is also a former aide to two G.M. presidents, said that the domestic auto makers had little interest in hiring or promoting women, blacks and Jews until the late 1960's. While attitudes have changed since then, resistance remains particularly strong to putting women in charge of manufacturing operations. **********Some auto executives still ''will say privately that it's a man's world and will stay that way,'' Mr. Lewis said, adding, ''They wonder whether a woman can control things.'' **********Louis R. Hughes, a G.M. executive vice president, said in an interview early this year that G.M. kept track of the number of women and minorities in a wide range of jobs and looked at these figures during every meeting on executive promotions. The auto makers have also set out strict policies against sexual harassment and they are trying to halt the industry's longtime practice of holding business lunches in strip bars. **********Criticism of the insular Detroit auto industry for not promoting women and minorities, long heard from outsiders, has recently been voiced within the industry as well. **********Automotive News, a weekly trade journal that is required reading for auto executives, accused the industry in a recent editorial of saying that women and minority executives were ''in the pipeline'' but never promoting them. ''On the diversity front, there is progress, but to see it you need to run an arthroscope down the pipeline,'' the magazine said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/21/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-04-21", "snippet": "Agriculture Department reports winter wheat crop is in good shape as it emerges from dormancy; wheat for July delivery falls 4.25 cents, to $3.0975 a bushel, on Chicago Board of Trade; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********WHEAT LOWER.

Six Sigma. **********In consultant-speak, it denotes the path to a corporate nirvana where everything -- from product design to manufacturing to billing -- proceeds without a hitch. In engineer-speak, it means no more than 3.4 defects per million widgets or procedures. **********In practice, Six Sigma is a statistical quality-control method that combines the art of the efficiency expert with the science of the computer geek. And a growing group of big no-nonsense companies like Allied Signal, Motorola and General Electric swear by it. **********''Six Sigma has galvanized our company with an intensity the likes of which I have never seen in my 40 years at G.E.,'' said John F. Welch, the chairman of General Electric. **********So fervent a proselytizer is Mr. Welch that G.E. has spent three years and more than $1 billion to convert all of its divisions to the Six Sigma faith. The GE Medical Systems unit recently introduced a $1.25 million diagnostic scanner, the first product that G.E.  designed from start to finish using Six Sigma principles. Six Sigma teamwork enabled GE Plastics to produce 1.1 billion pounds more plastics without building one new plant. Over all, Mr. Welch credits Six Sigma with raising the company's operating profit margins to 16.6 percent from 14.4 percent. **********So what exactly is this philosophy of flawlessness? First, the name. Sigma is the Greek letter that statisticians use to define a standard deviation from a bell curve. The higher the sigma, the fewer the deviations from the norm -- or, in industry parlance, the fewer the defects. At One Sigma, two-thirds of whatever is being measured falls within the curve. Two Sigma encompasses about 95 percent. At Six Sigma you are about as close to flaw free as mere mortals can get. **********No company can really achieve that kind of perfection, of course. But as with any religion, Six Sigma presents an ideal state toward which adherents  continually strive. **********''Six Sigma gets people away from thinking that 96 percent is good, to thinking that 40,000 failures per million is bad,'' said James E. Morehouse, a vice president of the consulting firm of A. T. Kearney Inc. **********Six Sigma was developed more than a decade ago at Motorola. But since then, it has been embraced by numerous corporations and is even included in courses on quality at the Harvard Business School. **********As applied in industry, Six Sigma is a rigorous statistical method of breaking a customer's requirements into tasks or steps, and setting the optimum specification for each part of the process, based on how the parts interact. **********''Six Sigma translates fuzzy customer requirements into technically measurable responses,'' said Maurice L. Berryman, a Six Sigma consultant in Dallas. **********Here is an example: Say a customer wants to be billed on the same day each month. With Six Sigma, making that happen means analyzing the interaction of everything involved in processing that customer's order. **********When and how does the sales department send through paperwork, and at what point does a difference in days, hours, even minutes, have an impact on when the bill goes out? Does it make a difference when shipping coordinates with billing? How long does mail sit in the mail room, and at what point does it matter? **********Once everything is quantified, the what-if scenarios begin: Would a stricter paperwork processing schedule in sales make mail room bottlenecks irrelevant? Would adding a person in accounting give the mail room an extra hour's leeway? **********In principle, Six Sigma is little different from the type of analysis that Frederick W. Taylor, the industrial efficiency pioneer, might have performed with stopwatch and notebook a century ago. But in Six Sigma analyses, there are thousands of permutations and combinations -- probably too many for the human mind to fathom, although easy enough for even a moderately speedy computer. Thus, modern information technology has made Six Sigma a practical way to identify the optimum configuration of most products or processes. **********''Six Sigma gets people from all over the organization to work together on improving the end product, not just their individual piece of it,'' said Frank Jones, a Six Sigma specialist at the management consulting firm Booz-Allen & Hamilton. **********Scanner Analyses Cost $50 Million **********In the case of the new GE Medical Systems product -- a superfast diagnostic scanner called the Lightspeed -- 200 people spent nearly three years and almost $50 million to run  250 separate Six Sigma analyses. While one team was checking out the reliability of measurement devices, another was figuring out which factors affect the scanner's life, while yet another was dissecting image quality into factors that could be massaged to filter out picture-blurring electronic noise. **********The Lightspeed, like many diagnostic scanners, employs computed tomography, or CT. CT scanners work by sending electromagnetic waves through the body and recording the amount of energy that comes out. Since various tissues and organs absorb energy differently -- bones absorb more than flesh, for example -- the emerging waves, in the form of light, yield a good picture of the internal landscape they have passed through. The scanners let doctors study wafer-thin cross sections of parts or all of a patient's body without making any incision. **********GE Medical Systems, which already controls 39 percent of the $1.6 billion global market for scanners, has high hopes for the Lightspeed. The new scanner captures multiple images simultaneously, requiring only 20 seconds to do full-body scans that once took three minutes -- important because patients must remain perfectly still during the scan. And unlike previous CT scanners, the Lightspeed does not need to cool down for as long as three minutes between uses. **********''The speed is breathtaking, and it ran without downtime from the start,'' said Dr. Carl Ravin, the chairman of the department of radiology at Duke Medical Center. **********The Lightspeed is not perfect, of course. But Six Sigma enabled GE Medical to anticipate which compromises doctors would accept. For example, the Lightspeed takes slightly thicker scan slices than doctors normally specify, but no one complained because the thicker slices were virtually free of electronic noise. **********''Six Sigma let us predict the amount of variability that customers will tolerate before they perceive it as a defect,'' said Marc Onetto, who oversees Six Sigma projects at Gems, as GE Medical Systems is commonly known. **********The Problem Of Human Error **********Of course Six Sigma itself is not perfect, either, since it cannot compensate for human error. Take what happened when Gems tinkered with the computer that translates the data the scanner collects into images an operator can read. **********CT scanners generate a lot of heat, and the heat often caused the printed circuit boards to overload. A Six Sigma team figured out that by perforating the metal box that holds the boards, they could dissipate the heat. They were right -- except that they forgot to check what other impact that change might have. **********Gems started sending out scanners with perforated computer boxes. The holes compromised the structural integrity of the metal, the metal warped outward and the circuit boards loosened -- causing as many failures as the heat had. **********Gems technicians spotted the problem during field tests, and the company corrected it by reinforcing the metal before any scanner was running at a hospital or a clinic. But the mistake taught Gems an important lesson about Six Sigma. **********''You must take it step by step,'' said Charles H. Young, a Gems spokesman who has been steeped in the process. ''You get into trouble if you compromise the rigor of the process. You can't skip steps and jump to premature conclusions.'' **********Customer Demand Drives Project **********The Lightspeed project started, as so many new products do, with customers clamoring for more, better, faster. **********By late 1995, Gems knew that Siemens, Toshiba and other competitors were working on faster scanners. The company also knew it could  probably get its own faster version ready, approved by the Food and Drug Administration and on the market before the 1998 Radiology Society of North America show, the annual December trade exposition at which the medical equipment industry displays its latest wares. But readying a scanner as radically different as the Lightspeed was an iffier proposition. **********''Going for that quantum leap in technology in that time frame was one of the toughest decisions of my career,'' said Vivek Paul, the general manager of the CT business at Gems. ''We shifted development resources from existing products, and that left us very vulnerable if Lightspeed couldn't be built in time.'' **********In January 1996, the race against the clock began. **********The most important parts of the scanner are the tubes, which focus the waves, and the detector, which translates them into pictures. So they received the heaviest attention. **********The old tubes, which cost $59,000 each to replace, had long been a thorn in GE's side. Hospitals and clinics wanted them to operate for at least 12 hours a day, for 6 months; typically, they lasted only half that long. Moreover, Gems was scrapping some $20 million in tubes each year because they failed preshipping performance tests. Even so, a disturbing number of faulty tubes were slipping past inspection, only to be pronounced dead-on-arrival -- Gems really does call them D.O.A.'s -- at the customer's door. **********So the Gems Six Sigma teams deconstructed the tubes. They knew that one problem involved the petroleum-based oil in the tube, which prevents short circuits by isolating the anode, which has a positive charge, from the negatively charged cathode. The oil often deteriorated after a few months, but they did not know why. By using statistical what-if scenarios on all parts of the tube, however, the researchers learned that the lead-based paint on the inside of the tube was adulterating the oil. By November 1996 they had developed a paint that would preserve the oil and protect the tube. **********Solving Leaks In Vacuum Tubes **********CT scanners generate X-rays by bombarding metals with high-speed electrons. Even a few air molecules can slow the electrons down, so the tube needs a total vacuum. But too many tubes were reaching the end of the production line with ''beads'' -- tiny openings, usually where glass and metal are sealed, that let air leak in. **********So Gems engineers made a list of things that could cause a vacuum leak. Through Six Sigma analysis, they ruled out type and length of glass. But they did learn that the metal pin through which current flows into the tube tended to tarnish, which would loosen the seal. They also found other significant factors: the type of gas used in processing the tube, and the speed with which the glass cooled down after going through a heat-treating furnace. **********Thus informed, the engineers used computer modeling to test numerous combinations of different temperatures, gases and such. They wound up ''pre-oxidizing'' the metal pin, roughening its surface and helping it adhere to the glass. They replaced the hydrogen gas with nitrogen. And they changed the heating process from one in which tubes move continuously through the furnace to one in which they are processed in fixed batches, making the heating and cooling periods easier to control. **********''Six Sigma gave us a methodical way to test how changes in one factor would interact with changes in others,'' said Beth Hulse, the engineer who led the project. **********Trying to eliminate all leaks would have put Gems way behind deadline and way over budget. And it was now early 1997. So Gems settled for a process that cut the pre-shipment scrap rate by 40 percent and that has eliminated D.O.A.'s so far. And while the new tubes are priced at $85,000, or 40 percent more, they carry a one-year warranty. **********Helping Reduce False Readings **********Converting an electron beam to X-ray images is not an efficient process. Only about 1 percent of the energy that hits human tissue emerges as light, with the rest dissipated as heat. And that heat can affect the quality of the image. **********Statistical analysis showed that adding a $100,000 resistor would control the temperature. But the same tests also revealed that changing a few inexpensive capacitors elsewhere in the tube, and redesigning how the wires are padded, would yield a similar result. **********Another way to cut down on fuzzy images and false readings -- detection of tumors that are not really there, for example -- would have been to tighten the specifications for the focal point, the accuracy with which the electron beam hits the target tissue. But that would have involved a costly tube redesign. **********By April 1997, a Six Sigma team had learned that widening the tungsten wires that cover many of the wave-receptor cells in the detector plate would create a bigger target, thereby compensating for any tiny inaccuracies in the beam's trajectory. Although this change requires giving the patient a higher dose of X-rays during the scan, the dose is still within the medically accepted margin of safety. ''By making the data collection process less efficient, we made the scanner as a whole more efficient,'' said Gary Strong, a Lightspeed designer. **********But the image quality still needed improvement. The detector surface in each scanner has thousands of ''pre-amp chips,'' semiconductor components that amplify the light signals so that a computer can read them. But each chip emits some energy itself, which in turn gets picked up by other chips, causing extraneous rings or shadows in the image. **********Redesigning the chips, Gems concluded, would take at least eight months, which could mean missing the target date for field tests: April 1998. But Six Sigma analyses showed that Gems could get the same result by relaxing specifications for the relationship between the amount of energy that comes into and out of the pre-amps, and by writing simple software that would allow the computer to control the variation. The project was completed last March -- just before the deadline for the field tests. **********The Lightspeed, which went on the market in September, costs 25 percent more than older scanners but seems to be a hit. Gems has installed 12 Lightspeeds, and has orders for 50 more. **********But the Six Sigma work at Gems is far from over. The Gems chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, is working on projects to find a better way to position flexible tabs -- the items that keep electrons in alignment as they travel across the detection panels. And he will soon join a team that will apply Six Sigma methods to reduce variances in customer service. **********''Six Sigma lets you approach problems with the assumption that there's a data-oriented, tangible fix at the end,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''And that is a radical culture change.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/business/some-doubts-on-lie-detection-by-phone.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1998-01-26", "snippet": "Makh-Shevet, small Israeli high-technology company, introduces new software, Truster, inexpensive lie-detector test that can be used over phone; company says its software can detect whether subject is under stress, fudging an answer or lying outri...", "word_count": 868, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some Doubts on Lie Detection by Phone", "print_headline": "Some Doubts on Lie Detection by Phone", "body_text": " **********Is your employee taking drugs? Has your mate had an affair? Is the check really in the mail? **********To get at the truth, you may no longer need keen insight -- just a personal computer with a CD-ROM drive. So say the makers of Truster, an inexpensive new lie-detector test that can also be used over the phone. Makh-Shevet, a small Israeli high-technology company, insists that its $149 software can detect whether a subject is under stress, fudging an answer or lying outright. **********''If you want to buy a new car, or a used car, you can ask the salesman how many accidents it has been in,'' said Tamir Segal, the company's president. ''What about blind dates? There will be no more blind dates. The only thing that'll remain blind is the way he looks.'' **********But the question is can one trust Truster to ferret out the truth -- especially since its inventors are neophytes in the field of lie detection? Mr. Segal is a longtime software entrepreneur; his partner, Amir Liberman, 25, delayed university studies to develop the program. **********The two men insist their computer program, which measures changes in voice frequency, is 85 percent accurate in identifying stress that is indicative of a lie. They say more formal studies are pending, including research by the Israeli military. **********Indeed, the company created Truster for the military to use in stopping terrorists at Israeli border checkpoints. Mr. Segal said the product had myriad other applications, like pre-employment testing. It can be used in person or over the telephone by attaching a computer to a phone receiver with a special cable. **********The military version will not be on the market until June, but the consumer version is a hot item. Since the Truster was made available on Dec. 15, the company says, it has sold more than 2,200 copies. It has distribution deals in Germany, Singapore and South Africa. The American distributor, Unipress Software of Edison, N.J., is set to begin shipping. **********Even so, there are skeptics. Don Weinstein of the American Polygraph Association, said he had yet to see reliability studies for any voice-based stress evaluators, the general category of this technology. His reservations echo a dispute in the lie-detector industry, in which competitors sometimes accuse one another of, well, lying. Specifically, the polygraph advocates say that voice-based truth tests do not yet pass muster or that studies do not exist to prove their efficacy. Polygraph machines, which cost $5,000 to $10,000, use electrodes to measure respiration, blood pressure and pulse. **********Voice-stress analyzers, including Truster, measure changes in voice frequency. David Hughes, executive director of the National Institute for Truth Verification, defends voice tests as highly accurate. As evidence, he says that more than 600 police agencies in the United States use high-end voice-stress analyzers costing $5,000 to $8,000. **********But Mr. Hughes questions whether the home-based Truster software can be of much use without professional training. ''You have to learn how to couch the questions properly,'' he said. ''I like to use the example: 'What if the answer is, Yes, we have no bananas.' What have you learned?'' Efficacy aside, there are legal questions about Truster's use. In many states it is illegal to tape a conversation without a person's knowledge. Mr. Segal said Truster does not require taping a person's voice, but the company recommends getting legal advice before using the product. **********A user installs the Truster software on a Windows 95 or Windows NT computer and then links the computer to the phone. The software displays two boxes on the monitor, one showing the frequency wave of a person's voice, the other characterizing the speaker's accuracy. **********It is necessary to establish a baseline of truthfulness in a conversation. That allows the software to calibrate the person's stress level when he or she lies. The key, the software's creators said, is picking up stress that occurs when the mind and the mouth are not synchronized. ''When people lie, their mind is not happy with what their mouth is saying,'' Mr. Segal said. ''This conflict is shown in very specific frequencies. This is where we hunt the deception.'' **********Mr. Segal purchased Makh-Shevet in 1991 and focused on computer and education software. Last year, in looking for a new direction, he came upon Mr. Liberman, who had a longtime interest in psychology and mathematics. Mr. Liberman had been working on an algorithm to measure truthfulness in voice patterns. Eventually, he finished the product with help from several mathematicians and a psychologist. **********Mr. Segal said the product could generate $15 million in sales this year. In addition, he hinted at a greater benefit: ''What kind of society are we going to have when everybody has the Truster? People will think twice before they say things'' that are dishonest. **********Or could it just make people paranoid? ''That's a hard question,'' Mr. Segal said, adding that he decided to sell the software for $150, rather than $50, to make sure that only serious users would sign up. ''We could have charged less,'' he added, ''but we don't think this should be treated as a gimmick.'' **********Is that really the logic behind the pricing?

Because the form is signed under penalty of perjury, people who employ household help must choose between declaring the taxes due and lying to the Government. **********The response was immediate, if not exactly what Congress had in mind: The number of people paying the tax on household help fell 40 percent, from nearly 500,000 in 1994 to just below 300,000 in 1995, the year the new law took effect, and 314,000 in 1996, and the Internal Revenue Service expects little change for 1997. **********Based on I.R.S. estimates that as many as four million people owe nanny taxes each year, that means that fewer than 1 in 13 are obeying the law, compared with 1 in 8 under the old, more cumbersome reporting system. And some people have even figured out how to combine a legal tax break for child care with tax evasion, in essence double-dipping the system. **********Of course, the main reason for the cheating is probably that it is so easy to get away with: Of the millions who have flouted the new law, only two have been charged with wrongdoing. **********''My accountant told me I have to stop this and issue paycheck stubs and report what I pay to the I.R.S.,'' said Elaine, a divorced 42-year-old mother of two who covers Hollywood for a magazine and asked that her last name not be used.

Soled, a Rutgers University tax expert who has studied tax cheating by people who consider themselves honest. Political attacks on the current tax system as unfair only encourage people to cheat on the ground that ''this is our way of evening the playing field,'' he said, adding, ''This is a dangerous game.'' **********Dangerous or not, Elaine is probably right not to fear the wrath of the tax collector. There is no national nanny-tax enforcement effort because of a lack of staff, said Tom Burger, the I.R.S. official in charge of employment taxes. Indeed, the service has never pressed a civil case in court and has filed criminal charges only twice, both times as part of a more serious criminal prosecution. **********The law requires anyone who pays a nanny or other servant more than $1,100 this year to report those wages to the I.R.S. Assuming that only one in 13 is doing so -- and that the tax evaders spend as much on household help as the upright citizens do -- the Federal Government is losing $1.2 billion a year in Social Security and Medicare taxes. **********To be sure, some people question whether the problem is as serious as the I.R.S. contends. Michael Graetz, a Yale Law School professor and former Bush Administration tax official, said he thought the agency's estimate was inflated. And he says fewer people may be reporting because their accountants advised them that they were exempt from nanny taxes because their maid or gardener was arguably an independent contractor, not an employee. **********For those who know they are cheating, the motive is often not only to save money but also to avoid paperwork and the inevitable exasperation that comes with dealing with the tax bureaucracy. **********''The truth is that Government has not made it easier to comply,'' said Roger L. Conner, executive director of the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a Washington nonprofit group that urges people to become more involved in their local communities. ''Congress made it easier on the Federal level, but you also have to pay state taxes and pay state unemployment taxes, and if you live in one state and your nanny in another, then you are forced to master the arcana of Social Security and Federal unemployment taxes plus two state unemployment and tax systems.'' **********James Neff, a journalism professor at Ohio State University who writes books on crime, said he discovered how frustrating complying with state requirements could be after he used three nannies last summer. Together they made slightly more than $1,500, the threshold for paying quarterly state unemployment taxes, and Mr. Neff discovered that he had to cope with complex state tax forms designed for corporations, not individuals. **********Worse, even though Mr. Neff only used nannies in the summer, the state required him to file every quarter and report zero as the amount due for the other three seasons. **********In interviews, parents in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Virginia and the District of Columbia reported similar difficulties dealing with state tax forms designed for corporations rather than individuals. One of their greatest frustrations was navigating through bureaucracies that they said were unresponsive or, worse, behaved as if their efforts to comply were a nuisance. **********Mr. Neff and others who pay the taxes say they do so not only out of moral duty but also because they or their spouses hold jobs that require scrupulous compliance with all laws. Mr. Neff's wife is a Federal prosecutor; Mr. Conner's organization preaches self-reliance and individual responsibility for the welfare of communities. **********Many Americans legally avoid the nanny tax by sending children to day-care centers or by hiring maid services or lawn-care companies rather than paying individuals directly. Also, maids who bring their own tools and cleaning solutions are arguably independent contractors, not employees, and thus might be exempt from the nanny tax. **********Even if an employer wants to go by the book, household servants -- many of whom are immigrants or welfare recipients, or juggling more than one job -- often accept money only under the table. **********In Central Park in New York, a nanny who was taking her charge to a playground and who identified herself only as Elena said her weekly pay included a $100 check and $260 in cash. The check allows her employers to take advantage of a tax break known as a flexible spending account in which $5,000 is deducted from their paychecks and then reimbursed when they produce canceled checks and a Social Security number for their nanny. The I.R.S. does not routinely match these payments with tax returns, however. **********Thus, they benefit twice, saving as much as $1,980 through a legal deduction and almost $1,400 more by evading their share of the nanny's Social Security and Medicare taxes. **********Michael Josephson, founder of Character Counts in Marina del Rey, Calif., which promotes ethical behavior by youngsters, said he did not even know the nanny tax existed until the Zoe Baird hearings. He said he then felt compelled to pay five years of back nanny taxes, penalties and interest. **********Mr. Josephson said he thought the Government should either enforce the nanny tax or repeal it. ''Congress needs to be thinking about this law that makes honest people feel like fools,'' he said. **********There is no move in Congress to overhaul the system at the moment, and tax specialists say they see no easy solution. But, they say, some of the more promising ideas being kicked around include making all household servants independent contractors, responsible for their own taxes; raising the threshold to $5,000 or higher from $1,100, then making a greater effort at enforcement and imposing a surtax somewhere else, perhaps a fraction of a penny on each gallon of gasoline, to cover the lost Social Security and Medicare taxes. **********Failure to pay the nanny tax can boomerang in the long run, for both parties involved. Social Security benefits are now based solely on reported wages, so household servants who never report their income can face poverty in old age unless they plan to return to countries where their needs will be met in other ways. **********They might also make life difficult for their former employers by reporting the income years later in an effort to get more Social Security money. **********Mr. Josephson recommended making nanny-tax compliance an issue in audits of all higher-income people because ''almost everyone over a certain income, especially when both of the couple work, has a maid, a nanny or both.'' **********Turning a blind eye to the problem, he added, is the worst possible way to deal with it. ''When the Government encourages systematic lying, it undermines the whole notion of voluntary compliance'' on which the tax system rests, he said. ''It has an incredibly corrosive effect on people voluntarily complying with all tax laws.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/31/business/labor-costs-rose-slightly-in-the-spring.html": {"writer_name": "Sylvia Nasar", "pub_date": "1998-07-31", "snippet": "Labor Department's employment cost index, broad gauge of compensation trends watched by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent this spring, slightly more than seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in winter; for 12 mon...", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Labor Costs Rose Slightly In the Spring", "print_headline": "Labor Costs Rose Slightly In the Spring", "body_text": " **********Despite signs that economic growth is slowing sharply, wages and benefits are climbing a bit faster than a year ago. **********The Labor Department's employment cost index -- a broad gauge of compensation trends closely watched by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other policy makers -- rose nine-tenths of 1 percent this spring, slightly more than the seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in the winter. For the 12 months ended in June, pay for all civilian workers, including government workers, rose 3.5 percent, up from 2.8 percent in the previous year. **********The pickup in labor costs reflects one of the tightest peacetime labor markets in memory. Even as the Asian crisis, the recently settled General Motors strike and a lull in inventory additions have combined to drag down growth in recent months, unemployment is well below 5 percent, as it has been for a year, hiring plans have remained robust, and thousands of jobs in industries from high technology to hotels have gone begging. **********The acceleration in wage inflation is of the creeping, not galloping, variety: pay and benefits are rising just one percentage point faster than at the low-point for such cost increases nearly three years ago. **********As such, the latest reading is not likely to provoke Mr. Greenspan, who only a week ago reiterated how closely he watches the index, to raise interest rates. **********''We haven't moved into new territory,'' said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Financial Group in Boston. ''This report reduces the odds that the Fed will tighten.'' **********Ever since unemployment first slipped below the level that most economists regard as consistent with steady inflation, the Federal Reserve has been on the lookout for any hint that wage pressures are getting out of hand. But now that the economy seems to be slowing on its own, the modest pickup in pay may well show up in slimmer profit margins rather than in higher prices for consumers. Investors, in any case, seemed to take that view. Bond prices rose after the report's release, and the stock market closed higher ahead of today's much anticipated report on economic growth for the second quarter. **********Workers are getting a better deal than the raw numbers imply. Thanks to a minuscule 1.6 percent rise in the cost of living over the last year, relatively restrained nominal pay increases are being translated into relatively robust real gains. Real pay is up nearly 2 percent from a year ago. **********If anything, the employment cost index, though widely regarded as the broadest and most reliable gauge of employers' labor costs, may understate just how well workers are doing. It does not include one-time payments like signing bonuses and bounties, which businesses are increasingly relying on to fill vacancies without raising their entire pay structure. It also does not take account of another widespread phenomenon: promotions that are given purely to raise a worker's pay or promotions that workers give themselves by switching to better-paying jobs. One sign that these factors may add up is that another Department of Labor measure, compensation per hour, has risen about a percentage point more in the last year than the employment cost index. ''We're seeing some dramatic wage inflation'' in some job categories, says Maury Hanigan, a human resources consultant in New York. **********Wages and salaries grew nine-tenths of 1 percent, not much more than the eight-tenths of 1 percent growth in the winter. But benefit costs jumped sharply to eight-tenths of 1 percent, twice as fast as they had risen in the previous quarter. Part of the pickup in benefit costs is probably temporary; it reflects commissions and bonuses being paid on Wall Street and elsewhere in the financial industry, where compensation has risen by 7 percent from a year ago. But at least half of the benefits, including Social Security payments and vacation pay, are tied directly to wages. And one-fifth consist of health benefits, which are once again marching higher. ''Health insurance costs are picking up for the first time in three and a half years,'' said Wayne M. Shelly, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issued the report. **********Wage pressures may not fade. Some of the forces holding down living costs are clearly temporary. As Asia struggles back, oil prices are apt to firm. And the strong dollar, which has made many imports a bargain, could weaken. **********More important, even if the economy settles down to a growth rate of 2 percent or 2.5 percent over the next year or so -- as Mr. Greenspan and other forecasters expect -- it will not be slow enough to loosen up the labor market much. ''The unemployment rate stays exactly where it is,'' Mr. Perna predicted. ''The overall degree of tightness stays exactly where it is.'' **********Two other reports made public yesterday suggest that this is the case right now. The Conference Board reported that its help-wanted advertising index rose to 91 in June  from 90 in May and 88 a year ago. And new claims for unemployment insurance dropped to 304,000 last week from 317,000 the week before, the Labor Department said. That's the lowest level since early April."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/09/world/yeltsin-s-silence-fuels-talk-of-new-choices-for-premier.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1998-09-09", "snippet": "Russian Pres Boris Yeltsin remains holed with advisers at residence outside Moscow, pondering next move after Communist-led Parliament rejected for second time Viktor S Chernomyrdin, his choice for Prime Minister; Yeltsin's silence underscores his...", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin's Silence Fuels Talk Of New Choices for Premier", "print_headline": "Yeltsin's Silence Fuels Talk Of New Choices for Premier", "body_text": " **********The big news in Russia today was what did not happen. **********After the Communist-led Parliament, in a stormy debate on Monday, again rejected Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's  choice for Prime Minister, the President did not rush to renominate him. **********Instead, Mr. Yeltsin was holed up with his advisers at his residence just outside Moscow, pondering his hand. The silence out of Mr. Yeltsin's headquarters underscored his dilemma and nourished speculation that he was considering other candidates. **********''It is now the President's turn to have his say,'' said Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader. **********None of Mr. Yeltsin's choices are good. Mr. Yeltsin could press ahead with Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination and dare the Communist-led Parliament to vote down his choice for a third time, a move that would force the dissolution of the legislature. **********That would enable Mr. Yeltsin to stand firm against the Communists, but it would turn the political battles over the last two weeks into an all-out war. The Communists warned the President today against disbanding the Parliament and trying to rule by decree, invoking the specter of huge social unrest. **********Mr. Yeltsin could settle on a compromise candidate. That would spare the nation a prolonged political squabble as the Russian economy is reeling. But that could also mean ceding influence and prestige to the Communists and perhaps backing away from market reforms. **********As the President weighed his options, the potential replacements for Mr. Chernomyrdin were piously hiding their ambition under a cloak of their humility and statesmanship. **********Yegor Stroyev, the 61-year-old leader of the upper house of the legislature, has often been mentioned as a compromise choice. A Yeltsin ally, he also serves as the head of the administration in Oryol, an agricultural area south of Moscow that tends to be pro-Communist and was the birthplace of Mr. Zyuganov. **********Today Mr. Stroyev urged Mr. Yeltsin to think long and hard before re-entering the political fray, but insisted that he had no interest in being  Prime Minister. He endorsed Yevgeny M. Primakov, the hard-line Foreign Minister whose candidacy has also been promoted by Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko Party. **********Mr. Primakov was not to be outdone in disclaiming any interest in higher office. This afternoon he issued a statement emphasizing how happy he was in his current job and asserting that he had not encouraged Mr. Yavlinsky to propose him as Prime Minister. **********''I cannot consent to this,'' he said. **********But the canny Foreign Minister seemed to leave the door open a crack. ''It is my consistent belief,'' he said, ''that a way must be found out of the current political crisis within the shortest possible time by means of consensus.'' **********That left the Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, who has been waging an entirely unsubtle campaign to position himself as a likely successor to  Mr. Yeltsin. **********Mr. Luzhkov raised eyebrows the other day by criticizing Mr. Chernomyrdin. But today he insisted that he had not talked to Mr. Yeltsin about taking Mr. Chernomyrdin's place. **********''I am already head of the Moscow government,'' he said. ''Isn't that enough?'' **********As Moscow speculated about just who might be nominated, Mr. Chernomyrdin sought to demonstrate that it was too soon to write his political obituary. **********His aides today issued a blizzard of decrees and statements intended to show that their man was on the job and in control of the situation. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin, they announced, had signed decrees on customs duties, bank policy and personnel. All told, Mr. Chernomyrdin has signed 67 resolutions and 58 directives since he was appointed Acting Prime Minister last month, his spokesman said. **********As Russia's leaders jockeyed for power, the economic collapse continued. The exchange rate slipped to 23 rubles to the dollar, a far cry from the rate of 6.2 rubles in mid-August. There was talk of postponing the last major privatization of a state oil company for lack of buyers. **********The enclave of Kaliningrad declared a state of emergency. Workers struck in the closed nuclear cities of Chelyabinsk and Arzamus over wage arrears and even picketed in front of the Atomic Energy Ministry building in Moscow. **********As the politicians caught their breath before another round of wrangling and intrigue, even they agreed that Russia would pay a heavy price for allowing the political circus to go on for too much longer. **********''It is impossible to calculate the budget in these conditions,'' said Aleksandr Zhukov, chairman of the Parliament's budget committee.

Rising prices!'' they shouted as they smashed a couple of windows and tried unsuccessfully to set a barrel of kerosene on fire, angered by reports that a Kraton merchant had raised prices. **********The police quickly choked off the riot, though shopkeepers had pulled down their metal shutters and retreated into back rooms. The green and blue shutters of most shops remained closed today, and the town was still tense. **********Half a mile away, Semari seemed as calm as ever. White cows grazed in its bright green pasture and sunshine sparkled from its flooded rice fields. Men smoked quietly on cool porches. Small children, seeing a foreign visitor, called out the only words of English they knew: ''One, two, three, four!'' **********Here on the far eastern tip of Indonesia's main island of Java, the political debate of the capital city of Jakarta seemed worlds away. Currency devaluations, collapsing banks and frightened stock markets are unknown concepts in Semari. No one here has heard of the International Monetary Fund, which has imposed an economic austerity program as part of a $40 billion rescue package. **********But Semari and villages like it around this vast nation of 200 million are at the heart of the crisis that threatens Indonesia's stability. And the people here know exactly why that is. **********''Let me tell you something: the problem is the price hikes,'' said Muhammad Jamil, a 37-year-old farmer. ''Our income stays the same, but prices keep going up. If the prices come down, the problems will be solved. That's the solution. Just bring down the prices.'' **********On the other hand, he said, ''If the prices keep going up, we'll protest in the streets.'' **********It is already happening up and down the coast of eastern Java, as well as in several other places. In a dozen towns over the last two weeks, small riots have broken out as the prices of rice, cooking oil, kerosene, flour and other staples have begun to rise. **********Most analysts say this is just the beginning. Government price supports are only now starting to be removed from staple items as part of the I.M.F. plan. Gasoline prices are scheduled to rise in two months. Bigger, broader and more damaging riots are feared as inflation intensifies and prices rise further. **********Indonesia is already a restive nation, held together by force for the last 32 years under President Suharto. A pervasive government apparatus offers little outlet for grievances over corruption, abusive officials, unresponsive courts, disparities in wealth and wrenching cultural changes as cities grow and new factory towns devour fertile farmland. **********''There is no rule of law,'' said Saukat Mifta, a 48-year-old businessman who lives in Kraton. ''There is no way for people to channel their frustrations. The common people feel they are ignored by the law. The Government does not respond to their complaints. So if there's a problem, they quickly become angry and they turn to violence. They don't try to understand. They just react.'' **********And so, as life becomes harsher for the farmers and fishermen here, even unfounded rumors of price rises have been enough to spark riots in places like Kraton. **********As they gathered around a visitor to shout their complaints today, the villagers of Semari were a fount of exaggerated reports of rising rices. **********''Kerosene is 1,000 rupiah a liter, can you believe it?'' they said. ''Rice is up to 2,000. Cooking oil is 6,000. Everything is up! Some say sugar is 6,000 a kilo.'' **********A woman whispered, ''Coconuts cost 200 each.'' **********These are impossible prices, said a farmer named Abdul Mukti. ''Can you imagine, just 2,000 rupiah for working all day in the fields, and then prices like that? What if you have three kids to feed?'' **********Before the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, began its steep fall last summer, 2,000 rupiah was worth about 80 cents. Today its value is closer to 20 cents. **********So on Monday morning, when word spread that a prominent Kraton trader named Nuning had raised the price of a liter of kerosene to 1,000 rupiah from 350, the people of Semari were already seething. Kerosene is a key commodity, used by many Indonesians to fuel kitchen stoves. **********''We headed into town,'' said Mr. Jamil, the farmer. **********''Raising our knives!'' shouted a young man. **********''No, no, no,'' the older men hushed him, glancing at their visitor. ''No knives. No knives.'' **********Men from another village brought two small potash bombs that are used illegally by fishermen to stun fish. One was a dud, the villagers said, but one exploded in front of the iron shutters of Mrs. Nuning's shop. (Like many Indonesians, she uses only one name.) **********''The interesting thing is that Nu ning hadn't raised her prices,'' said Mr. Saukat, whose mother-in-law owns a restaurant across the street from Mrs. Nuning's shop. ''She wasn't even open that day. She hadn't been open for five days.'' Many Indonesian shops had not yet reopened following the Muslim holiday last week that ended the holy month of Ramadan. **********But like so many of the conflicts that have produced Indonesia's crisis -- from small-town riots to questions of governmental mismanagement -- events here were driven as much by personal frictions and rivalries as by deep-rooted issues. **********''She's known as a rude person,'' Mr. Saukat said, voicing what seemed a common opinion in the nearby marketplace, where people described Mrs. Nuning as ''hardheaded'' and ''troublesome.'' Mrs. Nuning was not available to defend her reputation; she was under military guard in a local hotel. **********One local version of the Kraton riot is that a rival kerosene merchant had spread the rumor that Mrs. Nu ning had raised her prices. On a broader stage, a prominent official in eastern Java has suggested that a rival politician is fomenting riots to discredit him. **********Along with deepening poverty and spreading unemployment, the economic crisis has heightened frictions between political and economic rivals, between employers and their workers, between shopkeepers and their customers and between ethnic and religious groups. **********However the crisis plays out, everyone here seems to agree, Indonesia has become a more dangerous place. **********As in many a town in many a country, the last word today came in the Kraton market's barbershop, a tiny whitewashed room decorated with demure pinups of women wearing Muslim head scarves. **********''These price increases are incredible, incredible,'' said Dahlan, 65, a retired furniture finisher who spends his days relaxing on a small bench here. ''It's not a game anymore.'' **********His friend Suwandi, a retired military officer, agreed. ''The common people are shaken,'' he said. ''They're confused. It's going to be noisy here. People will shout.

His and her horoscopes. Articles such as ''Can You Really Tell If Someone's a Virgin?'' and ''Six Star Couples' Secrets for Everlasting Love.'' **********Can this magazine possibly be coming from Henry R. Luce's venerable, button-down Time Inc.? That male bastion of testosterone titles like Time, Sports Illustrated, Money and Fortune? Yes, indeed. Tomorrow, Teen People is scheduled to hit the newsstands, and it is something of a significant departure for its publisher, Time Inc. **********The monthly magazine, aimed at teen-age girls, combines the standard teen-age fare of beauty, fashion and boys with the People magazine formula that has proved so successful: articles about celebrities and entertainment, leavened with a dose of real-life issues. **********But it goes beyond the People approach into a type of service journalism that has stealthily been infiltrating the Time Inc. stable to the point that it now includes everything from In Style's celebrity living rooms to Cooking Light's high-calcium goat cheese quesadillas. **********Given Time Inc.'s reputation as a male-dominated company that has spoken mostly to adult male readers, Teen People also exemplifies the latest and perhaps most extreme example of how the company is aggressively extending its reach to new audiences: women, children, teen-agers and minorities. **********''I've always felt that women and children are underserved,'' said Ann S. Moore, the president of People, In Style, Teen People and People en Espanol. ''Marketing to women, writing to women is not something we traditionally did at Time. We had a lot of men's books, a lot of news magazines, but we didn't have a division that understood women. I think we have that expertise now.'' **********On Monday, Time Inc. will also switch People en Espanol to monthly publication (it started as a quarterly in October 1996). That magazine, aimed at a growing Hispanic market, was the fourth -- and Teen People is the fifth -- new title to grow out of People. The first was Entertainment Weekly, in 1990. That was followed by Who, an Australian version of People that started in 1992, and In Style, in 1994. **********''We approached all the projects in this division looking at them from the point of view of what readers we were missing,'' Ms. Moore said. ''We've targeted women, teens and Hispanics, and the bonus has been that we have extended the franchise into new ad categories because we've brought in new readers to the company.'' **********These spinoffs -- known as brand extensions in the marketing world -- are part of a larger strategy that has been gradually taking shape at Time Inc., a division of Time Warner and one of the nation's most prominent magazine publishers. In essence, Time Inc. hopes to trade on the strength of its established titles without diluting the core publications. ''It's been an evolution,'' said Don Logan, the chairman and chief executive of the company. ''I can assure you,'' he added, ''Time Inc. will continue to publish new titles.'' **********People, which is read mostly by women, was the first to rock the Time Inc. boat when it was introduced in 1974, prompting some to proclaim the death of the company. Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser of Time Inc., recalled: ''To some of the purists inside the building it seemed frivolous and a stain on the escutcheon of Time Inc. We took a fair amount of hits early on, but we survived.'' **********If Time Inc. was unfamiliar with the world of women's magazines -- an age-old formula that includes fashion, beauty, fitness, food and sex -- it has educated itself over the years through a series of start-ups and acquisitions. In 1985, the company bought Southern Progress, the Alabama company that publishes the monthlies Southern Living and Cooking Light and that recently acquired Weight Watchers and started Coastal Living, both of which are published about every other month. **********Time Inc. went on to add the monthlies Parenting, Sports Illustrated for Kids, Sunset, Baby Talk and Martha Stewart Living, which the company sold last year, although it still retains a minority interest. **********This diversification has accelerated under Mr. Logan, who came to Time Inc. as president and chief operating officer in 1992 from Southern Progress and was appointed chief executive in 1994. Under him, Time Inc. has added the weekly Time for Kids as well as This Old House and the shelter magazine Wallpaper, both of which will be published eight times this year, and the monthlies In Style, People en Espanol and, now, Teen People. **********In addition, five years ago, Time Inc. began managing American Express's titles, including the monthlies Food and Wine and Travel and Leisure, and Departures, a magazine for platinum-card holders that is published every other month. **********Teen People ''makes Time Inc. a different-looking company than has been the popular perception,'' said Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc. ''But it is not as much a duck out of water as you might otherwise think.'' **********Still, some women's titles have proved easier than others. The company has yet to give the green light to Sports Illustrated Women/Sport, which had two test issues last year. Mr. Logan said: ''We're not in any big hurry to bring that magazine to market. It's a little more complicated than some of our people thought.'' **********While Teen People's photo spreads featuring platform sneakers and advertisements for plastic tampons may be new to the company, the magazine In Style paved the way for hard-core fashion and beauty coverage. ''I hired the first-ever beauty editor at Time Inc.,'' said Martha Nelson, the managing editor. ''When we launched the magazine, we used to say that Henry Luce would be spinning in his grave because we published a horoscope.'' **********As a result, though Teen People might have once been an intolerable shock to the Time Inc. system, these days even the company's old-timers see it as business as usual. **********''There is real logic in applying the People concept to a magazine aimed at that audience,'' said Henry Muller, the editorial director at Time Inc., who has been at the company since 1970. ''Time Inc., in many people's minds, still conveys an image that is a quarter of a century out of date.'' **********For one thing, the demographics argue strongly for an entry into the teen-age market. The nation's teen-age population is projected to grow to 34 million from 29 million by 2010 and now accounts for about $122 billion in consumer spending. **********More simply, Time Inc.'s brand-extension strategy is paying off. Mr. Logan estimated 1997 earnings in the range of $600 million on revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, up from $530 million in 1996 on revenue of $4.1 billion. Even Time Warner's stock price is finally looking up, having reached a 52-week high of $62 at the end of last year -- up from a low of $36.375 in January 1997. Yesterday it closed at $61.9375, up $1.625. **********Nevertheless, Teen People still sticks out a bit in the Time Inc. culture. The magazine's executives say their fashion closet -- where clothes are stored for coming photo assignments -- has become something of a curiosity at the company. **********''The management team knows nothing about fashion,'' said Nora McAniff, the publisher of Teen People and People. ''If Mel Gibson walked in the room, I don't think Don Logan would know who he was. Now we're talking to him about Puff Daddy,'' the rap star. **********Moreover, this venture is perhaps a riskier one because Teen People is entering a crowded, intensely competitive market and because Time Inc. has gone down this road before. In 1994, it unsuccessfully tested the teen-age magazine Mouth 2 Mouth, a venture that joined a graveyard already crowded with the failed teen-age titles Tell, which was published by Hachette Filipacchi and NBC, and Quake, a venture of Welsh Publishing Group and Cowles Magazines. **********More recently, the teen magazine Sassy closed and was merged into Teen by Petersen Publishing, which owned both. **********Nevertheless, the teen-age market has grown increasingly strong, and Teen People will jockey for newsstand attention with such heavyweights as Primedia's Seventeen (circulation 2.5 million), Gruner & Jahr's YM (2.1 million) and Petersen's Teen (1.7 million). **********Two new publications entered the field last year: Jump, published by Weider Publications, and Twist, published by the German company Bauer Publishing. A teen-age title called Glossy, which will appear every other month, is due to start this month, an outgrowth of the teen-age Webzine glossy.com., owned by Attitude Network Ltd. **********Publishers of established teen-age titles say they welcome new competition and do not view the new Time Inc. entry as a threat. ''It's narrower than our magazine,'' said John Heins, president and chief executive of YM's publisher. ''The People name does not mean beauty; the People name does not mean fashion.'' **********Indeed, because Time Inc. is new to the traditional teen-age categories, some magazine experts wonder whether it will be able to compete with the big guns. ''Time is going to have a lot of problems doing the kind of synergistic editorial that fashion and beauty advertisers want,'' said Martin Walker, a New York magazine consultant. ''In most teen magazines, the editorial is really about your advertisers' products. That's not what Time Inc. does; they do news magazines, and the advertisers come in to reach the audience.'' **********But Teen People -- which is guaranteeing advertisers a circulation of 500,000 -- maintains that there is a place in the market for something new. ''We will leave the boy-crazy niche to the ones who are already filling it very nicely,'' Ms. Moore said. '' We only win if we can deliver something different.'' **********Christina Ferrari, Teen People's managing editor, said the magazine would not use professional models and would feature teen-agers in a range of shapes, sizes and races. ''We decided we're going to go all the way,'' said Ms. Ferrari, who spent two years as executive editor at YM and one year as editor in chief. ''Teen-agers need images that reflect who they really are and what they really look like.'' **********While most teen-age magazines focus on fashion and beauty, Teen People will devote a third of its editorial space to celebrities and another third to articles about ''real'' issues, such as eating disorders and college drinking. And though Teen People -- which calls itself the first magazine to start simultaneously on the World Wide Web -- expects to be read mostly by young women, it also hopes young men will make up about 15 percent of the audience. **********Perhaps the most distinguishing feature about the new magazine is that it has behind it People (which folks at Time Inc. have now taken to calling Big People). **********By Time Inc.'s figures, five million teen-agers already read People. With a circulation of 3.5 million and ad pages that have steadily increased, People has become Time Inc.'s showpiece, leading the Cappell Circulation Report's 1997 list of most impressive performers. **********People spinoffs have exceeded Time Inc.'s financial expectations -- In Style became profitable last year, about three years in advance of initial projections, and Entertainment Weekly achieved profitability in 1996, a year ahead of schedule. Mr. Logan said he expected Teen People to turn a profit in three to four years. **********That is why the editors finally decided it would be foolish not to make the People connection loud and clear, even though Time Inc. considered other names for the magazine such as The Mix and 411. (Petersen Publishing is suing Time Inc. for using the word Teen.) **********It is also why Teen People will look and sound a lot like People, including teen-age versions of popular People columns such as Star Tracks (celebrity photos) and Style Watch (celebrity fashion). **********''They've locked on the strength of the People franchise,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media at the McCann-Erickson ad agency. ''There are enough similarities so that you know you're reading People and enough differences so you're not confused.'' **********Nevertheless, a teen-age girl trolling for lip gloss advice will not be disappointed. The magazine devotes the final third of its editorial space to clothes, makeup and hair. **********''There is a balance between service and journalism and education and so forth, and it seems to me the balance is right,'' said Mr. Pearlstine, Time Inc.'s editor in chief. ''The idea of doing a magazine for teens that denies the importance of appearance doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If you want to do Ms. magazine for teens, be my guest.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/18/business/business-digest-913600.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 548, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********3 Ex-Archer Executives Convicted of Fixing Prices **********Three former executives of Archer Daniels Midland -- including the son of its powerful chairman, Dwayne Andreas -- were found guilty of engaging in an international conspiracy to fix the prices of a widely used additive for animal feed. **********The verdict by a Federal jury in Chicago marked an important victory for prosecutors and capped a six-year effort by the Government to crack an illegal cartel and to bring participants in the conspiracy to trial.

That region accounted for 20 percent of AMP 1997 sales.

Young, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''With a strong management team, a combination with Allied Signal could lead to some nice synergies.'' **********Allied Signal's offer, if accepted, would dilute Allied earnings by 27 cents a share, said Mr. Bossidy. It would be financed by the sale of $2 billion worth of Allied assets -- some analysts suggested in the automotive business -- as well as a $1.5 billion equity offering. That would offset the dilution, he said, and 1999 earnings of the combined companies would rise 13 to 17 percent. He added that the combination would generate cash flow of $200 million in 1999, $300 million in 2000 and an additional $100 million in 2001. **********Analysts attending a meeting with Allied executives were skeptical of Mr. Bossidy's projections, particularly because his team had not inspected AMP's books. **********''This strikes me as a kind of 'trust me in 2000 and 2001,' '' one analyst said. ''What is your competence on these numbers?'' Mr. Bossidy replied, ''I don't think we have any rose-colored glasses.'' He later added, ''It will be difficult.'' **********Allied may also face difficulties with its hostile offer because Pennsylvania has some of the toughest anti-takeover laws in the country. **********As a defensive measure, Allied filed a suit in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania in an attempt to insure that investors would not be denied the opportunity to consider the offer. **********Still, analysts agreed that the rich offer would put pressure on AMP's management to consider the bid carefully. **********''Part of the reason the premium is as big as it is is to get AMP shareholders in line,'' Mr. Young, the Lehman Brothers analyst said. ''If AMP management can't do as much as Allied Signal to get the stock price up, they run the risk of getting sued,'' by shareholders. **********Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Schroder & Company, said that Allied was seeking out AMP as an addition to what he said was a growing stable of high-growth and high-margin businesses. ''AMP is a dominant company in a niche that has seen its market position and profitability eroded fairly considerably,'' he said. ''But with a little bit of management smarts you can hopefully reinvigorate the company.'' **********Mr. Lustgarten said that by going after AMP, Mr. Bossidy was seeking to reinvigorate the company's growth early in the next century.

Toben, the units' chief financial officer, said the buyout applied to ''all director level and below management employees in my organization with limited exceptions.'' **********''No cap will be placed on the number of employees who will be allowed to accept the offer,'' her memo said, adding that the buyout plan was necessary to help her department meet a goal of reducing costs by 10 percent. **********Referring to the voluntary buyout plan, called the ''force management program,'' the message said, ''If a sufficient number of employees do not take advantage of the F.M.P. offer, an involuntary reduction in force (R.I.F.) may be required later in the year.'' **********According to the memo, employees will have until Oct. 14 to accept the offer, and those who join the program will be released from the company's payroll as of Oct. 16. **********In a voice-mail message early this week to ''all business marketing personnel,'' Ron Rothenbach, a vice president for marketing to business customers, suggested that major parts of Bell Atlantic might feel pressure to cut jobs. **********Referring to his boss, Bruce Gordon, the group president for retail marketing, Mr. Rothenbach said, ''I do have additional head-count challenges, challenges that have been leveled against the entire Gordon organization, and therefore, of course, mine.'' **********''We've grown from 1.5 percent to 3 percent in revenues,'' Mr. Rothenbach said, referring to his department's annual growth targets. ''We're still not making the revenue targets of 4.4 percent and as a result need to downsize so that the corporation can stay financially viable and be able to compete in the marketplace.'' **********Ms. Kraus said that Mr. Rothenbach was speaking for himself and not for the corporation as a whole. **********''One of the major benefits contemplated in the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex was the ability to eliminate certain duplication in employees, and some force reduction is not therefore a surprise,'' said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at Paine Webber. ''However, if it is true that revenue targets are coming below expectations this would by definition not have been anticipated and potentially suggests some other issues at work, potentially the effects of competition.'' **********Ms. Kraus did not estimate the size of Mr. Rothenbach's department.

McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Greenspan built a case that it was the central bank's responsibility to play a role in addressing a crisis whose effects could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term Capital's owners, investors and lenders. **********''Financial market participants were already unsettled by recent global events,'' Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the spread into Russia and Latin America of the financial crisis that began last year in Asia. **********''Had the failure of L.T.C.M. triggered the seizing up of markets, substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market participants, including some not directly involved in the firm, and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations, including our own,'' he said. [Excerpts, page C3.] **********Mr. Greenspan is usually heaped with praise for his stewardship of the economy when he appears before Congress, and the world has increasingly looked to him for leadership in containing the spreading financial crisis. But today, two days after the Fed cut interest rates in an effort to insulate the United States from that turmoil, Mr. Greenspan offered no words to reassure the markets, which fell sharply in another bout of selling. [Page C1.] **********Instead, Mr. Greenspan sat through a four-and-a-half-hour hearing in which he heard respectful but nonetheless pointed questions and doubts from members of both parties about the Federal Reserve's involvement in saving a risky investment fund that catered to the wealthy. **********Lawmakers expressed considerable reservations about the Federal Reserve's decision to use its influence to buy some time for Long-Term Capital last week by helping to arrange a $3.6 billion rescue package from a group of big banks and investment houses. **********They also asked whether the Federal Reserve and other regulators should do more to regulate hedge funds, which often make high-risk bets on the direction of stocks, bonds and exotic securities. They are structured in ways that enable them to largely avoid disclosure requirements that apply to brokerage firms, banks and other financial businesses. **********Representative Spencer T. Bachus 3d, Republican of Alabama, said the message from Washington to welfare mothers and small businesses had been ''that it's not the job of the Federal Government to rescue you.'' **********The same message, he said, ''ought to also apply to rich Greenwich, Conn., investors who are multimillionaires, that we ought to use the same standards that we've used on the welfare mothers on these large hedge funds.'' **********Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, said there seemed to be a gap between free-market theory and policy makers' decisions. **********''We hear a lot of speeches about free enterprise and the marketplace, but a lot of folks don't like to practice it,'' he said. ''The problem we have as representing our constituencies is that there seem to be two rules, a double standard: one for Main Street and another one for Wall Street.'' **********Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is the committee's chairman, said the structure of the rescue engineered by the Federal Reserve raised antitrust concerns. He also questioned whether it had undermined a separate offer from a group including Warren E. Buffett, the multibillionaire investor, and Goldman, Sachs & Company. The terms of that offer were reportedly less attractive to Long-Term Capital's owners, including its founder, John W. Meriwether, than the deal later struck by the group assembled by the Fed. **********''Perhaps the only smart deal of the month that Long-Term Capital did was they played the Fed off against another party,'' Mr. Leach said. **********Other members seemed to be searching in frustration for ways to contain the risks posed by a small number of investment firms operating outside the regulatory system. **********''I hope that we are going to be comforted that the regulators do now, in fact, have plans in place that would help avert such unfortunate circumstances in our future,'' said Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana. **********Mr. Greenspan, however, stuck to his position that it would be difficult or even counterproductive to impose more direct regulation on hedge funds. Regulating the funds, Mr. Greenspan said, would drive them to operate from other nations with looser regulations, undermining the ability of the United States to monitor them even indirectly through their lenders and investors. **********The best way to rein in gambling by those firms, Mr. Greenspan said, is to encourage their lenders to assess rigorously the risks they are taking and deny credit to those whose bets become unwise. In that way, he said, banking supervisors and other regulators can act as a second line of defense by pushing lenders to make sure their risk assessments are adequate. **********Under questioning from members of the panel, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that same approach had failed in the case of Long-Term Capital Management. **********But he said that such failures were inevitable in markets, that he had been surprised at how few had occurred in the last five years and that he expected more of them in the future. Moreover, he said, if the financial system is unwilling to assume risks, the economy's ability to grow will be impaired. **********''Let's not presume that the ideal outcome is more regulation,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********Under pressure from members of the committee to explain why Long-Term Capital's troubles justified help from the Fed in arranging a rescue plan, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. McDonough said no taxpayer money was used and that the case should not be seen as a precedent for future intervention by the Fed in the marketplace. **********Indeed, they said, although the Fed brought all the players together, the deal that emerged stripped Long-Term Capital's owners of all but 10 percent of their stakes. **********In the long run, Mr. Greenspan said, the plan ''may well work to reduce the ultimate losses to the original owners of L.T.C.M., but that was a byproduct, perhaps unfortunate, of the process.'' **********He acknowledged, however, that the case raised questions about what economists call moral hazard -- the idea that rescuing investors from a bet gone bad encourages further overly risky bets. **********But wiping out investors through a forced liquidation of the sort that Long-Term Capital faced would have made investors perhaps too frightened to take risks, Mr. Greenspan said, hurting the economy's ability to grow. As a result, he suggested, it is appropriate to intervene in the markets to stem potential panic. **********''Risk-taking is a necessary condition for wealth creation,'' he said. ''The optimum degree of risk aversion should be governed by rational judgments about the marketplace, not the fear flowing from fire sales.'' **********Representative Maurice Hinchey, Democrat of New York, pressed Mr. Greenspan on his opposition to further regulation of exotic securities called derivatives, which are essentially bets on the direction of stocks, bonds, currencies and interest rates. **********Mr. Greenspan replied that the ''degree of supervision and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system.'' He supported language in a spending bill now before Congress that would postpone efforts by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop tighter regulations on derivatives. **********But Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, later told the committee that not requiring more disclosure from banks and investment firms of their derivatives positions could imperil market stability."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/10/world/italy-s-center-left-government-is-toppled-by-one-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1998-10-10", "snippet": "Prime Min Romano Prodi's center-left government loses confidence vote, 313-312, suggesting return to chronic political instability in Italy; Prodi resigns but will remain in charge as caretaker until new government is formed; photo (M)", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy's Center-Left Government Is Toppled by One Vote", "print_headline": "Italy's Center-Left Government Is Toppled by One Vote", "body_text": " **********By only one vote, the center-left Prime Minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament today and was toppled from power. **********The collapse of his Government after two and a half years, the second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the chronic political instability that marked Italy for decades had sprung back to life. **********Though obliged to tender his resignation, Mr. Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker Prime Minister until a new government is formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even if he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks, clouding decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in Kosovo. **********NATO military planners preparing for possible air strikes against Yugoslavia had expected to use key air bases in Italy. In his weakened position, Mr. Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve NATO strikes. He will have similar problems passing the 1999 budget, which is necessary before Italy can cut its lending rates, a requirement for joining the single European monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1. **********Immediately after today's vote of 313 to 312, in a tense and at times raucous session, Mr. Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to submit his resignation and discuss his options. In the coming days Mr. Scalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to ascertain whether Mr. Prodi has enough lingering support to try to form a new government. If not, the President is expected to turn to another political leader. **********If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged into early elections. But parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push things that far, for opinion polls suggest that voters are no more enamored of the center-right opposition parties than they are of the governing majority. **********Mr. Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western allies as a down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge. By raising taxes, lowering interest rates and reducing the deficit, Italy met the requirements for membership in the euro last spring, a feat that only a year before was considered impossible by German and French economists. **********Mr. Prodi was helped by a healthy global economy and a rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, who feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to third-world status. **********But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform of a political system that is inherently fragile. There are more than 40 parties in Italy, and the Government's efforts to amend the Constitution to introduce a two-party system failed. **********''Unless the Italian political system changes, Italy is condemned to political instability,'' said Sergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. ''The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never happen as long as the government is hanging from a thread.'' **********In 1996 Mr. Prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions mostly made up of Catholic moderates and leftists. He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house. And that alliance, fragile from the beginning, finally frayed to the breaking point this week. The hard-line leader of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition. **********That position drove the moderate wing of Communist Refounding, worried that a vote against Mr. Prodi would open the doors to a center-right government, to split away. But the 20-odd deputies who defied Mr. Bertinotti were not enough to squeeze Mr. Prodi through. **********''I am not bitter,'' Mr. Prodi said moments after his defeat. ''Even today I received a lot of support.'' **********In the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a member of the coalition. ''They have won by the treachery of one single person,'' Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Mr. Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who heads that party, said Mr. Liotta would be expelled. **********Mr. Prodi has often said he would not govern with any other majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996. But throughout his tenure, he was forced to seek temporary alliances to push through major policy decisions. **********He struggled to the last to try to keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, in an effort to woo more moderate Communists to his side, the Prime Minister, a staunch ally of the United States, warned that he would oppose a NATO strike aimed at stopping Serbian violence in Kosovo unless the United Nations Security Council approved the attack.

It was exhaustion. Not only was she acting in the play and running the box office, but she had designed the sets and posters and, with a teacher, sewn the costumes. **********It was a lesson for a teen-ager intent on a career in the theater: You can't do it all. **********There were more false starts before she learned to channel her ambition toward what came naturally -- costume design -- and years of work before she hit the big time designing costumes in 1991 for the Broadway musical ''Miss Saigon'' and later for three Woody Allen films, most recently ''Celebrity,'' with Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis, which opens in theaters on Friday. **********In high school, she often entered talent contests but never won. ''But I always had the best costumes,'' she said. ''Lots of crinolines.'' **********At the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island, she told the chairman of the theater department she wanted to be a director. ''He told me to be something else,'' Ms. Benzinger said. ''He offered to put me in charge of the costume department.'' **********The same professor also instilled pragmatism. In one class, she said, he distributed a map of Broadway theaters that pinpointed all the neighborhood delis, so students would know where to order coffee. **********After a fight with her college boyfriend, Ms. Benzinger dropped out of school in 1978, a few months shy of graduation, hoping to get a job at the Studio Arena Theater, a professional house in Buffalo. Told there were no openings, she decided to apply Woody Allen's maxim that 80 percent of success is showing up. ''I went to Studio Arena and said I was there for the work-study program, even though I knew they didn't have one,'' she recalled. ''Fortunately, someone in the costume shop had quit that morning, and they assumed I'd been sent as his replacement.'' **********The job paid only $50 a week but was rewarding in other ways. ''One week I was coffee girl for Tennessee Williams,'' she said. ''The producer warned me not to let him out of the building before lunch or else we'd never see him again.'' **********By the end of that season, Ms. Benzinger had done shows with famous costume designers like Theoni V. Aldredge, Florence Klotz and Jane Greenwood. **********After the final curtain in Buffalo, Ms. Benzinger would finally get to the Great White Way. Ms. Greenwood secured her a job at the Brooks Van Horn Costume Company in Manhattan, where she worked as a shopper -- gathering materials for costume designers -- at the regal salary of $109 a week. Two years later, Ms. Aldredge hired her as an assistant, at $500 a week. Over the next decade, Ms. Benzinger worked with Ms. Aldredge on shows like ''La Cage aux Folles,'' ''42d Street,'' ''Dreamgirls,'' ''Annie 2,'' ''Merlin,'' ''Chess'' and ''Blithe Spirit.'' **********Just mentioning the ''Blithe Spirit'' revival, starring Richard Chamberlain and Geraldine Page, makes Ms. Benzinger cringe. **********''I ruined my feet because of Geraldine Page,'' she recalled. ''It was midnight and there weren't any shoemakers open, and Geraldine's boots had to be stretched by morning. I soaked athletic socks in alcohol, put them on my feet and then laced the boots up very tightly and slept in them.'' **********Costume design can demand other spontaneous acts of creativity. On the set of ''Ghostbusters,'' one of a few movies that Ms. Benzinger and Ms. Aldredge worked on, the director gave Ms. Benzinger an hour to produce weathered-looking leather jackets. ''I went down to Eighth Street and bought them right off people's backs,'' she said. **********MS. BENZINGER set out on her own in 1991 and soon got her big break. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, had liked her work and asked her to design costumes for ''Miss Saigon.'' She would receive design credit, a fee and royalties for as long as the musical ran. (It's still running.) **********''Miss Saigon'' made her enough money to buy a spacious loft in TriBeCa but was no guarantee of future success. Her next job was designing costumes for ''Ain't Broadway Grand,'' which turned out to be anything but. It closed after two weeks. **********Perhaps it was just as well. ''I was totally drained,'' she said. ''When you work on a show, it's 24-hour days, seven days a week. You have no life.'' **********To get away from it all, she volunteered to assist her brother-in-law, a veterinarian in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. ''I loved it,'' she said. ''The day had a beginning and an end. And I didn't have a director or choreographer coming up to me and saying, 'I really think that the dog should look like this.' '' **********But she would be gone before the end of tick season. The production designer Santo Loquasto tracked her down as she was organizing heartworm vaccinations and invited her to meet with Mr. Allen to design  costumes for ''Deconstructing Harry.'' That led to the jobs on the other Allen films. **********She spent last summer designing costumes for the musical ''Mirette'' at the not-for-profit Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. She acknowledged that her pay of $5,000 didn't even cover expenses, but said she couldn't care less. **********''They give me the freedom to design whatever I want,'' she said, adding with a laugh, ''It's an investment in restoring my sanity after doing movies or a Broadway show.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/08/world/roger-vivier-is-dead-at-90-raised-heels-to-new-heights.html": {"writer_name": "Enid Nemy", "pub_date": "1998-10-08", "snippet": "Roger Vivier, leading shoe designer whose innovations in heel and toe shapes changed silhouette of women's shoes, dies at age 90; photo (M)", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Roger Vivier Is Dead at 90; Raised Heels to New Heights", "print_headline": "Roger Vivier Is Dead at 90; Raised Heels to New Heights", "body_text": " **********Roger Vivier, a leading shoe designer whose innovations in heel and toe shapes changed the silhouette of women's shoes, died on Friday at his home in Toulouse, France.

He had studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and then served an apprenticeship at a shoe factory owned by a relative. **********Elsa Schiaparelli was the first couturier to recognize the unique Vivier talent and in 1937 commissioned him to design shoes for her collection. He came to the United States in the late 30's and soon entered into an association with Herman Delman, the American designer. **********Their relationship continued until 1955, and was renewed for a short period between 1992 and 1994 when Vivier shoes for Delman were sold at prestigious stores, including Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. **********Mr. Vivier was also involved in the retail business at various times. His first shop opened in Paris in 1937, the same year his designs for Schiaparelli gave him international exposure. **********He opened a salon across from Mr. Dior in 1963, managed by his collaborator, the late Michel Brodsky, where a two-hour fitting for one pair of shoes was not unusual. Ms. Dietrich, who lived nearby, was reported to visit the shop almost every day. **********The boutique continued until the mid-70's, when Mr. Vivier moved to a castle in the Dordogne region of France and designed shoes for the Japanese market. Another boutique opened on Madison Avenue in the 80's and a shop in Paris in the mid-90's. **********Mr. Vivier continued working at his craft until his death. Although there was almost a decade when the Vivier name faded from the forefront of fashion, a new generation of admirers emerged in 1985, when an exhibition of his work was held in New York. **********There are collections of his shoes in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in both the Musee de la Mode et du Costume and the Musee des Arts de la Mode in Paris. **********He is survived by his companion, Gerard Benoit-Vivier of Airoux, France, whom he adopted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/business/international-business-brazil-s-economic-half-steps-president-eases-market.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Schemo", "pub_date": "1998-08-01", "snippet": "Aggressive program announced last fall by Pres Henrique Cardoso to protect Brazil from ravages of Asian economic crisis has largely fallen by wayside as October election approaches; Cardoso was hailed by finance experts for doubling interest rates...", "word_count": 1320, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Brazil's Economic Half-Steps; President Eases Market Rigors", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Brazil's Economic Half-Steps; President Eases Market Rigors", "body_text": " **********Last fall, as the wave of financial crises surging through Asia threatened to engulf emerging markets around the world, the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, appeared to be taking swift, decisive action to distance his country from the trouble. **********He doubled interest rates to 43 percent, a move intended to protect the real, Brazil's currency. And he announced a package of 51 measures to raise $18 billion in Government revenue and to cut costs, in part by dismissing more than 30,000 civil servants, freezing public-employee wages and clearing the rosters of dead pensioners whose survivors, conveniently, failed to notify the Government. **********It was months before Mr. Cardoso would begin his campaign for re-election, and Wall Street hailed Brazil's decisiveness at a time of waffling, mud slinging and excuses from Asian leaders unable to confront their own countries' structural problems. **********But as the October presidential election gets closer, the tough talk of last year has disappeared, and the promises of Civil Service and Social Security changes that backed the fiscal-stabilization program four years ago remain half-done. Though Brazil is still vulnerable to the strains and threats from emerging markets half a world away, the federal Government in Brasilia has ceased moves to cut spending. **********Of the 51 austerity measures, only those that involved raising revenue were enacted, while layoffs and other cost-cutting measures were either watered down or abandoned. Even the crackdown on fraudulent pensioners has collapsed. **********Eager to make up for a series of political gaffes in recent months, the President renounced some of the measures as ''unnecessary evils,'' and instead raised Civil Service wages at a cost of more than $400 million this year and an estimated $2 billion in the coming years. He spent more than $5 billion to spur the construction of low-cost housing, and opened the tap for billions in agricultural credits. **********Faced with polls that at one point showed him tied with for his leftist rival for the presidency, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, Mr. Cardoso also relaxed the pressure on Government agencies to reduce spending for the rest of the year, saying they could spend money on the basis of projected, rather than actual revenue. The expected cost? More than $4 billion. **********With official unemployment running at 8.2 percent, sharply higher than the year before, the President pledged that creating jobs would be a priority during a second administration, unlike in the first. **********''They've come down off their high horse and seen what the polls were saying,'' said David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia, who writes the newsletter Brazil Focus. Indeed, Mr. Cardoso is again more comfortably ahead in voter surveys, and most analysts expect him to win the required majority in the first round of balloting. **********Mr. Fleischer and others credit the Brazilian President with acting quickly to contain the effects of the Asian crisis. [Wednesday's auction of Telebras, which brought the Government $19 billion for its controlling stake in the national telecommunications system, showed that investors remain bullish on the country's medium-  and long-term prospects.] **********Indeed, Brazil receives the most direct foreign investment of any emerging market. **********This all has created a certain euphoria about Brazil's prospects, but analysts stress that the nation's economic health has suffered with the President's failure to follow through. In part because of the sharp increase in interest rates, the budget deficit climbed to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product, with the deficit for April nearly 80 percent higher than that for April 1997. **********''A lot of the measures were 'for the English to see,' '' said Alexandre Barros, an economic consultant, using an expression dating back to the 1800's, when Brazil, deeply in debt to England, distracted its creditors by pledging to turn over customs revenue, which had been falsely inflated. **********Despite the pledges to outsiders, Mr. Barros said, the Government has increased rather than cut spending since November. ''The Government did a lot, but the lot that it did was not enough, especially with the deficit,'' he said. **********In a recent interview in Brasilia, Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged that the austerity measures President Cardoso promoted last fall were ''absolutely essential'' to shoring up Brazil's standing at the time. Though they were not all carried out, he said, ''we showed that we were firmly committed to continuing to move forward with the real.'' **********With the country's foreign-exchange reserves at nearly $71 billion, after falling to $52 billion when the Government was forced to defend the currency last fall, Mr. Malan argued that Brazil was now ''in a better position,'' and he called a devaluation ''out of the question.'' The real, which trades within an exchange-rate band, is selling at 1.163 to the dollar, down from 1.10 last November. **********The economic and financial restructuring effort known here as the Real Plan began four years ago. It proceeded from his time as Finance Minister in the previous administration, reducing inflation to less than 5 percent this year from quadruple digits at its worst stage. And it has helped lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty, in part by broadening access to credit. Before the effects of the Asian crisis spread, the sales of cars, appliances and other consumer goods had mushroomed in this country. **********But the plan required sharp changes to modernize the economy: privatizing state industries, removing obstacles to foreign investment, cutting Government payrolls and Social Security expenses, and dismantling obstacles to the dismissal of workers. **********Privatizations and other revenue-producing measures have taken off, while more difficult efforts to reduce Social Security benefits or Civil Service rolls have either stalled or been approved but not yet enacted. Special-interest groups like judges and politicians have maneuvered to maintain relatively lavish pensions, for example, making it politically harder to demand sacrifices from ordinary workers. The last ballot on Social Security reform failed by two votes. **********David Rothkopf, president of the Newmarket Company, an investment firm in Washington, reflected on Brazil's defeat in the world soccer finals by France and remarked: ''There is a growing sense that the World Cup loss might not be the biggest disappointment Brazil faces this year. They are not looking like they'll be able to deal with some of the scenarios that might come along.'' **********Those could include another round of devaluations in Asian currencies, an eventual collapse in Russia or a ballooning domestic trade deficit. And because Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay are linked in a regional alliance known as Mercosur, a devaluation in Brazil might well have a domino effect. **********Even analysts like Ernest W. Brown, a senior economist for Latin America with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who praises the Brazilian Government for strides in privatizing state industries and reforming government, acknowledge that investors view emerging markets in general more skeptically. Morgan Stanley forecasts 1.5 percent growth here this year, while others predict no growth. In July, the investment house lowered its expectations for growth in 1999 to 3.5 percent from 4.9 percent. **********Mr. Brown blamed the Government's ''failure to rein in fiscal red ink'' for the dimmer forecast. ''From that perspective, they've certainly come up short in terms of Wall Street's expectations,'' he said. **********Analysts are predicting that the jolt President Cardoso received from the polls in June will not alter the direction of Brazil's economics, but will spur him to think more about selling his economic changes to voters. And as fewer state entities remain to be sold off, this argument goes, pressure will build for delivering on the promised reforms in a second term. **********Mr. Cardoso's popularity plunged after he publicly called workers who opposed making the minimum retirement age 65 ''bums.'' A few months earlier, he derided his countrymen as ''hillbillies.'' The attacks reinforced a growing perception of presidential arrogance and insensitivity. **********''The poor start working early and they die early,'' Mr. Barros said. Requiring all Brazilians to work until 65 further concentrates wealth among the upper classes. ''It's taking the income from the poor and giving it to the rich,'' he said. ''People don't know if the Government thought about that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/04/world/clinton-china-overview-clinton-optimistic-china-s-future-he-heads-home.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-04", "snippet": "Pres Clinton, in news conference that closes his nine-day trip to China, calls Pres Jiang Zemin a visionary leader who could be the figure who leads China to democracy; Clinton also praises Premier Zhu Rongji, architect of China's current economic...", "word_count": 1331, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLINTON OPTIMISTIC ON CHINA'S FUTURE AS HE HEADS HOME", "print_headline": "CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW; CLINTON OPTIMISTIC ON CHINA'S FUTURE AS HE HEADS HOME", "body_text": " **********President Clinton today called Jiang Zemin, the President of China, a visionary leader who could be the figure who leads China to democracy. **********Mr. Clinton, in a news conference that closed his nine-day trip to China, gave a vigorous personal endorsement of the Chinese President, saying Mr. Jiang has the imagination needed to transform China from a single-party Communist state to a pluralistic democracy. **********The President also praised Premier Zhu Rongji, the architect of China's current economic policies, saying, ''There's a very good chance that China has the right leadership at the right time.'' **********Mr. Clinton has sounded increasingly hopeful about China's future as his trip progressed, offering his most optimistic assessment of the nation's political prospects just before departing to return to Washington to celebrate Independence Day. **********But his words could come back to haunt him should repression in China harden, leaving Mr. Clinton open to the charges that he was taken in by a seemingly open Mr. Jiang. **********Asked whether there will ever be democracy in China, Mr. Clinton said, ''Oh, yes, I believe there can be, and I believe there will be. **********''And what I would like to see is the present Government -- headed by this President and this Premier, who are clearly committed to reform -- ride the wave of change and take China fully into the 21st century and basically dismantle the resistance to it,'' he added. ''I believe they are.'' **********The President answered questions for 43 minutes, most of them on his trip to China but others touching on the troubled Japanese economy, the prospect of violence in Ireland this weekend and the continuing ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo. **********Mr. Clinton offered an overwhelmingly positive summation of his five-city journey through China. **********He said that profound differences remain between China and the United States on questions of individual liberty, and he warned that powerful forces still oppose change here. **********But he defended his engagement with the Chinese leadership as the course most likely to yield progress on a range of issues from human rights to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. **********The coming months and years will tell whether these few days in early summer were the beginning of a positive new epoch in relations between the United States and China, or merely a sideways step in an ambiguous relationship. There are groups in both countries with a political investment in confrontation rather than cooperation. **********Whatever Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang say or do as their nations' leaders, they are but one part of a complex interplay between two diverse and dynamic societies, one that will be shaped as much by transnational corporations, the media, religious groups and even the Internet. **********Mr. Clinton tried to reflect that diversity in his appearances here, meeting with villagers, middle-class homeowners, young entrepreneurs, scholars and students. **********Absent from the President's schedule was any session with outspoken opponents of the Government. Mr. Clinton defended that decision today, saying he sought to deal with human rights concerns in China ''in a way most likely to yield progress.'' **********''I did my best to meet with people who represented all elements of Chinese society,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The decisions I made on this trip -- and, I remind you, the first trip by an American President in a decade -- about with whom to meet and how to handle it were basically designed, were based on my best judgment about what would be most effective in expanding human rights.'' **********White House officials have said that Mr. Clinton did not want to risk retaliation against those who met with him and that he believed that pressing Mr. Jiang to release groups of political prisoners would be more effective than a theatrical encounter with dissidents. **********Mr. Clinton, looking weary from a grueling schedule, said in his opening remarks that his trip to China -- the longest of his Presidency to a single country -- had shown him ''the glory of China's past in Xian, the vibrancy of its present in Beijing and the promise of its future in Shanghai and Hong Kong.'' **********''I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in China, as well as the distance still to be traveled,'' the President said in the news conference, held in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt hotel here. **********He clearly was struck by Hong Kong's wealth and vitality, and said the region -- which reverted to Chinese control just a year ago -- could be the model for China's development. **********He gave his most extensive assessment of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu, praising them in elaborate language. **********The President said of Mr. Jiang: ''After I met with him for the first time, I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming the leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because he's a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigor for his age, or indeed for any age. And I think he has a quality that is profoundly important at this moment in history when there's so much change going on. He has a good imagination. He has vision. He can visualize. He can imagine a future that is different from the present.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that Mr. Jiang has constituencies who oppose him and who distrust American motives in engaging China. **********To them, Mr. Clinton said: ''I hope more of them understand that America wishes China well, that we are not bent on containing China, and that our human rights policy is not an excuse for some larger strategic motive. It's what we really believe. We believe it's morally right, and we believe it's best for them as a practical matter over the long run.'' **********In response to another question, he noted that ''democracy is a universal aspiration,'' an answer to Mr. Jiang's assertion that China's history and culture have led it to different definitions of human rights from those accepted in the West. **********The President welcomed the recent release of several well-known dissidents, but said that he now looked to Beijing to release whole classes of prisoners. He particularly cited the 150 people still held on charges related to the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations that were brutally put down by the Government in June 1989. He also called on Beijing to release an unknown number of prisoners held for political activities that the Government has declared to be no longer criminal. **********He said that in his talks with Mr. Jiang he had raised charges that China imposes abortion on women to enforce China's one-child policy. ''They all say the same thing,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They say that that is not Chinese policy and it violates Chinese policy.'' Mr. Clinton added that his view was that ''there may be insufficient monitoring of what is being done beyond the capital.'' **********Mr. Clinton offended many in Taiwan this week when he repeated Beijing's preferred formulation of American policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. But he defended his decision, saying that he had not changed the substance of American policy, which is to oppose Taiwanese independence and support peaceful reunification with China. **********''I believe I did the right thing,'' Mr. Clinton said. **********In response to a question from a reporter from The Irish Times, Mr. Clinton deplored the recent burnings of churches in Ireland and called for high-level talks among Roman Catholic, Protestant and British authorities in advance of annual sectarian marches set for this weekend that in the past have led to violence. **********Mr. Clinton offered tempered praise for a package of banking and financial reforms announced by Tokyo in recent days. He said that Japan's economy had substantial underlying strength and expressed hope that the recession there would bottom out soon and growth would resume ''in a reasonable amount of time.'' **********On Kosovo, the President offered nothing beyond a hope that Belgrade would show restraint. ''There is some uncertainty about who is willing and who is not willing to even negotiate about it,'' Mr. Clinton said.

For much of his career, Mr. Zabludovsky defined what most Mexicans would -- and would not -- know about what was happening in their country. **********Until recently his reports were studiously loyal to the Government, which has been dominated by a single party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. **********Mr. Zabludovsky retired tonight, and Televisa executives decided that his 45-minute news broadcast, called ''24 Hours,'' would retire with him. **********Mr. Zabludovsky is as admired within the political establishment as he is despised by many in the opposition whom he has belittled over the years. But viewers on all sides agree that his departure marks the end of an era in Mexican journalism, when Televisa served as a pillar of the monolithic PRI, a party so powerful that it could force journalists to censor their own reports in its favor. **********As he prepared this morning for his last show, Mr. Zabludovsky was surprisingly candid about the limitations under which he had worked. **********''For many years Mexico lived under a virtual single-party system,'' he said in an interview. ''There was no legislature or judicial power to balance the President. Our margin of action was limited by these circumstances.'' **********He recalled constant phone calls from the Interior Ministry, the agency that enforces the Mexican President's political control, asking him to play down unfavorable developments and highlight Government gains. ''They didn't issue orders,'' he said. ''They gave advice, suggestions, requests. We had to observe these requests to a considerable degree.'' **********Mr. Zabludovsky said he had often been uncomfortable with the official pressure but ackowledged that he had rarely rejected it. **********His employer, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, who owned Televisa, publicly and repeatedly declared his allegiance to the PRI and insisted that the network's news programs reflect his preference. Mr. Azcarraga died last year. **********''There were certain institutions that he would not touch,'' Mr. Zabludovsky said of his strong-willed boss. ''He supported the PRI, and he said it publicly. I had to follow the directives I received from the president of the company.'' **********But he said Mr. Azcarraga had never obliged him to back the PRI personally. **********''He didn't insist that I be a PRI-ista,'' he said, using the term for a PRI follower. ''And I am not and never have been. Within the rules of the game, I made an effort to give as much information as I could.'' **********Sergio Aguayo, a social scientist, said of Mr. Zabludovsky, ''There is no doubt about his professionalism and intelligence, and there is no doubt that he always sought to adapt to the interests of the system.'' Mr. Aguayo, who has been a persistent critic of Mr. Zabludovsky, added: ''His worst failings were his omissions. He remained silent at crucial moments.'' **********In a reporting career that spanned five decades, Mr. Zabludovsky had many triumphs. He marched into Havana alongside Fidel Castro in 1959 during the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship. **********In 1985 an earthquake tore apart Televisa's central studios in downtown Mexico City, killing more than 90 employees. Mr. Zabludovsky described the devastation on live radio for six hours that morning while the television network struggled to get back on the air. When the Government tried to conceal the death toll, he refused to go along. **********His low points came in his coverage of the presidential elections in 1988 and 1994, when he gave PRI candidates generous air time and affectionate commentary while virtually excluding opposition contenders. **********Yet Mr. Zabludovsky is going out on a high note. In a poll published this weekend by the independent news paper Reforma, 56 percent of those questioned in Mexico City wanted him to continue to lead the news broadcast. Although the competition, TV Azteca, has risen quickly, Mr. Zabludovsky's program still leads the ratings most nights. **********In the most recent national elections, in July 1997, he showed that he could adapt to a new democratic opening by providing coverage generally regarded as more balanced than TV Azteca's. **********Mr. Zabludovsky, who will be 70 in May, said he had decided to leave ''24 Hours'' to free himself from the grind of a daily news program. In the past year he has learned he has three different types of cancer. A minor skin cancer and a melanoma were removed in five operations, and a month ago doctors told him he had prostate cancer. **********''Tonight will be our finest moment,'' he said. ''I am finishing the program when I am in complete possession of my mental faculties, when I can still go on to do other things.'' On Tuesday he will leave for Cuba to cover the visit of Pope John Paul II for Televisa. **********On his last day as anchor, he had lost none of his aplomb. In the middle of the last show, he took a phone call from President Ernesto Zedillo, who praised him as ''a very special witness and narrator of Mexico's recent history.'' **********Before a studio crowded with friends and staff, many of them weeping, Mr. Zabludovsky gave a typically terse farewell: ''24 Hours ends today.

But today they had only bad news to deliver. **********They had not been able to find anyone willing to donate a coffin for Ennie Gambushe's daughter, Mercy, who had died of AIDS. Nor had they come up with the $18 needed for a traditional burial. **********Mrs. Gambushe, 64, with chronic arthritis that makes it difficult for her to stand up, absorbed the blow without saying a word. It was hardly her only concern: outside, dirty and dressed in rags, were the 15 grandchildren, none older than 12, whom she was now responsible for. **********Years after many other sub-Saharan countries, South Africa has finally begun to see its people die from AIDS. In almost every cluster of desperately poor huts tucked into the rolling hills of KwaZulu/ Natal Province, the slow wasting fatal disease that few will admit to is wreaking its havoc. **********The epidemic in this country is now one of the fastest growing in the world. Experts say South Africa -- protected by apartheid's isolationism from major exposure to infection, and with a health system better than any other on the continent -- had a unique opportunity to prevent the kind of explosion of AIDS cases that has ravaged the rest of Africa. **********But in the early 1990's the country was in the grip of negotiating a peaceful transition from white supremacist rule. With the possibility of civil war looming, no one paid much attention to halting unprotected sex. Even now, many experts say, the Government's efforts to combat the epidemic have been slow and marred by scandal. **********Today almost three million South Africans -- about 12 percent of all adults -- are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, more than double the number only three years ago. The rate of infection is highest, at 20 percent, among women in their 20's. **********Experts say that it may be only a few years before South Africa's infection rates will equal those of its neighbors Zimbabwe and Botswana, where 25 percent of all adults are infected. **********For the time being, experts say the virus is most prevalent among South Africa's poor blacks. **********In some parts of Africa, the epidemic first roared through the urban elite. They had the money to travel and tended to have more sexual partners. But in South Africa it is poor blacks -- because they search the country looking for jobs and often have sexual partners in their villages and where they work -- who have been hardest hit. **********What impact the virus will have on South Africa's economy, the largest on the continent, remains an open question. But there is little doubt that it will bring new levels of misery to the very poor. **********That is already evident in places like Izingolweni, rural areas where the way of life was for decades dictated by apartheid laws. The able-bodied went off to work, forbidden to take their families with them. But it is here that they came to marry, to celebrate holidays or to return home when they were ill, old or dying. **********Rural Scenes Of Ghastly Neglect **********Down the road from Mrs. Gambushe is an 11-year-old girl who alone nursed her dying parents last year, barely able to keep them clean and fed as their bodies, worn down by H.I.V., shriveled from dysentery and tuberculosis. **********There is a dying mother of nine who struggles with a husband who beats her because he believes she gave him the disease. **********And there is a young man, rail thin, who worked for a while in the city of Durban but who has come home to die now. He is not accepted by his family, because they suspect that he has AIDS and are afraid that they, too, will catch it. **********Though the young man is allowed his hut nearby, he must tend to himself. Many days he is too weak to fetch water from the river and lies in filth. **********Most of the time, such people receive few services. **********The South Coast Hospice originally began as a nonprofit organization working from a small house in a white neighborhood, catering largely to middle-class people dying of cancer in the seaside town of Port Shepstone. But 18 months ago the group began trying to reach out to the black population dying of AIDS. **********At first the hospice workers concentrated on delivering painkillers as it had for whites. But soon they were carting food, clothing and whatever else they could into the hills. **********Taking the Diagnosis Into the Grave **********''What good does it do to bring painkillers when you find that the care giver in the household doesn't have the strength to roll the patient over, because she is starving,'' said Kathleen Defilippi, the director of the nonprofit group. ''So we didn't want to, but we had to get involved in handing out food parcels and whatever else was needed.'' **********Mrs. Gambushe's difficulty in providing a coffin for her daughter is not unusual, the hospice workers said. Many these days are buried wrapped only in sheets, despite the deeply held Zulu belief that those who are not put to rest properly will come back to haunt their families. **********''A lot of times, we even have to give them the sheets,'' said Judy Ndaba, who visits patients four days a week. The fifth day, she receives counseling, as do all of the workers, because what they see is so draining. **********As the workers try to tend to patients, they must often do so without acknowledging that the patients have AIDS. Here as elsewhere in the country, patients are too ashamed and too frightened to tell anyone their diagnosis. **********Often enough, they die with their secret. Mrs. Gambushe, for instance, does not know that Mercy died of AIDS. Mercy did not want to tell her, and the health workers are bound to follow her wishes. Another of Mrs. Gambushe's daughters died last year, and she does not know why. It is the children of both daughters whom Mrs. Gambushe is now looking after. **********Another patient, Nomusa Dlamini, who has been ill for three years, has also not told her family that she has AIDS. She does not fear only for herself. She worries that if her sisters knew, they would be too frightened to take care of her two young children after she dies. **********Typically, even wives are afraid to tell their husbands they are infected with H.I.V. Because the women, run down by the hard lives they lead and the many children they bear, are most likely to show symptoms first, husbands will not believe that they have been faithful and sometimes throw them out of the house or beat them like Esther Xolo. Her husband now believes that their last two children are not his. **********On a recent visit, Ms. Xolo burst into tears, begging the workers to talk to her husband, who has taken to living on his own and hoarding the food the workers take to the family. **********Even though the disease is often not acknowledged, the villages have seen enough AIDS so that suspicion runs high. **********Some patients live in virtual isolation because of it. Vusumuzi Tabhu, who has told no one he is suffering from AIDS, has gotten little help from his family since he came home last year. On a recent day he greeted the workers will a grin. He had been feeling better in the last few days and had done his laundry. **********They teased him about having found a girlfriend, an exchange that he clearly enjoyed. But the workers say he suffers a great deal. Even when the workers bring him food, family members often take it from him. They, too, are hungry, and he is far too weak to stop them. **********''You sometimes go into the household and you see that the person is isolated,'' said Dr. Terry Gilpin, the director of nearby Murchison Hospital. ''You'll see that the sick person's plate and utensils are in the corner away from everyone else. You see it a lot. People are ignorant about the disease.'' **********Murchison, like many other hospitals in the province, is already overwhelmed by the numbers of AIDS patients. Most nights, 15 patients sleep on the floor. While infection rates are rising throughout South Africa, the hardest-hit area is KwaZulu/ Natal, which includes a port city and many truck routes connecting it to neighboring countries. **********What Lies Ahead? 'Great Misery' **********Since there are no similar models to study, economists say it is impossible to predict what is likely to happen to South Africa's economy. **********Some predict that the bigger corporations will be able to adapt to a decline in the labor pool. Most are already in the process of shedding employees as they mechanize, computerize and in general try to become more competitive. **********In addition, the growing mobility of the international labor pool means that South Africa could go outside the country to fill gaps that arise. **********But already it is clear that the measure of hardship in this society will rise sharply. Young people will be dying at a time when they are usually contributing to a family's income. And many will be leaving children behind. **********''The jury is still out on what the macro level impact will be,'' said Alan Whiteside, an economist at the University of Natal in Durban who studies such issues. ''But at the micro level you will see great misery. ' **********Despite South Africa's relatively advanced public health services, the country is still struggling financially and the Government is not even discussing providing treatment for AIDS itself. Few of the private medical insurance companies will pay either. **********Peter Bassey of the National Association of People Living With H.I.V./AIDS says fewer than 1 percent of South Africa's infected are being treated with life-prolonging drugs like AZT. And most of those are paying for the drug themselves. **********Nor are there any national programs to try to block the transmission from mother to child, either by offering AZT to infected pregnant women or by providing formula so they can avoid transmission through breast feeding. **********The government has made progress, though, in dispensing condoms -- about 140 million last year -- and in offering treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases, which helps reduce the spread of AIDS. **********Also, about one-tenth of the country's secondary school teachers have been trained to teach youngsters about the disease and how to avoid it. **********Still, the Government's two most visible steps against AIDS were both headline-making fiascos. **********The first was an ill-fated traveling musical, ''Sarafina II,'' meant to warn the illiterate about the dangers of AIDS. As soon as it opened, AIDS experts called some of its dialogue dangerously inaccurate and its message unclear. **********The Health Minister And Her 2 Fiascoes **********It then turned out that the show had cost a relative fortune -- nearly $3.3 million. Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma commissioned a friend to write it, bypassed bidding rules to give him the job and then lied to Parliament about the whole affair. **********Then last year, Dr. Zuma announced that South African scientists had made a major breakthrough in the search for an AIDS cure. She invited researchers who claimed to have discovered the miracle cure -- a drug called Virodene administered by a skin patch -- to bypass the Medicines Control Council, the equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, and take some of their cured patients before the Cabinet to plead for funding. **********Medical experts, including the control council, were aghast when they found out that human trials had been performed secretly, especially when they learned that the Virodene contained a poisonous solvent. Since then, Dr. Zuma has dismantled the council. She continues to back Virodene research. **********These days the South Coast Hospice workers visit more than 300 patients a month, though they have yet to secure financing for next year and may have to shut down. The workers are particularly worried about the fate of the children they see. **********The 11-year-old girl who nursed her parents, Kugu Sengane, spent most of last year alone with them and her toddler brother. Her relatives showed up only in the last few months -- ready, it seems, to take over the two shacks her parent built. These days the workers are worried about the girl. She seems afraid to speak in front of her aunts and appears to do most of the housework. **********There is also little possibility that the 15 children in Mrs. Gambushe's care will go to school anytime soon. They will all be living on her pension now, less than $80 a month. The school fees and mandatory books and uniforms amount to about $120 a year for each child. **********Sitting motionless on the straw mat inside her virtually empty house, Mrs. Gambushe answered questions about the future in a monotone. **********''I don't know what I will do now,'' she said.

Its relentless growth over the years has made it a key source of profit for G.E. and one of the reasons that the company is famous for making its numbers. But with the tumult abroad and at home causing investors to shy away from financial service concerns, G.E. could be looking for ways to divert attention from this golden goose. **********Speculation is rampant that General Electric will soon announce sweeping changes at the subsidiary. Gary C. Wendt, GE Capital's chief executive and the man largely responsible for its success, is widely expected to leave. In addition to naming new leadership to replace him, General Electric is said to be close to a reorganization of GE Capital that would make it easier to manage and a less visible force on the parent company's bottom line. **********General Electric does not comment on ''rumors and speculation,'' according to Anthony B. Zehnder, a spokesman. **********With about $40 billion in revenue last year, GE Capital is now composed of 28 businesses ranging from credit cards to truck leasing to insurance. Without doubt, though, GE Capital is a hefty contributor to General Electric's overall profit, about 40 percent of net earnings in 1997. **********The talk, among analysts and others who closely watch GE Capital, is that the subsidiary will undergo some sort of shake-up in which it will be split into separate businesses. The expectation is the creation of three distinct units, splitting off the insurance business and dividing the others, perhaps along commercial and consumer lines. **********Some of the businesses, like equipment leasing, may also be folded back into divisions within General Electric. GE Capital Railcar Services, for example, a leasing business, could be combined with transportation system businesses. **********The reorganization may make sense on a lot of levels. Given the current disdain for financial service concerns, out of investors' fear of emerging markets, an economic slowdown and derivatives that go bump in earnings, G.E. may want to de-emphasize that aspect of its business. Although its stock has already suffered -- it is off 22 percent from the July high -- investors are still awarding it a hefty price-earnings multiple just above 28, more than twice that of many insurance companies or money-center banks. It closed yesterday at $75.5625. Microsoft recently surpassed G.E. as the nation's largest company by market value. **********To be sure, the company's smoother-than-silk earnings record accounts for some of that premium. ''G.E. has this pristine growth rate, year after year,'' much of which is due to the cushion afforded a financial services subsidiary, said David W. Tice, a Dallas money manager who tends to cast a skeptical eye on companies. While he concedes that the managers at G.E. are nothing if not smart, ''there is more risk within G.E. than most people give it credit for,'' he said. **********And in an ugly market environment, some critics have been much crueler, calling GE Capital ''a hedge fund in drag,'' as Kathryn M. Welling reported last month in Barron's, which dredges up images of billion-dollar losses. While analysts like Jeffrey Sprague at Salomon Smith Barney have argued that GE Capital does nothing so speculative and is not really vulnerable to disasters in emerging markets, General Electric may want the business to have lower visibility, though a company executive wrote a letter to Barron's defending GE Capital. **********The benefit from all this reshuffling could be that investors and analysts poring over General Electric's financial statements will be less struck by GE Capital's prominence. There would be more contributors to earnings, and some of the existing business lines could have the benefit of some of GE Capital's profits. G.E. may also be hoping that a little reorganization could squeeze more income out of GE Capital, at a time when the parent company can use all the help it can get to keep delivering ever-higher profits. **********There is also Mr. Wendt. Despite his well-publicized role in making GE Capital a roaring success, he is said to have a poor relationship with John F. Welch Jr., the 62-year-old  chairman and chief executive of General Electric. Even though Mr. Wendt's confession, during his ugly divorce proceedings, that he and Mr. Welch were not the best of friends, has helped fuel this talk, people who know both men say they just do not get along very well. Mr. Welch may also be looking for a successor, and many believe that Mr. Wendt is not it. Mr. Wendt did not return phone calls seeking comment. **********One possibility is that Mr. Wendt will move to a high position at a rival financial services company like Chase Manhattan. Chase declined to comment. Mr. Wendt, who recently remarried, could also choose a life of leisure and simply retire. He has said publicly that he has no plans to leave GE Capital, which is based in Stamford, Conn. **********But the real intrigue is about who would succeed Mr. Wendt. While Denis Nayden, GE Capital's current president, may seem like a natural, he could end up with only a piece of the action if GE Capital is carved up. Names that are being bandied about as other executives who would rise in the reshuffling are Michael A. Neal and Michael D. Frazier, both of whom are currently GE Capital executives. **********In order to bring GE Capital a little closer to home, which may also be Mr. Welch's goal, the talk is that General Electric will have the executives report to the company's current chief financial officer, Dennis D. Dammerman. He could also be named as an interim head of the whole group. As the man responsible for the numbers at General Electric, Mr. Dammerman is said to be in Mr. Welch's favor. ''He has tremendous respect on the Street,'' said an executive recruiter, who spoke on the condition that he not be named. **********Rumors always abound at General Electric, but many people believe that change really is afoot, given investor sentiment and the need to replace Mr. Wendt if he leaves. ''We are definitely going through a changing of the guard,'' an analyst said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/10/world/seesaw-arafat-s-up-clinton-and-netanyahu-teeter.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "1998-12-10", "snippet": "Deborah Sontag analysis contends that Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat is in 'his moment of glory' on eve of Pres Clinton's trip to Middle East, while Clinton and Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu both face possibility of eviction from office (M...", "word_count": 1051, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seesaw: Arafat's Up; Clinton and Netanyahu Teeter", "print_headline": "Seesaw: Arafat's Up; Clinton and Netanyahu Teeter", "body_text": " **********As President Clinton prepares to fly into the diplomatic sandstorm of the Middle East, it is not just land borders but political boundaries that have shifted, creating a whole new landscape for the three-sided relationship. **********This time, it is Yasir Arafat who is riding high. The strong, unbudgable Palestinian leader knows that unrest in the West Bank and dissent in Gaza present no serious challenge to his rule. **********This is his moment of glory, the terrorist-turned-elder statesman welcoming the American President -- ''our new partner,'' the official Palestinian newspaper said -- to his very own, eponymous airport, gateway to his future Palestinian state. **********Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, on the other hand, both face the possibility of eviction from office, far more seriously in the Israeli's case. The American President flies out as the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives decides whether to approve articles of impeachment, and Mr. Netanyahu is living on borrowed time until Parliament holds a vote of no confidence in his Government within two weeks. **********Only for Mr. Arafat will peace be the central and indispensable preoccupation. For Mr. Netanyahu, who won but a short-lived reprieve from a Parliament ready to topple him on Monday, the peace plan is the devil that tore asunder his right-wing coalition. He is not about to embrace it, much less carry it out, during the two weeks he fights for his political survival, American Presidential visit, or no. **********And for Mr. Clinton, if he can concentrate, the land-for-security peace plan signed with such great ceremony in the White House in late October, is in danger of becoming a tainted foreign policy achievement. **********If successful, his visit from Saturday to Tuesday, like his efforts at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, could once more distract attention from the scandal that will not go away. If the trip is blemished by the unforgiving political realities of the region, though, the great mediator could end up seeming doubly beleaguered by forces beyond his control. **********Gaza is being scrubbed and Bethlehem repaved in anticipation of Mr. Clinton's visit. Palestinian poster makers are churning out glossy likenesses of the President, rather than the ubiquitous portraits of the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********But even as the Prime Minister's wife, Sara, taste-tests appetizers at the Jerusalem Hilton, Israel is playing the reluctant host. ''Feh,'' the Cabinet says to the trip. Mr. Netanyahu said, shrugging: ''If he wants to come, he should come. If he does not want to come, he should not come.'' **********The trip was Mr. Netanyahu's idea, according to the Americans, but it has backfired on the Prime Minister. He wanted to make sure that the Palestinians lived up to their commitment to amend their charter, eliminating clauses calling for Israel's destruction. Mr. Clinton would preside over a vote of the Palestinian National Council in Gaza, and all the world would hear the Palestinians renounce their former war on Israel. **********But the trip has turned into something that bears the trappings of an official state visit by Israel's top ally to the Palestinian National Authority. And this signals a profound change in the dynamic between the Americans, the Israelis and the Palestinians. Most alarming to Mr. Netanyahu and his Cabinet is the sense that Israel risks losing its special relationship with the United States, and, even worse, that the P.L.O. could someday be on a diplomatic par with them. **********''I see this visit as a not terribly positive moment for Israeli-American relations, just as it is a very positive sign for U.S.-Palestinian relations,'' said Joseph Alpher, director of the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ''We're at the point where the degree and extent of the American coordination over the peace process is as extensive with the P.L.O. as it is with Israel.'' **********Some Israelis see this as a complicated dynamic that reflects poorly on Mr. Netanyahu's diplomatic skills, at a cost to Israel. **********''The problem is not that Clinton and Arafat are developing mutual trust, but that the Americans are getting closer to the Palestinians while they are moving further away from Israel,'' Akiva Eldar, a columnist, said in the newspaper Haaretz today. **********The peace negotiations at the Wye Plantation in Maryland in October took place against the backdrop of domestic politics as well. At that time, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu were seen to be assisting each other. **********The Israelis gave the President the chance to play an important role on the world stage while the transcripts of Monica S. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony were being released. And Mr. Clinton, by proclaiming Mr. Netanyahu a man of courage taking a great political risk, helped force the Labor Party opposition to back him when he returned; to oppose Mr. Netanyahu was to oppose peace. **********But now the American President and the Israeli Prime Minister are no longer allies but mutual threats. Mr. Netanyahu cannot cozy up to Mr. Clinton because the right wing,  which he has two weeks to woo back, will tar him, the initiator, as the inadvertent godfather of the Palestinian state. **********And Mr. Clinton, who had hoped he would be presiding over festivities, is arriving at a new low in Israeli-Palestinian relations, which, if Mr. Netanyahu feels provoked, could end up ballooning into a genuine crisis during his time here. **********The Palestinian National Council may not end up taking what the Israelis consider to be a genuine vote on Monday, the day that Mr. Clinton attends its meeting. In a worst case scenario, this could do more than freeze the agreement; it could sever it. Almost inevitably, Mr. Clinton will be dragged back into the role of mediating an agreement that is already signed. **********For Mr. Netanyahu, the dance of distancing himself from the peace plan will be a tricky one during this visit that is now so inopportunely timed to collide with his battle for survival. But many Israelis see his woes as selfish. **********''Ultimately, the issue is less whether Netanyahu will survive politically, but rather the price that the country will pay,'' David Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for Haaretz, wrote. '' And unless a drastic change is made, the price will likely be to halt the Wye agreement and to hurt U.S.-Israeli relations.'' **********At that point, then, there will be a cost for Mr. Arafat, too, but in the meantime he and his aides are barreling forward, acre by acre."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/19/world/most-chileans-react-moderately-to-arrest.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1998-10-19", "snippet": "Most Chileans react with moderation to arrest of former strongman Gen Augusto Pinochet by Scotland Yard, in response to warrant by Spanish magistrate investigating human rights violations during era of military rule in 1960's and 1970; photo (M)", "word_count": 729, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Chileans React Moderately to Arrest", "print_headline": "Most Chileans React Moderately to Arrest", "body_text": " **********Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish to forget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the immediate popular response here to the sensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable for its moderation. **********About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at the residence of the British Ambassador on Saturday evening to protest the arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs. **********Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearby residence of the Spanish Ambassador before the police arrived in a truck with water cannon, at which point the protesters obediently withdrew. **********Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape of a leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with the protesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carried kicking and screaming into a police van. **********But in a display of uncensored political debate that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's rule, television broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrest from political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders to rightist retired colonels. **********Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of General Pinochet's dictatorial ways, including the deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people in the 17 years that followed his violent overthrow of the elected Socialist Government of President Salvador Allende in 1973. **********But most political analysts say a large majority wants to put the era of radical politics and repression behind it, a trend equally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which also went through periods of rule by military juntas. **********President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle, in Portugal for a summit meeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders, charged that Britain was breaking international law, saying that General Pinochet, now an unelected ''Senator for Life,'' carried a diplomatic passport giving him legal immunity. **********Mr. Frei leads a governing coalition that includes Christian Democrats and Socialists, and his strong defense of the general's rights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilian politicians who have spent most of their political careers opposing General Pinochet. **********Only one candidate in next year's presidential election expressed support for the Spanish and British actions, Gladys Marin of the Communist Party. ''I couldn't be more happy,'' she told local television. ''This Government has been unwilling to bring this genocidal criminal to justice over the last eight years, so it is up to the Spanish to do it.'' **********The leading leftist candidate, Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist Party, was far more cautious. Mr. Lagos gently scolded General Pinochet for not having anticipated his arrest abroad, but the candidate said he did want to get involved in a judicial matter. The two leading conservative candidates predictably criticized the arrest, and some rightist politicians urged the Government to break relations with London in protest. **********Supporters of General Pinochet pledged to mobilize street demonstrations demanding his release, while the Communist Party and human rights groups promised marches supporting the British action and a possible Spanish prosecution on charges of crimes against humanity. **********But today was just another Sunday for most Chileans, who packed Santiago's parks on a splendidly sunny spring day. A few anti-Pinochet activists left white carnations at the British Embassy as a token of thanks, while about 500 pro-Pinochet protesters peacefully returned tonight to the Spanish and English diplomatic residences. They were blocked by the police from getting too close, so they honked car horns and waved Chilean flags. **********The police reported arresting six protesters in scattered incidents around the buildings during the day. **********Trying to explain the calm, Mireya Garcia, secretary general of the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared, said: ''After 25 years of absolute impunity for violators of human rights, it takes a while for the people to absorb this news and understand its importance and dimensions.'' **********For all the normality, the arrest of General Pinochet opened a revealing window into a new Chilean society, one run by democratically elected civilians side by side with a still-influential military. President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who for years was portrayed as the Devil incarnate in the Chilean media, was shown on television in a very human light, reacting to the arrest with confused amusement. **********News clips of Chilean exiles celebrating the arrest received prominent play. The same program included an interview with Augusto Pinochet Hiriart, General Pinochet's son.

Urowsky, that the central issue of the proceeding was not the Government's position -- which has shifted somewhat in recent months as the Justice Department has learned more about the Internet Explorer browser -- but rather the judge's preliminary injunction. **********''Irrespective of what the Government has said, it is my language and my language alone which is at issue here,'' the judge said in one of his interruptions of Mr. Urowsky's opening statement. ''I'm not questioning your right to argue this; I'm questioning its relevance.'' **********But Mr. Urowsky and other Microsoft lawyers and officials reasserted the company's main defense: that Judge Jackson's broadly worded order, if followed literally, would force the company to take steps that would break Windows 95 by requiring the removal of hundreds of computer files of code that are shared by both the operating system and the browser. **********Judge Jackson issued his order after the Government contended that Microsoft was improperly leveraging its monopoly of operating systems to try to dominate browser software, the programs that are used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web. **********The company responded to the order by giving computer makers three options: an outdated version of Windows 95, a broken version of Windows 95, or the previous arrangement of Windows 95 with Internet Explorer. **********That prompted the Justice Department to say that the company had flouted the judge's order by giving computer makers a false set of choices in an attempt to insure that the Internet Explorer icon remained on the Windows desktops that are shipped with new personal computers. **********The Government maintains, and Judge Jackson demonstrated at an earlier hearing, that Microsoft, using a Windows 95 feature for installing and removing software, could comply with the order simply by deleting Internet Explorer and a handful of other files without damaging Windows 95. **********''Rather than take a reasonable approach, Microsoft took an extreme and illogical course,'' said Philip R. Malone, the antitrust division's lead trial lawyer in the case. ''Even though Microsoft had a simple, easy remedy of its own making, it opted for this extreme measure.'' **********The company contends, however, that the judge's order required it to delete hundreds of computer files that are shared by the Windows 95 operating system and the Internet Explorer. **********''Removing the icon would not have complied with the order as written,'' Mr. Urowsky said. He also asserted that Judge Jackson did not have the authority to modify his order because the issue is now in the hands of a Federal appeals court. **********Throughout the hearing, Judge Jackson appeared to be skeptical of Microsoft's assertions that it had fully complied with the order. He pointedly asked Mr. Urowsky why the company's lawyers had not come back to the court for clarification if there was any ambiguity about the order. **********Mr. Urowsky replied that Microsoft had warned the judge that the Government's requested relief would be impossible to carry out because the browser and the operating system were too intertwined. Rather than seek clarification, he said, the company had decided to appeal the order. **********The hearing is the first real trench warfare between the Government and the world's most powerful personal computer software company over marketing practices on the ever-expanding Internet. **********Microsoft's competitors, especially the Netscape Communications Corporation, which makes the market-leading Navigator browser, have devoted considerable resources to providing information to the Justice Department for use in its antitrust case, and lawyers representing Netscape and other competitors of Microsoft observed the hearing today. **********But Government and industry lawyers say that Judge Jackson's hearings, while significant, will not be the last word. In fact, the hearings are little more than an exercise in creating a more extensive record for an appeals court hearing. The appeals court has expedited the matter and is expected to hear the case as early as March. **********Most of today's four-hour hearing centered on the technical components of Internet Explorer and its relationship to Windows 95. Microsoft contends that the two are inseparable. **********But Glenn E. Weadock, the Government's expert witness, testified that the issue of integration was a false one and that the company had made available an add-remove feature that would eliminate the Internet Explorer icon and a few other components of the browser without disabling Windows 95. **********Mr. Weadock, a computer consultant from Colorado who has written and lectured extensively on Windows 95, repeated the experiment done by Judge Jackson on his own initiative last month that showed how, with a few clicks of a mouse, a user could eliminate the Internet Explorer icon and disable the main avenues for using the browser without harming the operating system. **********Later in the day, Microsoft's main expert and one of the company's leading executives for both the browser and Windows 95 basically agreed with Mr. Weadock about the use of the add-remove feature. **********''It will essentially remove the obvious ways a user can gain access to the Web browser system,'' said the expert, David Cole, a Microsoft vice president.

The surgeons are Sofamor Danek's main customers. **********Sofamor Danek has about 40 percent of a $1-billion-a-year surgical device market, which is growing 22 percent to 25 percent a year, said E. Ronald Pickard, chairman and chief executive of Sofamor. By contrast, sales of cardiovascular devices are growing in ''the high single digits,'' said William W. George, chairman and chief executive of Medtronic. **********Johnson & Johnson will have about 20 percent of the spinal implant market when it completes its recently announced acquisition of DePuy Inc., said Rick Wise, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Sofamor projects sales of $400 million this year, mainly in hardware like rods and screws, which hold together damaged vertebrae, and an imaging device for brain surgery. About 15 percent, or $400 million, of Medtronic's $2.6 billion sales are in related businesses, including pain management devices and electronic stimulators to treat tremors. **********''Sofamor Danek has a tremendous position in a field that will complement what we were doing,'' Mr. George said. ''They have lots of the same customers who we've worked with for years.'' **********Several analysts hailed the deal, which valued Sofamor Danek at $115 a share, or 13 percent above its closing price on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday, Sofamor Danek shares rose $8.50, to $110.125. Medtronic shares rose $1.5625, to $66.5625, on the Big Board. **********Under the deal, the price per share for Sofamor will be adjusted if Medtronic shares trade below $56.97 or above $69.63 in the 15 days before Sofamor Danek shareholders meet to vote on the acquisition. **********Kurt Kruger, an analyst in San Francisco at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, said Sofamor Danek could add $40 million in sales next year if it receives Federal regulatory approval for a new spinal implant device to relieve back pain. Analysts are predicting approval early in 1999 for the device, which is called a spinal cage. **********Last year, an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration sent Sofamor back to the drawing board to improve the cage, which Mr. Kruger described as an ultra-strong metal column an inch long and the diameter of a cigar. Similar devices are already being sold by the Spinetech unit that was recently acquired by Sulzer Medica, a unit of Sulzer Ltd. of Switzerland, and the Acromed unit that Johnson & Johnson is buying as part of DePuy Inc. **********As part of a reshuffling trend in heart devices, the Guidant Corporation recently agreed to buy a heart rhythm device business from Sulzer Medica. **********''Medtronic and Sofamor Danek are an excellent fit,'' Mr. Wise of Bear, Stearns said. ''No other competitor has the unique portfolio of electronic stimulation, surgical and spinal devices that the combined companies will have.'' **********Franz Tudor, an analyst at Oracle Partners, a health care investment group, said the deal made sense. But he said the opportunities for cost savings were limited because of little overlap between the two companies in manufacturing, sales and administration and research. **********A state court in Houston recently awarded $400,000 to plaintiffs who claimed injuries from a screw made by Sofamor. Mr. Pickard said the device was used in a way not recommended on the F.D.A.-approved label. He said Sofamor had disposed of more than 1,100 such lawsuits, winning 50 summary judgments and paying less than $2,000 each in some 40 cases. The company intends to defend 2,000 remaining cases vigorously, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/08/business/business-digest-746010.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 357, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Murdoch's BSkyB May Bid For British Soccer Team **********B Sky B, Rupert Murdoch's British satellite broadcasting unit, confirmed that it was in discussions to acquire the Manchester United soccer team for a reported $950 million.

Boeing executives said it could take months for the investigation to yield definitive conclusions. **********The launching was to begin the maiden voyage for the Delta 3, the latest member of a family of rockets that have been in use since the 1960's. It is unclear whether the Delta 3's novelty will compound the difficulty  of finding the cause of the accident. But it is clear that the accident comes at a particularly unfortunate moment for Boeing and for the United States aerospace business. **********That is because United States companies are still adapting to a commercial space market that was changed radically by the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986, the downsizing of the American military after the cold war and the burgeoning demand for satellite-based electronic entertainment and communications services around the world. **********''The Americans are just beginning to come back now,'' said Frederick A. Landman, chief executive of Panamsat, one of the world's leading private satellite operators, referring to the United States launching business. ''They will eventually get there.'' **********''There'' is in a position to seriously challenge Arianespace, the European space agency, for leadership in commercial satellite launching. **********The commercial satellite business has three main types of companies: builders, launchers and operators. Hughes, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, is the world's biggest builder of geostationary commercial satellites -- the type of spacecraft that orbit above a fixed point on the earth's surface and are the primary form of communications satellite in use today. **********Hughes's biggest domestic competitor is Space Systems/Loral, while Europe's largest makers of commercial satellites include Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi. Among other American builders, TRW and Lockheed Martin are best known for military satellites, although Lockheed Martin in particular is making a push into the commercial market. **********While United States companies dominate the making of commercial satellites, with as much as 70 percent of the market, they have not fared as well in the market for putting satellites into orbit. **********United States commercial launching sales grew from $295 million in 1993 to $940 million in 1997, according to the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group in Washington. But that is less than half of the  worldwide market of $2.6 billion, where Arianespace is the biggest  force. In fact, Panamsat, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., and is controlled by Hughes, plans to use Arianespace for a launching in  French Guiana next month. **********Lockheed Martin is also one of the two main United States satellite  launching companies, along with Boeing. The Delta 3 was intended to compete against Lockheed Martin's Atlas rocket in carrying bigger commercial payloads into geostationary orbit. **********The United States launchers must also compete against commercial launching companies in China, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, though many of the main Russian launching  operations have formed joint ventures with American companies. **********At the end of the commercial satellite food chain are private companies  that actually operate satellites and sell and use their services, such as Panamsat, and government satellite agencies like Intelsat. **********According to Mr. Landman of Panamsat, who spends much of his time shopping and negotiating for deals with satellite builders and launchers, the relative weakness of American companies in launching commercial satellites has its roots in the early 1980's, when NASA's space shuttle was touted as the new way to get commercial payloads off the earth. **********As the space shuttle proved itself, American launching companies focused almost exclusively on the military market. But after the Challenger explosion, the Reagan Administration severely cut back on the shuttle's use for commercial purposes, arguing that it was not worth  risking lives for tasks that could be performed by expendable rockets. The American companies, as a result, were not as prepared as European companies, 36 of which had founded Arianespace in 1980 with the idea of primarily serving the commercial market. **********Changing focus from military to commercial applications, of course, has become imperative for American aerospace companies of all sorts. Last year, for the first time, the commercial space business in the United States was larger than the market for military aircraft -- $30.6  billion versus $30.5 billion -- according to the trade group. **********The new sense of competitive urgency extends to satellite operators as well as satellite makers. Some companies test a new rocket with a dummy payload to make sure that it works correctly. But Boeing opted to use a live payload, the Galaxy X satellite made by Hughes, in the launching of the Delta 3 last week.  And Panamsat was ready to be the extraterrestrial guinea pig, because it wants to encourage the development of new rockets. **********Last week's entire $225 million mission was insured. Last fall, Panamsat opened a policy worth more than $3 billion with an insurance group led by Space Machine Advisors, based in Greenwich, Conn. Referring to a Space Machine Advisors executive who was at the attempted launching last week, a Panamsat spokesman said, ''He was the one with the real pale look on his face.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/25/business/company-briefs-587010.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********HOST MARRIOTT CORP., Bethesda, Md., the lodging and real estate company, acquired the 487-room Torrance Marriott Hotel in Los Angeles for $52 million. **********WINDMERE-DURABLE HOLDINGS INC., Miami Lakes, Fla., said it would take a second-quarter charge of $11 million, or 54 cents a share, as it stops making some personal-care products to increase production of higher-margin household appliances under the Black & Decker name. **********GUILFORD MILLS INC., Greensboro, N.C., said it would buy back up to 2.5 million shares, or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock. **********TYCO SUBMARINE SYSTEMS CO., Exeter, N.H., a unit of Tyco International Ltd., signed an agreement with Global Photon Systems Inc. to build the first part of a Pacific Coast fiber optic undersea cable system connecting Canada and Mexico.

Long convoys, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, are leaving bases where the Government had promised that their forces would remain and are putting men in new positions or taking territory from the rebels. **********The rebels, who moved into many areas vacated by the Serbs in October, are stepping up the recruiting and training of fighters and are obtaining large amounts of military gear, according to diplomats. In the last week eight Serbs have been slain. Serbs are convinced that the rebels are responsible, and many are threatening to take their revenge against ethnic Albanian civilians. **********The Supreme Commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley C. Clark, and senior American diplomats went to Belgrade today to tell top Yugoslav officials to rein in their forces. **********But many Western diplomats in Yugoslavia say they doubt that they can stop renewed combat on a large scale, even though it had been believed that the harsh Balkan winter would prevent any new conflict. The chief Western diplomat in Kosovo, William Walker, an American, is more optimistic than others. Still, he said there was not much the West could do except try to persuade the rebels and the Government to act peacefully. **********''I hope no one is overestimating the tools at our disposal,'' Mr. Walker said. ''We don't have many.'' **********In a month or so, as many as 2,000 international observers are scheduled to be on the ground in Kosovo, monitoring each side and trying to ease tensions. Now, however, there is a question whether war will erupt before most monitors are in place. **********A senior Western diplomat, referring to the rebel-run Kosovo Liberation Army, said: ''The Government's decided enough is enough; the K.L.A. is out of control. If the Government responds the way it seems to be getting ready to do, then the monitors will have to get out because there'll be war everywhere.'' **********Today in this village, six tanks were involved in combat with rebel forces that recently moved into the area. The tanks left their base over the weekend for what the Government called a training exercise. New rebel trenches have been set up on the hills around the fighting. **********The fighting here, along with the appearance today of heavily armed Serbian paramilitary policemen on the roads nearby, comes after a police official was shot to death as he walked to work this morning in a neighboring town. **********None of this was supposed to happen after President Slobodan Milosevic, under threat of NATO air strikes, agreed to stop offensive operations and withdraw many of his forces from Kosovo in October. Diplomats, led by Americans, thought that if the Government halted their  attacks, the rebels would honor a cease-fire, allowing negotiations. **********But negotiations have made little progress. Most ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population, want independence. The Government is offering limited autonomy, and ethnic Albanian political leaders are deeply divided over what level of autonomy would be acceptable. Rebel leaders generally feel that they can win independence through war. **********On Saturday, when the body of the Deputy Mayor of Kosovo Polje, a Serb, was found by the roadside shot to death, Miroslav Mijailovic, one of the 1,000 or so residents of the village of Velika Hoca, was welcoming guests to his home. The Serbian family was giving its annual homage to its patron, St. Nicholas. **********Dishes of potatoes, sweet peppers, cabbage rolls, fish and cookies nearly overflowed the long table as people tried to find solace in talk of religion and tradition. But it did not work, because they said they could feel Kosovo sliding quickly into war. **********''The people are not to blame for what is coming, not the Serb people or the Albanian,'' Mr. Mijailovic said. ''Everyone wants what we had before, peace. But there are leaders on both sides who are setting a fire.'' **********Historically, Serbs and ethnic Albanians have been very close in the area of western Kosovo near Velika Hoca. But now, the guests said, they are terrified by rebel fighters they see on the hills around the village. **********The two peoples were so close that one guest, the Serbian Mayor of the city of Orahovac, three miles away, said one of his best friends was the man who is now the rebel commander for the area. **********''When he started his chicken farm, he came to me for the money to buy the first load of chicken feed,'' said the Mayor, Andjelko Kolasinac. **********''We are at the limits of our patience,'' Mr. Kolasinac said. ''The West must put enough pressure on the K.L.A. that they stop what they are doing. Otherwise what I see coming will not be stopped.'' **********When the Government has taken action against the rebels in the past, it has usually been so brutal that it has only increased the conviction among ethnic Albanians that they must create their own country. **********A large military offensive over the summer forced as many as 300,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. Government forces then looted and burned an estimated 20,000 houses. It was the prospect of mass starvation and deaths caused by exposure in the Balkan winter that prompted Western countries to intercede so that refugees could feel safe enough to move back to their villages. **********But even now, in response to the rebel actions, Government forces often brutalize ethnic Albanians. **********After the funerals last Wednesday of six young Serbs shot in a coffee shop in the city of Pec, the police went on a rampage for several days, arresting and severely beating dozens of ethnic Albanian men. **********Many victims said they had not even been questioned about the killings, only beaten. **********At the same time, Government forces retook a nearby village, causing hundreds of ethnic Albanian civilians to flee the area. **********As his children packed clothes, blankets and bags of flour and a red kerosene lantern into a wagon behind the family tractor in the village, called Glodanje, Nysret Maloku echoed the appeal Serbs are making to Western countries. ''You must stop these attacks on us,'' he said. ''We want peace, but we want to survive.'' **********And just as Serbs are insisting that Government forces be unleashed against the rebels, Mr. Maloku said he wanted the Kosovo Liberation Army to strike back at the Government. **********''They have to protect us from the regime,'' he said.

But the level of skittishness about taking Iraq at its word this time was manifest in the delay in beginning today's Security Council session. The postponement arose from fears that an Iraqi official was already rolling back the added clarifications that allowed President Clinton to give Iraq a chance to prove itself and avoid a military attack. **********The last-minute hitch arose when Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister and spokesman on the arms issue, said in a CNN interview from Baghdad that Iraq was committed only to what he had written to Mr. Annan on Saturday. ''Nothing beyond that,'' he added for emphasis. **********That letter was rejected as inadequate by the Clinton Administration, which refused to join a Security Council consensus this weekend until two further, brief letters were received from Mr. Hamdoon. Those letters removed some ambiguities in Iraq's pledges. Was Mr. Aziz now disavowing them? **********Peter Burleigh, the American representative and this month's Council president, asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to straighten this out with Mr. Aziz, who told the Secretary General on the telephone late this afternoon that he regarded Mr. Hamdoon's letters as part of his own. **********Against this backdrop, it was not surprising that the Council prefaced the most critical paragraph in its statement with, ''Taking note of past experience with Iraq . . .'' **********''We remain vigilant and alert,'' said the British envoy, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, after the meeting. The Council demanded that the Iraqis show their intentions with ''unconditional and sustained cooperation.'' **********Those intentions will be tested as early as Tuesday, when more than 100 arms inspectors are expected to return to Baghdad, said Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom. **********His inspectors, who monitor biological, chemical and missile systems, and those of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who watch Iraq's nuclear activities, have been in Bahrain since Wednesday, when they were withdrawn in the face of a possible American military strike. **********About 150 relief workers will also be returning to Iraq from Amman, Jordan, most as early as tomorrow, said Benon Sevan, the director of the Iraq humanitarian program. **********Iraq has long sought a review of sanctions on its terms, with the lifting of sanctions foreordained. By referring to Iraq's talking points for such a review, contained in an annex to the letter to Mr. Annan Saturday, Mr. Lavrov raised a matter that is a virtual anathema to Washington. **********Mr. Lavrov also returned to the dormant theme of the behavior of Unscom inspectors, a theme Iraq plays on when explaining why it will not tolerate spot inspections at certain sites. **********''Unscom also has to be guided by general principles, including the respect for sovereignty of Iraq and respect for dignity of Iraq and, of course, its territorial integrity,'' Mr. Lavrov said. ''I believe that those are very clear provisions, and there were instances in the past that some Unscom members were not entirely within those parameters.'' **********With the Clinton Administration no longer blocking agreement on how to respond to Saddam Hussein's overture on Saturday, the Security Council met today only to acknowledge formally Iraq's decision to resume cooperation. **********Despite predictions among diplomats that some Council members would take the opportunity to criticize President Clinton, albeit diplomatically, for his comments about helping dissidents overthrow President Hussein, which many did not consider conducive to fostering cooperation from Baghdad, the Administration was applauded. **********Most Council members and United Nations officials did not support the use of force to end this crisis. Their sense of relief was summed up by Mr. Annan after the meeting. **********''In common with many members of the Security Council, I am grateful to President Clinton for the courageous and the difficult decision he took earlier today,'' Mr. Annan said.

They listened to their pragmatic party leader, Gianfranco Fini, 46 -- who is being called the ''Tony Blair of the Italian right'' -- declare that the party has completed its break with the past and is ready to embrace a future untinged by old ideological battles. **********''The National Alliance has no intention of using the history and the tragedies of the century that is now ending as political weapons,'' he said. **********Oddly enough, it was not Mr. Fini, but his centrist ally, Silvio Berlusconi, the magnate and former Prime Minister, who addressed the conference like a ghostly voice from another era. **********He warned darkly about Communist tendencies among Italy's governing leftists and distributed 5,000 free copies of the Italian edition (printed by a publishing house that he owns) of a much-discussed French book that presents an exhaustive account of crimes committed under Communism. **********To some political commentators, Mr. Berlusconi's diatribe, aimed mostly at the Milan-based prosecutors who have targeted him and his businesses in their ongoing corruption investigation, was another sign that he had lost his political touch. **********It has been more than three years since Mr. Berlusconi's Government was unseated by the defection of a coalition ally, and almost two years since the victory of Italy's governing center-left coalition put him, with Mr. Fini, into the opposition. **********Despite the partial reforms enacted after the great corruption scandals of the early 1990's, a 22-month-old Government is something of a novelty for Italy. For several months, commentators have been marveling at the rare period of political stability, though critics of Prime Minister Romano Prodi's Government have begun to complain that it has already behaving like a ''regime.'' **********Now on the verge of winning its hard-fought battle to bring Italy into Europe's new common currency, the Prodi Government shows no signs that it is ready to topple. Faced with a lull, Italy's political forces have taken the occasion to take stock, and where possible, to regroup. **********Two weeks ago, Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left -- the moderate heir to the old Communist party, and the mainstay of the governing coalition -- told participants at a conference in Florence of his hopes to unite with other progressive parties in a new party that would drop, once and for all, the old Communist symbols. The hammer-and-sickle, although much diminished, still has its niche on the party symbol. **********For the Italian right, the most unsettling development recently has been the effort by former President Francesco Cossiga to put together a new party at the center of the political spectrum. That is where he and many other former Christian Democrats, nostalgic for the once-governing party that collapsed under the weight of the corruption scandals, still feel most comfortable. **********Already, some members of the center-right alliance -- still led by Mr. Berlusconi -- have defected to Mr. Cossiga. But for many political analysts, the most puzzling question on the Italian right is the fate of  Forza Italia, the political movement  Mr. Berlusconi put together, virtually single-handedly and almost overnight, in 1994 to propel the center-right coalition to victory. **********Back then, Mr. Berlusconi -- a self-made man with a television personality's unstoppable smile -- presented himself as the image of success. Now, faced with a calendar of back-to-back court cases, including appeals on one conviction, and a coalition that suffered new defeats in local elections in December, Mr. Berlusconi has an altogether different image. **********''Aside from the effects of Cossiga's party, Berlusconi should remove himself from the political scene,'' said Marcello Venenziani, a right-wing political commentator. ''His strength was tied to his image as a winner, but for the last three years, he has been losing.'' **********If Forza Italia were to collapse abruptly, its voters would probably split between the right and the center -- between Mr. Fini's National Alliance and Mr. Cossiga's new party, Mr. Venenziani predicted. **********Mr. Fini, who spoke twice to repeated applause at the Verona conference, presented several new themes for his party, continuing an odyssey begun three years ago when he dropped the party's post-Fascist symbols and some of its die-hard supporters. In the last national elections, the National Alliance won almost 16 percent of the vote, not much of a gain on its 1994 performance. **********Now, Mr. Fini seems bent on luring new supporters from Italy's northern regions, where the secessionist Northern League has played successfully to widespread dissatisfaction with the inefficiencies, corruption and heavy-handedness of the Government in Rome. **********Breaking wth his party's old statist, centralist views that traditionally have had strong appeal in Italy's poorer southern regions, Mr. Fini spoke sympathetically this weekend of northern Italy's complaints, and advocated a federalist solution. **********''We are at a crossroad now,'' said Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of the Italian Fascist dictator and a frequent critic of the party leadership. ''We will either be crushed as a small party of the right, or we will become a political party capable of setting the rules for what's left of the center-right coalition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/business/diary-236110.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIARY", "print_headline": "DIARY", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY **********Corporate Profits Falter **********Corporate profits fell 2.3 percent in the last quarter of 1997, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $483.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported, while the gross domestic product rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate -- less than the 3.9 percent reported earlier -- because consumer spending for services was less robust than first calculated. But numbers for February were far stronger. Sales of existing single-family homes rose 8.7 percent to a record annual rate of 4.75 million, and, excluding aircraft, orders for durable goods were up half a percentage point; over all, orders for big-ticket items fell 1.7 percent in February. **********MARKETS **********Stocks Stumble; Rates Rise **********The stock market, recently red-hot, chilled out, just as some in the media were gearing up to report on a 9,000 Dow. By late in the week, that milestone looked elusive, as the average ended at 8,796.08, down 110.35 from last week. One reason was earnings disappointments. Another was an upturn in the price of oil, which depressed airline and other transportion stocks. A third was a rise in interest rates and fear that the Fed would eventually push up rates to avert inflation. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended the week at 5.96 percent, up eight basis points. **********WALL STREET **********Heady Days for Big Firms **********Enjoying some of the most favorable financial market conditions in years, Goldman, Sachs & Company, the last big investment banking partnership on Wall Street, reported a 13 percent gain in quarterly pretax earnings to a record $1.02 billion. Lehman Brothers Holdings reported an unexpectedly strong 30 percent rise in net income to $187 million, led by fees from advising on corporate mergers and other investment banking services. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company reported a 21 percent gain in net income to $691 million, or $1.10 a fully diluted share, 4 cents above analysts' estimates. But earnings on its Discover credit card business were down 21 percent, to $99 million. **********PEOPLE **********A New Chief at Intel **********Andrew S. Grove, 61, left, will pass the chief executive's mantle at Intel to a well-groomed successor, Craig R. Barrett, the 58-year-old president, but will continue working full-time as chairman. Intel's microprocessors are the ''brain'' in more than 80 percent of the world's personal computers. . . . Roger A. Enrico, Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, is giving up his salary -- $900,000 last year -- to pay for scholarships for employees' children. . . . Time Warner granted its chairman, Gerald M. Levin, stock options that would allow him to collect $25.2 million in 2003. . . . Kim B. Edwards resigned as president and chief executive of Iomega, maker of the Zip disk drive, less than two weeks after the company warned that it expected a loss. **********DEALS **********U.S. Sues Lockheed **********The Justice Department sued to block Lockheed Martin's purchase of Northrop Grumman, contending that merging the two military contractors could hurt innovation and undermine national security.

Connecticut legislators defeated a bill that would have helped Echlin Inc., an auto parts maker based in the state, repel a hostile $3 billion bid from a smaller rival, the SPX Corporation. **********PUBLISHING **********Achtung! Lesen Sie Gut* **********The largest English-language publisher of trade books would be neither English nor American, but German, if a blockbuster deal is completed. Bertelsmann A.G. agreed to buy Random House for an estimated $1.4 billion. Combining Random House with its Bantam Doubleday Dell division, Bertelsmann would have some 10 percent of the $21 billion American book market. The Newhouse family, which has owned Random House since 1980, appeared to be getting its businesses in order for the next generation. Some authors and agents were dismayed, fearing there would be less competition for books and less demand for literary works that lack best-seller potential, but Peter W. Olson, standing, chairman of Bertelsmann's North American book group, and Thomas Middelhoff, seated, the company's chief executive, were all smiles. ***********Attention! Read Well **********BANKING **********A Blow to a Banking Bill **********Investment banking and commercial banking have been separated in the United States since 1933, when the Glass-Steagall Act was passed as part of Depression-era measures aimed at eliminating abuses thought to be responsible for the nation's financial collapse. And if the powerful American Bankers Association has its way, they will stay separated. Although its member banks differ on the bill, the group announced its official opposition to the Republican-sponsored Financial Services Act of 1998, which would allow securities firms, insurance companies and commercial banks to merge and would expand the Federal Reserve's regulatory authority. The bill will go to the House floor for a vote on Tuesday. **********TAXES **********Overhauling the I.R.S. **********The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, unveiled his long-awaited bill to rein in the I.R.S. and grant oversight authority to an independent board. His proposal goes further than a version passed by the House last year to prevent what critics say is widespread abuse of taxpayers by overzealous I.R.S. agents. Although the goal of overhauling the I.R.S. has wide support in Congress and the Administration, the bill faces a number of obstacles. For example, Senator Roth sees foregone revenue of $9.5 billion over 5 years and more than $20 billion over 10 years. **********SPORTS **********Investors Cry Foul **********H. Wayne Huizenga, left, who owns three of South Florida's four professional sports teams -- the football Miami Dolphins, the baseball Florida Marlins and the hockey Florida Panthers -- insists that his baseball and hockey franchises are losing money. Still, he has found ways to profit. There is a cable television station, and he owns Pro Player Stadium, where the Marlins and the Dolphins play. And, in an original turn, he took the Panthers public and used the team's stock as currency to begin building another diversified enterprise. As a result, his original investment in Florida Panthers Holdings has nearly tripled in value, to $150 million. But investors -- unless they got in early -- have not done nearly so well, and shareholders have filed three class-action lawsuits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/business/too-many-cooks-not-nearly-enough.html": {"writer_name": "Amanda Hesser", "pub_date": "1998-10-25", "snippet": "Article on chef industry in New York City, which continues to boom; Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts food preparation and service will be fastest-growing occupations through 2006; most restaurant jobs, other than executive and 'star' chefs, pay...", "word_count": 2348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Too Many Cooks?

Not Nearly Enough", "body_text": " **********ON a recent Sunday night at Le Cirque 2000, dinners were flying out of the kitchen like baseballs from a batting machine. In a matter of four hours, over 300 diners would be decadently fed, plied with wine, and sent home filled with black truffles and chocolate. **********Mike Camelo, a 26-year-old cook whose arms are striped with burn scars, was working the meat station. When an order of beef tenderloin was ready to go, the saute cook handed it to him on top of a cloth napkin. Mr. Camelo sprinkled it with chopped parsley and coarse salt and placed it on a heated plate, atop a mound of glistening vegetables. He ladled on the sauce, made earlier in the day by the saucier, and then walked the finished dish over to Sottha Khunn, the executive chef, who looked it over, covered it with a silver dome and, with a flick of his wrist, signaled for the plate to be delivered to an expectant diner. **********Mr. Camelo did this all night long. He plated food and poured sauce. Food. Sauce. Food. Sauce. And not just this particular evening. This is his routine six nights a week. His pay is $12.55 an hour. And his is a highly sought-after job in the cooking world -- a field gaining a reputation as one filled with opportunity, fame and fortune. **********Opportunity certainly abounds. With the strong economy and the steady increase in two-worker households, more people are eating out. And as more restaurants open, the demand for restaurant workers just keeps growing. According to projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food preparation and service will be the fastest-growing occupations through 2006. Among chefs, cooks and kitchen workers alone, the Government expects an average of 1.27 million jobs to be created each year. **********But for all the job openings, there can be only one executive chef in every restaurant. And there are even fewer star chefs, the ones who clone their prestigious restaurants and turn themselves into hot ''brands.'' Even in New York, where there are more restaurants than in any other city in the United States, only five have won four-star ratings from The New York Times. **********In a simpler time, succeeding as a chef was primarily about talent and the ability to endure the long hours and physical demands. Today, though, rising to the top of the profession -- becoming the next Sottha Khunn or Jean Georges Vongerichten, of Manhattan's Jean Georges, JoJo and Vong -- involves much more. It takes careful planning and networking, years of sharp-elbowed ladder-climbing in the kitchen and, usually, a large financial investment on which the return will probably be slow. **********First, of course, you must learn to cook. This year, there were 740 cooking school programs in the United States, compared with 360 in 1989. That count includes vacation classes for cooking enthusiasts, vocational school and community college programs, and academies like the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. The largest schools that offer cooking programs -- like the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.; the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt., and Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I. -- are full-blown colleges with two- and four-year programs. **********The benefits of top-drawer training are clear. ''If you're lucky enough to go to a school like the C.I.A. or the F.C.I., that almost assures you some kind of higher entry-level position,'' said Michael Batterberry, the founder of Food Arts magazine, a trade publication. **********BUT that assurance doesn't come cheap. Tuition and meals for the two-year degree program at the Culinary Institute of America, for instance, run $15,400 a year; students who stay on for a four-year bachelor of professional studies degree pay $10,800 for each of the last two years. After four years, graduates can leave with loans totaling more than $52,000, according to Andrea Harding, director of public relations at the school. **********Yet while the graduates of top cooking schools have far more hands-on experience in their field than a Harvard M.B.A. does in, say, closing an investment banking deal, the payoff on a degree hardly compares. **********Gina Santiago, a recent graduate of the New England Culinary Institute, has about $20,000 in loans to repay but makes just $12.55 an hour as a garde-manger (or cold-appetizer station) cook at Le Cirque 2000. **********''For the experience I'm getting in a restaurant of this caliber, it's fine,'' said Ms. Santiago, 22, who returned to her native Puerto Rico after graduation but came to New York for the chance to work at the restaurant. ''You're here so many hours, it all equals out. We get our meals here.'' **********Le Cirque 2000 is hardly the most tight-fisted kitchen in fine dining. It is unionized, and its pay scales are higher than those in most independent restaurants. Prep cooks, who cut vegetables, strain stocks and perform minor cooking tasks, make  $11.57 an hour; line cooks, who prepare dishes for table service, make at least $12.55. **********One of those line cooks, Bridget Eagan, who works the pasta station, takes home $496 a week for six long days of work. Ms. Eagan, who is 21, considers that an acceptable salary for her first job out of school. But her roommate -- who is several years older and much more experienced -- earns less, as a line cook at Cafe Boulud, an expensive new bistro owned by one of New York's star chefs, Daniel Boulud. (Asked about the salaries at Cafe Boulud, Alex Lee, the sous chef, said, ''I try to tell people who come here that they're investing in their future.'') **********These days, the first few years out of cooking school can be seen as a form of graduate school. In New York, the way you earn your advanced degree determines your future. Those aspiring to be four-star chefs try to get jobs in four-star restaurants like Le Cirque 2000. They put in at a least a year, but almost never more than two, covering as many stations in the kitchen as possible before moving on to study with other master chefs. **********Mr. Camelo, a graduate of Johnson & Wales, has worked every station at Le Cirque 2000 during the last year and a half, from the garde-manger to the pasta and risotto station to the grill. He is now what is called a tournant, which means he floats around the kitchen, from noon to midnight, working wherever he is needed. **********Cooks are competitive about stations, which in a kitchen this large -- there are over 40 cooks -- are clearly defined. Garde-manger is low on the ladder; a bit higher are the cooking stations for hot appetizers and pasta and risotto. Highly coveted are the positions at the fish, meat and grill lines, where the main courses are prepared. **********The cooks keep track of who is coming, who is going and where they can make their next moves. Even Pedro Cabrera, 42, a prep cook who has not gone to cooking school and does not speak English, is positioning himself for promotion. He comes in early every day to study with the fish butcher, so that he can take over that position should the current butcher leave. **********What is most important for these cooks, though, is to maintain a good rapport with Mr. Khunn. That way, when their time in his kitchen is up, he will help them get jobs at other top restaurants. A cook needs to move around, Mr. Khunn explained in his thick Cambodian accent:  ''Like a designer, he needs to see the Calvin Klein, the Prada, before he decides what style he wants.'' **********New York's restaurant world, as enormous as it may seem, is actually quite cozy, chefs say. ''Chefs get together, and they talk to each other,'' said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, founder of the French Culinary Institute. ''They know when a cook is on the line and he's ready for the next step.'' Cooks who stay in the city come into contact with one another again and again. Networking is vital, and missteps can be costly. If, for instance, a cook leaves a job before completing the time the chef expected him to stay, word spreads quickly and he could lose his ticket into other kitchens. **********IN large cities across the United States, cooks spend a few years traveling circuits similar to those in New York, trying to move up the ladder as they hop from restaurant to restaurant. After five to seven years at top restaurants, a cook can easily be poised to open her own small restaurant, if she can find backers, or to be hired as a sous chef -- the second in command -- at one of the top spots, if she can sublimate her ego to the proprietor's. **********Some cooks, though, trade academic training, or the early years of domestic networking, for tours abroad. ''I don't think there's any experience that replaces going to Europe,'' Ms. Cann Hamilton said. ''It shows curiosity and stamina.'' **********For instance, Traci Des Jardins, the chef and owner of Jardiniere, a San Francisco restaurant known for its blend of French and California cuisine, bypassed cooking school to apprentice with Joachim Splichal of Seventh Street Bistro in Los Angeles. Then she worked at several of Europe's gastronomic temples, including Lucas Carton and Arpege in Paris and Louis XV in Monte Carlo. After just eight months at these Michelin three-star restaurants, she returned to the United States and was snapped up by the Manhattan restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who hired her as the sous chef at Montrachet, his three-star restaurant in Tribeca. **********As a cook gets closer to setting out on his own, he must know how to market himself. ''As with any art, there's the element of luck -- meeting the right patrons who think your cooking is terrific, and terrific enough to back it,'' Mr. Batterberry said. ''But that's a little like discovering Lana Turner at the soda fountain.'' **********IT helps to work in a place where you have visibility. Thomas Keller, the chef at the celebrated French Laundry in California's Napa Valley, for instance, established a following in Manhattan with his inventive cuisine at Rakel. Mr. Vongerichten became known when he was the chef at Lafayette, the restaurant in the Drake Swissotel, where he helped revive the reputation of hotel restaurant dining. When these men made the move to chef and owner, both investors and faithful diners followed. **********Advancement to the level of executive chef is faster these days. The emergence of the celebrity chef -- people like Wolfgang Puck and Emeril Lagasse, with multiple restaurants, television shows and book contracts -- has driven up the pace of ambition. **********So have the career changers increasingly entering the field, drawn by the prospect of fame and familiar enough with success that they are disinclined to pay their dues. ''People are leaving Wall Street; they're leaving law professions,'' Ms. Cann Hamilton said. ''They're not going to want to wait to get a decent salary.'' **********Many chefs lament this new attitude. ''The kids, they go to school and they are made to think they become chefs,'' Mr. Khunn said. ''But that is not the reality.'' **********Though pay scales have improved over the years, they remain much like those for other artistic professions. ''For every rock singer who makes a zillion dollars, there's a group that's barely able to eke it out,'' Mr. Batterberry said. It is the same, he added, for chefs. According to a study by the National Restaurant Association, salaries for people with the title of executive chef -- the kitchen C.E.O.'s -- averaged just $38,000 in 1995, and pay has not escalated much since then. **********Other than salaries, probably the most eye-opening reality for aspiring chefs is learning what an executive chef does. Much more time is spent managing staff, controlling costs and schmoozing with customers than on cooking, much less creating. **********At Le Cirque 2000, Mr. Khunn -- who generally works 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week -- spends much of his day taking inventory and ordering food so that there is enough to feed nearly 1,200 customers a day at lunches, dinners and banquets. He hires cooks, arranges schedules and, during mealtimes, darts around the kitchen, keeping an eye on the line cooks' sauces, advising the garde-manger about the thickness of the sliced prosciutto, expediting orders and putting those silver dome lids over finished dishes. But almost never does he stir, slice or saute. **********In top restaurants, much of the cooking and creating is left to the sous chef, sometimes called the chef de cuisine. ''If you want the focus of what you're doing to be cooking, then get to be a sous chef in a good kitchen,'' Ms. Des Jardins said. ''I really miss that, coming in and being at the stoves all day.'' **********But even getting to that level means years of hard physical work, long hours and mind-numbing repetition. Cooking is an art, but working proficiently in a professional kitchen is a craft. Perhaps Ms. Cann Hamilton summed it up best: ''You make this fantastic Jean Georges dish, but then you have to serve it 10,000 times.'' **********IT is no wonder that there is so much transience. Over two recent weeks at Le Cirque 2000, the entire fabric of the kitchen altered.  One of the pasta cooks quit. Cooks from Germany and France arrived to begin 18-month apprenticeships. Mr. Camelo gave notice. (''I've been feeling trapped here a little,'' he explained.) And Andrew Carmellini, the sous chef, who had helped Mr. Khunn get Le Cirque 2000 up and running, dropped a bomb by giving notice, too; he had been hired away by Cafe Boulud. **********Mr. Khunn was scrambling. In addition to making an appearance at Le Cirque 2000's new restaurant at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and continuing to train his small army of New York cooks, who at various moments during dinner service looked confused, he had to search for a new sous chef. **********For this important hire, Mr. Khunn cannot place collegial calls to other chefs. He has to headhunt, and it is likely that he will hire someone away from another restaurant, much in the same way his understudy was plucked away from him. **********Resumes, anyone?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/business/company-news-metamor-in-250-million-deal-with-corporate-services.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-06-10", "snippet": "Metamor Worldwide Inc to sell its Corestaff Services unit to Corporate Services Group PLC for $250 million (S)", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "METAMOR IN $250 MILLION DEAL WITH CORPORATE SERVICES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; METAMOR IN $250 MILLION DEAL WITH CORPORATE SERVICES", "body_text": " **********Metamor Worldwide Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Corestaff Services unit to the Corporate Services Group P.L.C. for $250 million.

This was especially true of shares in companies providing typically Japanese goods and services, like sushi restaurants, karaoke machines and jukus, the famous cram schools. **********These companies, many of which are small, family-run businesses that trade on the Japan Securities' Dealers Quotation System, have few overseas outlets and often little appeal beyond Japan's borders, so they sink or swim with the domestic economy. **********Last year they sank, but some Tokyo analysts who specialize in small-capitalization issues said the Jasdaq stocks have been so beaten down that there are now some attractive value plays. **********Tetsuya Furumoto, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. in Tokyo, spoke enthusiastically of Yonkyu Co., a wholesaler of the cultivated fish that are made into sushi and sashimi. **********Mr. Furumoto said Yonkyu had an advantage in the expanding fish-wholesale trade: It is one of the few corporations armed with modern management techniques in an industry dominated by regional cooperatives that do not have hard-driven profit motives. **********Yonkyu stands to benefit from another factor: Japan's growing dependence on farmed fish products. Japan's domestic-fisheries production has been on the wane, owing to declining fish populations and strict regulations. **********- **********FALLING CATCHES are offset partially by imports, but Japan will increasingly find it difficult to meet its domestic needs, Mr. Furumoto predicted, as the global movement to manage maritime resources curbs worldwide fish production. **********\"Yet, Japanese people like sushi,\" Mr. Furumoto said. **********Yonkyu, with its mainstay business in wholesaling cultivated fish, is riding an industry trend to focus on cultured fish, which include yellowtail, sea bream and kanpachi, a fish available only in Asian waters. **********Mr. Furumoto estimated that Yonkyu, whose 1997 operating profit is likely to reach a record 2.2 billion yen ($17.4 million), would see its profit grow 14 percent a year for the next two years. **********Another option is chains of popular sushi restaurants that have rapidly expanded their consumer base in recent years, responding to public demands for low prices and fast-food-style convenience. **********The over-the-counter-listed shops include Atom Corp., Kappa Create Co. and Genki Sushi Co. All have recorded healthy growth over the years, but intensifying competition among these and other nonlisted companies have clouded their continued growth prospects, analysts said. **********Within the take-out food arena, Plenus Co. is notable for its ability to serve a price-conscious public tasty bento box lunches. These contain hot rice, an essential ingredient, and a variety of other Japanese dishes, such as fried fish, egg rolls and pickles. **********The company operates a chain of franchised bento shops in the southern region of Kyushu and also has stores throughout the country that serve gyudon, a popular Japanese dish in which cooked beef is placed on top of warm rice. **********Analysts are often drawn to Plenus's rich cash flow, exceeding 36 billion yen, according to Salomon Brothers Asia's estimate for the year ending February 1998. This gives the company an ability to finance its growth internally, a critical asset for a cash-hungry company that wants to add stores in uncultivated areas. **********One of the most out-of-favor sectors in Jasdaq today is the industry for juku, the private schools that, while operating outside the official educational system, play a crucial role in nurturing young students' abilities. **********The combination of the poor economy and the prospect that the declining birth rate could savagely cut the estimated 1 trillion yen market has depressed virtually all the dozen or so juku stocks on the market. Bouts of selling last year have spawned a rare category of stocks for the Japanese equity market overall: high yielders. **********\"The sector has come down to a level where the valuation is attractive and the yield high,\" said Toshiaki Jimbow, chief OTC analyst at Wako Research Institute, \"and while it is uncertain if these stocks will rebound, one may assume that perceived downside risk is limited, which makes a case for a yield-based investment that comes with a little hope on the upside.\" **********Mr. Jimbow said that this strategy generally applies to stocks traded over the counter, where 63 percent of the shares trade below book price. As for dividends, he added, investors only need wait until the end of March to qualify for payouts on most stocks. **********Mr. Jimbow finds that Up Inc., a juku chain based in the Kansai region, offers a growth scenario in a sagging industry. The company, which had primarily taught elementary and junior high students, has been successfully building a program for high schoolers preparing for college-entrance examinations. **********This \"vertical\" approach makes sense in an industry that is shrinking, Mr. Jimbow said, especially as the school attempts to recapture students who had attended its classes for younger pupils. **********Up yields about 3 percent. Step Co., another juku with a profit-growth mechanism, yields a whopping 4.7 percent. **********Step, it should be noted, has shed almost 50 percent of its value since The Money Report mentioned the stock in May, but the company's current, or pretax, earnings rose 6.5 percent in the year through September, and analysts said its growth outlook was good. **********Mr. Jimbow of Wako Research Institute noted that jukus were normally not exposed to credit risks, because parents in Japan rarely default on their children's tuition bills. Nor are they entirely at the mercy of the business cycle, he said, because \"people spend money for kids' education whether the economy is good or bad.\" **********Meanwhile, although the youth population is contracting, the ranks of the elderly are swelling. **********Fontaine Co., a manufacturer of women's fashion wigs, thus finds itself in an increasingly favorable business environment. **********\"The baby-boomer generation is aging and as people grow older, they lose hair,\" said Masahisa Shirata, an analyst at Nikko Securities Investment Trust and Management Co. who follows OTC stocks. \"Such population will grow rapidly.\" **********Women in this group do not just want the wigs, they have the financial clout to afford such luxury items, Mr. Shirata added. People 60 and older hold about half of the savings in Japan, he said. \"Fontaine is in the market that attracts consumers that want the product and have the means to pay for them,\" he added. **********While some companies attempt to cash in on aging in Japan, others focus beyond that \u2014 on dying. Mr. Jimbow at Wako Research noted that Nichiryoku Co., a cemetery developer and seller of Buddhist-style tombstones called boseki, is in a growing market as the number of deaths is projected to balloon in the coming decades. \"It is rare that such a business has come on to the market,\" Mr. Jimbow said. Nichiryoku, which went public on Feb. 20, is a high yielder at 3.6 percent , and one only needs to wait until the end of this month for a dividend check."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/02/world/suharto-rebuilds-his-political-base-to-shield-fortune.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1998-07-02", "snippet": "Former Pres Suharto of Indonesia is maneuvering to rebuild political power base to shield his family's financial empire from scrutiny by future Governments and help his children keep their top posts in ruling Golkar party; he and his six children ...", "word_count": 760, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SUHARTO REBUILDS HIS POLITICAL BASE TO SHIELD FORTUNE", "print_headline": "SUHARTO REBUILDS HIS POLITICAL BASE TO SHIELD FORTUNE", "body_text": " **********Suharto, the former President of Indonesia, is maneuvering to re-establish a political power base to shield his family's financial empire from scrutiny by future Governments, according to Clinton Administration officials and Western diplomats. **********There is no direct evidence that the Suharto family has tried to bribe political or military leaders, the officials say. But they add that Mr. Suharto and his six children are offering to underwrite the political campaigns of legislators who vow loyalty to the family, which has a fortune in the billions of dollars. **********Administration officials and diplomats agree that Mr. Suharto does not appear to be seeking reinstatement as President. He resigned in May after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Indonesia's largest cities demanding his ouster. **********Instead, they say, intelligence reports reaching the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the Defense Department show that he is making use of his riches and his ties to the military to help his children retain their businesses and their top posts in the ruling political party, at a time when the political moorings of Indonesia are fraying. **********Next week the party, known as Golkar, is holding a special national congress to pick new leaders. **********Mr. Suharto remains chairman of the party's board of patrons, and two of his children have been appointed to the seven-member organizing committee for the congress. Four of his children are members of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly. **********That Mr. Suharto, 77, retains close ties to the military, the nation's most powerful institution, was in evidence in June when he accompanied several powerful army generals to Islamic prayers in military mosques in Jakarta. **********''Suharto has been very active, rounding up support wherever he can find it,'' said a senior Clinton Administration official. **********Another Administration official said Mr. Suharto ''knows that he can't be president again, but he is going to make sure that his kids and his cash survive whatever comes.'' **********Daniel Lev, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and an expert on Indonesia, said the Suhartos ''are doing what comes very naturally: they have the wherewithal to buy political support, and I suspect that is in fact what they are trying to do.'' **********Despite the collapse of the Indonesian currency, the Suharto family is still among the richest on earth. **********After his resignation on May 21, Mr. Suharto went into seclusion for a few weeks, rarely emerging from his Jakarta home and seeing few visitors apart from his six children. He was reported to be depressed and shocked at his ouster after 32 years of iron-fisted rule. **********But diplomats in Jakarta and Administration officials with access to intelligence reports say that his isolation is over and that he has worked aggressively behind the scenes to restore his contacts with political, military and religious leaders. **********His family appears eager, they say, to influence next week's selection of Golkar's new leaders, who in turn will control the actions of the party's 325 members in the 500-seat House of Representatives and the selection of the party's candidates in the next national election. **********While the House of Representatives has been a rubber stamp for the President in the past, the recent political chaos in Indonesia suggests that it may not be in the future. ''The Suhartos want to buy up the loyalty of as many legislators as they can,'' a Clinton Administration official said. ''It's their best hope for survival.'' **********Rumors that Mr. Suharto would seek a return to public life -- and might even try to take power again as President with the help of the army -- have swirled through Jakarta virtually since the day he stepped down. **********Military leaders have been forced to deny publicly that they are helping him return to power. **********At a news conference on Monday, General Wiranto, the armed forces commander, acknowledged that he and other senior officers remained ''close'' to President Suharto. But Gen. Wiranto insisted that the situation does not ''imply the existence of secret or hidden ties,'' nor that the military would help Mr. Suharto return to the presidency. **********Mr. Suharto was succeeded by his Vice President, B. J. Habibie. While Mr. Habibie was considered a protege of the former President, it is unclear what sort of relationship exists between the two today. **********In recent weeks President Habibie has taken some actions that appear to be favors to his predecessor, including his decision last month to dismiss Attorney General Sujono Atmonegoro after Mr. Atmonegoro announced that he was organizing an investigation of the wealth of former government officials, apparently including Mr. Suharto. **********But other actions by Mr. Habibie appear to be snubs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/08/world/third-of-births-aren-t-registered-unicef-says.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1998-07-08", "snippet": "Unicef reports some one-third of all babies do not have their births registered, leaving them in official limbo that can mean missed educational opportunities and health care; calls right to official identity 'first right;' Unicef executive direct...", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Third of Births Aren't Registered, Unicef Says", "print_headline": "Third of Births Aren't Registered, Unicef Says", "body_text": " **********Perhaps one-third of all babies do not have their births registered, leaving them in an official limbo that can mean missed educational opportunities and health care, Unicef says in a new report. **********''Without proof of birth a child cannot be legally vaccinated in at least 20 countries,'' said the report, to be published on Wednesday by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. ''More than 30 countries require birth registration before a child can be treated in a health center. Most countries demand to see a birth certificate before enrolling a child in school.'' **********The report, ''The Progress of Nations 1998,'' calls the birth certificate a crucial piece of paper, ''proof of what might be called the 'first right,' the right to an official identity.'' **********The executive director of Unicef, Carol Bellamy, said in an interview  on Monday that the organization began to focus on birth registration because of a series of experiences. Unicef officials saw Rwandan refugee children being thrown into adult camps with men who had carried out genocidal attacks, but Unicef found it hard to separate them because they had no proof of ages. **********More generally, immunization campaigns often uncovered previously uncounted children, she said. And work with street children revealed the difficulties inherent in finding them schools if they did not have birth certificates. The missing information locally led to the worldwide survey. **********''If a third of the children who are born every year are in essence nonexistent in the eyes of states, then it puts them at risk,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ''Not having a birth certificate is the functional equivalent of not having been born.'' **********The lack of certificates allows children to be more easily exploited as child labor or sex workers, she said. **********Unicef found that registration was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and some Asian nations, notably India and Myanmar, where a half to a third of births were registered, and Cambodia, which had no registration system at all. Vietnam did not have enough data to make even an educated guess. **********Poverty alone does not determine the level of registration, the report found, citing high registration rates in most of Latin America, central Asia and North Africa. **********Ms. Bellamy acknowledged that many figures in the study, which point to 40 million unregistered births a year, were based on estimates.

Tuesday, about 80 percent of the nation's almost 50 million pagers stopped working. National Public Radio's flagship program, ''All Things Considered,'' went dead in much of the country. People who rely on electronic data services for news and information suddenly found themselves without the numbers they needed. **********Many were still expressing surprise yesterday over how a $250 million satellite, owned by the Panamsat Corporation of Greenwich, Conn., had illustrated American dependence on arcane electronic communications. [Page D3.] **********The inconvenience caused by the failure, which could last until early next week, was widespread. The sense of inconvenience even extended to people paid to understand the vulnerability of modern communications. **********''Last night I paged my husband to say 'What do you want me to pick up for dinner?' '' said Suzanne E. Stein, a wireless communications analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''I paged him four times, and I was so angry that he didn't return my call that I was like, 'I'm going to divorce you if you don't page me back right now.' '' **********Ms. Stein is still married. But the problem, which Panamsat said yesterday could take as long as six days to resolve by moving another satellite into Galaxy 4's orbital slot, led to other sorts of threats. **********On Tuesday night, an Alamo rental car branch near Newark received a bomb threat. The Newark Police Department tried to page members of its bomb squad, but ''not all of the individuals in the bomb squad that were paged were aware that they were paged,'' said Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the department. Dispatchers eventually were able to track them down, he added. **********Also Tuesday night, a man was stuck in an elevator in a Chicago office building. If Galaxy 4 had been working, he could have been rescued within 15 minutes. Instead, the man had to wait for two hours because the failed satellite disabled the pagers used by a local elevator repair company. **********''We had someone two blocks away, but we couldn't get hold of him,'' said Ron Lamb, a supervisor for Montgomery Kone Inc., the repair company. ''It's a good thing no one got sick or had a heart attack or was injured, or we really would've had a major, major problem.'' **********There have, however, been enough problems to go around since Tuesday night for many people and businesses that communicate electronically. Among the hardest hit have been some smaller companies that depend on the transmission and receipt of up-to-the-second financial data. Without the deep pockets and extensive plans necessary to move quickly to other modes of communication, they spent yesterday and some of Tuesday practically out of business. **********''Basically, our data were undeliverable,'' said Craig McIntosh, director of market data services for the Data Transmission Network Corporation, a company based in Omaha that provides financial and agricultural news and information to 160,000 subscribers, most of whom use Galaxy 4. ''We've received thousands of phone calls today to our customer service department. It hasn't been fun.'' **********James M. Tanner, president of Wall Street on Demand Inc., a company based in Boulder, Colo., that provides financial research on line, said that having spent large amounts on ''redundant'' communications systems that have built-in backups, he was more embarrassed than angry. In his shock he echoed Panamsat officials, paging executives and everyday consumers. **********''We go up to the roof of our building and see four satellite dishes and think, 'Hey, we're redundant,' '' he said. ''But we never thought that they were all pointed at the same satellite and that it might fail. We all have power backups, server backups, computer room backups, even vendor backups, and this is just one thing that no one ever thought about.'' **********Panamsat executives said last night that they still were not sure what caused Galaxy 4 to malfunction. The nation's large paging companies began shifting their operations to other satellites -- a tedious process that involves manually redirecting thousands of satellite dish antennas nationwide. **********''We believe we put into place an effective contingency plan that will meet our customer service requirements,'' said Daniel Marcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, which is owned by the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors. John P. Frazee Jr., the chairman of Paging Network Inc., the nation's largest paging company with about 10.4 million customers, said that 50 to 60 percent of the company's customers, mostly in big cities, would have service by this morning and that 90 percent of the users would have service by this weekend. **********''I don't know if it's been traumatic,'' Mr. Frazee said. ''But it has been sobering.'' **********Francis P. Fisher, director of engineering at WVPN, a public radio station in Charleston, W. Va., used stronger language. **********''It's devastating to us,'' he said. ''We not only obtain our programming from N.P.R. via this satellite, we also distribute our signal throughout West Virginia via the same satellite. So we we're dead in the water.'' **********Siriol Evans, a spokeswoman for National Public Radio, said that most of the network's 600 affiliates subscribed to ''All Things Considered'' and that all the subscribers were cut off when Galaxy 4 malfunctioned. **********Mr. Fisher said, ''It's been very annoying because we didn't have any advance warning.'' Panamsat did, however, say in a filing with Federal regulators last week that it had detected problems with Galaxy 4. **********Among the other companies that have detected problems in Galaxy 4 are United Press International, Reuters America and the Chevron Corporation, which lost the use of ''swipe at the pump'' credit card payment operations at 5,400 gas stations. **********But some people still saw a silver lining in the digital darkness. **********Outside an office building in Chicago yesterday, Joe Knebl was thankful for his pager's silence. **********''I think it's a blessing,'' he said.

The police arrested at least four people and fired water canon to break up demonstrations downtown and in front of the British Embassy.

The next clip showed red, white and blue balloons flying from some office windows of the Chilean Congress in celebration of General Pinochet's birthday. **********The proceedings of the House of Lords today were televised live here, and the reaction to the ruling was sharp and agitated at the headquarters of the Pinochet Foundation, a group dedicated to promoting the former dictator's legacy. Several people burst into tears, and others took out their frustrations at visiting journalists. Some tossed glasses of water at the reporters and photographers, while others pushed and kicked a television cameraman. **********The mood cheered up somewhat by nightfall, when more than 2,000 supporters of the general gathered street outside the foundation to celebrate the general's birthday. As the crowd sang patriotic songs, venders old ''Thank You Pinochet'' head bands, ''I Love You Pinochet'' T-shirts, Chilean flags and ice cream. **********Through the evening the crowd chanted, ''As long as Chile exists, it will never be Marxist.'' Meanwhile people carried posters that attached ''British neocolonialism,'' a phrase that at another time might sound Marxist. **********''I feel sadness, pain, hurt, because my rights as a citizen of a democratic sovereign country have been squashed,'' Maria Inex Martinez, 50, a public relations executive, said.

One evening in 1976, for example, I went putt-putting around the streets of Monaco in a Mini-Cooper, not much more than a motorized garden shed, following the same course that the world's best racing drivers would take the next day in their Formula One cars. **********Now you can follow those same tire tracks in a much higher-performance machine, with the scenery flashing by a lot faster. Just don't expect to park it and walk to a Riviera beach. Auto-racing simulation games on CD-ROM can transport you to almost any speedway in the world and let you sit in the same cars used by the champions Michael Andretti (Indy racing), Jeff Gordon (stock cars) or Michael Schumacher (Formula One). **********As in big-time motor sports, however, the players with the most expensive equipment have a much better time of it. I tested each of these games on a Gateway with a 266-megahertz Pentium II chip, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 64-bit 3-D graphics card with 4 MB of RAM. **********To get the most enjoyment from these games, you will need a steering-wheel controller with separate accelerator and brake pedals. (Steering tillers, racing's version of the joystick, went out with Henry Ford.) A serviceable model in the $50-to-$60 range is the Mad Catz, which also lets you change gears with either a shift lever, like the ones stock-car and Indy-car drivers use, or steering-wheel buttons, like the ones found in Formula One. **********The three games reviewed here are each licensed by one of the three major sanctioning groups for auto racing. (None of the three games are available for Macintosh, but there is a Mac version of Nascar Racing, the precursor to the Sierra game.) All of them offer various driver's aids for rookies, like automatic shifting, steering help to keep you off the crash wall and even damage-free accidents; you can wean yourself from the help as you get better. The race-driving tutorials accompanying each game vary in depth. Microsoft's CART CD-ROM, which offers animated charts and video clips along with text, is good enough that anyone thinking of attending a real-world racing school would probably benefit by working with this game first. **********Would-be race engineers can fiddle with suspension setups, transmission gear ratios and aerodynamic aids, then see how each change affects the car's performance. The CART and Formula One games are particularly realistic (and therefore complex) in this regard. **********The bottom line, however, is the quality of the racing experience each game offers. It's best to remember that real racers drive by the seat of their pants -- literally. The seat, a driver's biggest point of contact with the car, is the main way the driver senses how the car is handling. No CD-ROM can duplicate going through a turn and feeling 3 G's of lateral acceleration. **********Graphically, though, two of these games left me experiencing the same thing the three-time Formula One champion Jackie Stewart felt several years ago during the Monaco Grand Prix: car sickness.

The company has emphasized deep content and information about music through various sites devoted to genres such as Rocktropolis and Jazz Central Station, as well as sites devoted to individual artists like Leonard Bernstein. All of these sites are linked to Music Boulevard, its on-line store. Playing off the experience of its founders, N2K had started a record label as preparation for the day when music could be downloaded directly to users, bypassing CD manufacturing altogether. But recently, the company pulled back from this business, halted the signing of new artists and laid off some staff. **********CD Now was founded by Jason and Mathew Olim, 29-year-old twins. Its business has been much more streamlined, emphasizing a simple,  fast way to buy music. Increasingly, it has added tools to help users find music they like by showing them choices of other people who have similar tastes. **********CD Now has been much more aggressive in signing up ''affiliates'' --  that is, other web sites about music -- often run by fans, that refer surfers to their store in return for a commission. CD Now has 100,000 affiliates, while N2K has about 7,000. **********Both companies offer essentially the same stock because they both use the same wholesale distribution concern, Valley Record Distributors, to warehouse the CD's and ship them to their clients. **********CD Now is bigger, with sales of $11 million in the last quarter. N2K had sales of $10 million, but it is growing faster. CD Now said it has 569,000 customers and N2K said it has 522,000 customers. **********Each of the two companies has raised money in public stock offerings and spent much of it to secure the rights to be the exclusive music seller on various Internet Portal sites. **********CD Now is on Yahoo and Lycos, while N2K is on America Online, Excite and Netscape. **********Combined, the two companies would have about 45 percent of the on-line music market, according to industry estimates.

It is still not over. **********Tragically for the people of Rwanda, both Hutu and Tutsi, their moment of greatest peril occurred too close to the United States debacle in  Somalia, in which 18 American soldiers died, setting off a political storm in Washington. **********At the time, the Clinton Administration was concerned that there was no clear strategy, viable goal or exit plan for a military mission in Rwanda. It was also divided over how to respond to fast-moving events, with Madeleine K. Albright, then the American representative at the United Nations, arguing for some kind of international response, and the Pentagon and White House opposing any United Nations peacekeeping force. **********Ms. Albright ultimately prevailed, but the force created was a very small one of only 270 troops. She has since said repeatedly -- most recently in December on a visit to Africa as Secretary of State -- that the United States and other Western nations did too little too late in Rwanda. **********A senior United Nations official said this week that Washington had been ''absolutely paralyzed by Somalia.'' Other nations, already mired in Bosnia, were also reluctant to intervene in the small Central African country. **********''The Security Council was traumatized by what had happened,'' a European diplomat recalled, ''but Washington was more traumatized than the others.'' **********Mr. Clinton is not expected to name any country today for a failure to act, but diplomats involved in the United Nations debate in 1994 say they now doubt, despite all the praise and promises of economic assistance for Africa now, that Washington would join or support a peacekeeping operation if a similar crisis arose. **********Rwanda descended into genocide in 1994 after years of ethnic tensions. A guerrilla army, the Rwandese Patriotic Front, had been attacking from Uganda. In August 1993, an agreement between the country's minority Tutsi, represented by the front, and the Hutu majority promised to end the ethnic war and introduce a power-sharing system. **********By the fall of that year, the Rwanda agreement was already in danger, and the United Nations sent a peacekeeping mission to the country. But early in 1994, the United Nations commander in Kigali warned that Hutu militias were plotting to kill large numbers of Tutsi. **********The Security Council, with the United States as its most powerful member, did not act. On April 6 and in the weeks that followed, those Hutu plans were put into horrific effect. The trigger was a plane crash, which many believe to have been an act of sabotage, that killed Rwanda's Hutu President, Juvenal Habyarimana, along with the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. **********Among those who died in the rampage that followed were 10 Belgian peacekeepers guarding the Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The peacekeepers had laid down their arms only to be butchered, as she was. Belgium decided to withdraw all its troops. On April 21, the Security Council dramatically cut the peacekeeping force to a bare 270 soldiers. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Tutsi were trying to flee the country to Tanzania as their communities -- and those of Hutu opposed to the massacres -- were decimated. **********Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, called the Security Council action at the time ''a thin veil over another massacre.'' **********Late in April and into May, as the toll of massacred Tutsi mounted into the hundreds of thousands, Bourtos Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations, went repeatedly to the Security Council to ask for a credible force for Rwanda. **********When the Council finally agreed to a force of 5,500, the United States and other Western nations balked, and Washington forced the United Nations to delay sending any soldiers until there were moves toward an end to the violence. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali, trying vainly to recruit Africans or anyone else for a force, called the situation ''a scandal.'' Eventually, Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal volunteered. **********Events then moved beyond the Security Council. As the Tutsi-led guerrillas of the Rwandese Patriotic Front began a march of conquest across Rwanda, France decided to field a force, which established sanctuaries in southwestern Rwanda, largely for Hutu fleeing the R.P.F. **********Many more Hutu chose flight. By mid-July 1.5 million refugees had entered what was then Zaire, which is now Congo. **********Again the United Nations asked the Security Council for help. Although Washington was prepared to provide some relief aid, the Administration turned a deaf ear to pleas from Sadako Ogata, High Commissioner for Refugees, for a force in the camps to separate out Hutu leaders who had committed acts of genocide and who would no doubt rearm for a return to Rwanda. **********''We asked for help in getting those people out of the camps,'' Mrs. Ogata told an audience at the Holocaust Museum in Washington last year. ''No country offered to get help. My staff had to continue feeding criminals as the price for feeding hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children.'' **********The rearming took place as predicted. By late 1996, when the pro-Tutsi forces of Laurent Kabila, now Congo's President, were emptying the camps of Hutu and forcing them back into Rwanda, a Canadian-led  mission to provide security for the displaced was only reluctantly supported and then in effect undermined by the United States. **********Tens of thousands of Rwandans are still missing, Mrs. Ogata said recently. She believes that they perished in the absence of a protection force. Mr. Kabila's Government, now being wooed by the United States, is blocking investigations into reports of massacres by victorious Tutsis or their supporters among his troops. **********To bring the story full circle, Hutu gangs are now killing Tutsi again in remote areas of Rwanda, and Hutu in turn are being attacked by Rwandan Government troops."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/world/clinton-urges-netanyahu-and-arafat-to-take-risks.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1998-10-16", "snippet": "Pres Clinton urges Israeli and Palestinian leaders to break logjam in peace talks and take risks required to bring new hope to their peoples; promises his own intense involvement as Prime Min Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat go to Wye Conference Center ...", "word_count": 1148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Urges Netanyahu And Arafat to Take Risks", "print_headline": "Clinton Urges Netanyahu And Arafat to Take Risks", "body_text": " **********President Clinton, promising his own intense involvement to secure agreement, today urged the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to ''break the logjam'' and take the risks required to provide new hope to their peoples. **********Opening a four-day summit meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, Mr. Clinton warned that ''too much time has already been lost'' in the search for an interim accord that will provide the Palestinians an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian steps to fight terrorism. **********''Concessions that seem hard now will seem far less important in the light of an accord that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting peace,'' Mr. Clinton said in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the two Middle East leaders. **********This afternoon Mr. Clinton traveled to the Wye Conference Center near Queenstown, Md., on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, where Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat have agreed to be isolated in comfort, with their aides and American officials, in the hopes of finishing the interim deal, now long overdue. **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will continually be at the center. Mr. Clinton said he would go there as needed. **********Although American and Israeli officials said much hard work remained, failure on a long-delayed interim accord would be embarrassing to President Clinton just before the Nov. 3 elections. More importantly it would leave the peace effort on the verge of collapse seven months before May 4, when the Israelis and Palestinians are supposed to have completed their final agreement. **********Mr. Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood unilaterally if May 4 passes without a final settlement. **********Mr. Netanyahu and Israel's opposition Labor Party have warned him against such a step. **********But senior American officials acknowledged that Mr. Arafat had to have ''something concrete'' to point to by then, with talks on a final settlement proceeding well. **********A main task at the talks in Maryland, the American officials said, in addition to finishing the interim agreement for the 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in return for specific Palestinian antiterrorism steps, is to find a way to avoid a more fundamental crisis in seven months. **********If the interim deal can be achieved here, after more than 19 months of stalemate, talks on a permanent settlement will immediately restart. **********Natan Sharansky, one of Mr. Netanyahu's closest advisers in the Cabinet, said in an interview today that ''no date is sacred'' and that it could take two years for a final settlement to be negotiated. **********The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, called that unacceptable. Mr. Sharansky tried to play down the stakes for the meeting here, saying Israel could not accept any agreement just to have one. **********''We are coming to a summit where expectations are so high,'' he said. ''Yet the most outstanding issues are not resolved. While what we in Israel have to give is clear, what we are to get is not.'' **********The main issues for the Israelis are Palestinian steps to improve security, fight the radical Islamic Hamas movement and stop public and private ''incitement'' of violence against the Israelis. **********An important part of the private violence issue, Mr. Sharansky said, is requiring a public change in the Palestinian charter to remove clauses calling for the destruction of Israel. **********''I want it to be hard for Arafat,'' Mr. Sharansky said. ''I want him to have to argue for such a change. To me the heart of the question is not the percentage of land we give, but to change the charter.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu was cautious, saying, ''We come with the best intentions and we hope that there will be an accord.'' **********Mr. Arafat was optimistic. But he again mourned Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by an Israeli extremist. He reminded Mr. Netanyahu, in a reiteration of their long argument about whether peace flows from security or vice-versa, that ''peace is the most important platform for security, and he has to remember this and not to forget that some of his extremist gangsters have killed my partner Rabin.'' **********The old arguments are a prime reason why American officials want to isolate the leaders from outsiders, in particular from the press, and force them to concentrate in secrecy on the hard bargaining needed for a deal. The Wye Center, set amid dense woods along the unspoiled Wye River some 70 miles from Washington, was the next best choice, and a far more elegant one, after the Israelis rejected the Presidential retreat at Camp David in the Maryland hills. Israeli officials did not want the comparison to the 1978 marathon sessions there that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. **********This afternoon at the Wye Center, Mr. Clinton said that the Americans were ''ready to do whatever we can.'' He urged all sides to focus on the talks only. **********''Therefore we have agreed to confine our dealings with the media to periodic briefings to be conducted by spokespersons,'' he said. **********But the spokesmen like James P. Rubin of the State Department have pledged to say as little as possible. **********Mr. Sharansky joked that he was hesitating to enter the conference Center ''because I'm afraid they won't let me out again.'' **********But his presence, combined with the arrival on Friday of the new Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, is a sign of Mr. Netanyahu's seriousness. The three figures make up the ''kitchen cabinet'' and must themselves agree if Mr. Netanyahu has any chance of getting a deal through his Cabinet. **********Mr. Sharon and Mr. Mordechai remained in Israel an additional day for a commemoration of a famous tank battle in the 1973 war. Mr. Sharon will fly directly to Rochester, Minn., where King Hussein of Jordan is undergoing cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic, for a visit before joining Mr. Netanyahu at the Wye Center. **********But with the Israeli delegation unable to work after sundown on Friday because of the Sabbath, American officials acknowledge that the time is short for the breakthrough that Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright want so badly. **********Among the issues to be settled include a third shift of Israeli troops due under previous accords, a move quite likely to be settled by a panel on borders at the final-status talks after they have begun. **********There are also arguments about how Palestinians will travel unhindered between the West Bank and Gaza, with the Israelis suggesting buses and even trains. The Palestinians insist on being able to travel in individual cars. An airport and an industrial park in Gaza are essentially settled, but security questions remain on a planned seaport. **********The real danger of the summit meeting, said Stephen Cohen, vice chairman of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, is that ''everyone will settle for a very little thing that they call an agreement and that resolves nothing in the region.'' He urged Mr. Clinton ''to aim high,'' saying, ''A fairy-tale agreement about too little will not solve the problems.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/business/fox-gets-deal-to-distribute-star-wars.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1998-04-03", "snippet": "George Lucas's movie company, Lucasfilm Ltd, announces that next three films in 'Star Wars' series, one of most powerful franchises ever produced, will be distributed by 20th Century Fox, film division of News Corp; first new 'Star Wars' film, whi...", "word_count": 311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fox Gets Deal To Distribute 'Star Wars'", "print_headline": "Fox Gets Deal To Distribute 'Star Wars'", "body_text": " **********George Lucas's movie company announced today that the next three films in its ''Star Wars'' series, one of the most powerful movie franchises ever produced, would be distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film division of the News Corporation. **********The announcement was no surprise, since the first three ''Star Wars'' movies were distributed by Fox, but it was good news for the studio, currently basking in the success of ''Titanic,'' which it helped finance and distribute. **********Fox will earn less on these films than it would ordinarily make because Mr. Lucas's company, Lucasfilm Ltd., will retain ownership, and because Lucasfilm will also retain the rights to license and sell merchandise, an enormously profitable business.

It said officials nonetheless ''neglected taking measures to distinguish looted gold from other gold holdings of the Reichsbank.'' **********Over all, the report estimated that Switzerland's central bank had bought gold worth $280 million in wartime dollars from the Nazis, or more than $2.5 billion at today's prices. While not providing a full estimate of so-called victim gold -- that taken from those sent to death and concentration camps -- the report said gold worth about $134,000 in wartime dollars, more than $1.2 million today, was sent to Swiss banks. **********Although the report held no surprises, it immediately fueled further rancor between Swiss officials and American Jewish groups that have been pressing Switzerland to pay into a global settlement to atone for the wartime trade and to compensate Holocaust survivors and the heirs of Holocaust victims. **********The Swiss National Bank has so far refused to join the country's commercial banks in negotiating a settlement with Jewish groups. A senior Government official, Thomas Borer, who heads the Swiss Government task force on the issue, said today that the Government ''won't take part in any settlement that involves taxpayers' money.'' **********''The report says clearly the Swiss government and the Swiss National Bank did not know that it was victims' gold,'' Mr. Borer said in an interview today. ''No one could know because the gold was melted into normal ingots.'' **********Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, the leading voice for global reparations, said by telephone: ''They know now.  It's a moral stain on Switzerland if they create a commission and don't act on its conclusions.'' **********Mr. Borer maintained that there was nothing in the report that warranted reopening of the 1946 Washington agreement under which Switzerland turned over some gold obtained during the war. The Federal Council, Switzerland's governing body, issued a statement today ruling out revisiting the 1946 accord on grounds that ''the Allies were informed extensively from the very beginning'' on the gold transactions. **********Urging the Swiss to make restitution for victims' gold, Mr. Steinberg said, ''Switzerland shouldn't act dishonorably just because the Allies did 50 years ago.'' **********The report said that Swiss National Bank officials were so uneasy about the prospect of wartime trafficking in looted gold that they considered melting it down to disguise its origin. That idea was later abandoned as ''impractical.'' **********The report also provided details of exactly where some of the victims' gold came from. An SS captain, Bruno Melmer, had responsibility for collecting gold from some concentration and death camp victims, including those at Auschwitz and Birkenau. **********The Melmer gold sent to Switzerland was a portion of all victim gold. **********The panel criticized Switzerland's past justifications for those wartime gold purchases, particularly that the country had to accept Nazi gold to stave off an occupation by Hitler's forces. This reasoning was advanced late in the war, in 1943, the report said, showing that ''it was an argument cobbled together to justify the previous gold policy.'' **********The Swiss National Bank, in a statement today, said it ''regrets most profoundly that in accepting gold deliveries from the Reichsbank it may unwittingly also have acquired gold deriving from victims of concentration camps.'' **********The report, more than a year in the making, will be made available at bookstores and on the Internet shortly, the panel said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/05/business/worldbusiness/IHT-the-internet-needs-light-regulation.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "1998-06-05", "snippet": "For music lovers in, say, London or Paris, it is often easier and cheaper to order compact disks via the Internet from the United States, and to have them delivered by express mail, than to buy them in a local store..Soon customers will be able to...", "word_count": 3748, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Internet Needs Light Regulation", "print_headline": "The Internet Needs Light Regulation", "body_text": " **********For music lovers in, say, London or Paris, it is often easier and cheaper to order compact disks via the Internet from the United States, and to have them delivered by express mail, than to buy them in a local store. **********Soon customers will be able to cut out the mailman as well as the store by creating disks on their own computers with music downloaded from the Internet. **********The first kind of transaction, in which a package actually moves from one country to another, should, at least in theory, be subject to import duties.

He promised 6 trillion yen, or roughly $41 billion, in overall tax cuts next year, effectively making permanent the 4 trillion yen in temporary cuts for individuals that Mr. Hashimoto extended this year. **********He pledged to lower the maximum combined local and national income tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent, the first step toward what he hopes will be a comprehensive reworking of the tax system. **********And borrowing another page from Mr. Hashimoto's book, he said he would lower the corporate tax rate to 40 percent from 46.3 percent starting in April, bringing it roughly in line with Western levels. **********Economists and business leaders have long criticized Japan's high taxes for inhibiting entrepreneurs and forcing dynamic individuals to move to other countries. ''I paid 200 million yen in taxes last year,'' Takuya Okada, chairman and chief executive of Jusco Ltd., one of Japan's largest retailers, fumed recently. **********The temporary tax cut he got this spring returned just 18,000 yen to him, which ''did not really inspire me to spend,'' he said. ''Now, if they cut my income tax to 50 percent, then I might think about spending,'' he added. Few economists, though, say a tax cut will put the economy on a path to lasting recovery. **********''Tax cuts are necessary because bankruptcies are increasing and unemployment is spiraling up,'' said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders in Tokyo. ''But it's not going to start a consumer-led recovery.'' **********Neither will corporate tax cuts necessarily stimulate capital investment. Only 35 to 40 percent of Japanese corporations pay taxes, and the low cost of capital -- companies can borrow at around 1 percent -- offsets the tax burden for those companies doing well enough to have to pay taxes. **********While economists welcome a corporate cut, many say the tax structure itself is in need of a fix. ''Companies now get tax breaks for certain types of investment that made sense a long time ago, but, given changes in technology and the economy, now make no sense,'' Mr. Young said. **********Voters, however, are demanding something that makes sense. Mr. Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost control of the Upper House of Parliament when voters turned out in unexpected droves on June 12 to vent their anger. Popularity ratings for Mr. Obuchi and his Cabinet are so low that commentators see a bright side: they probably cannot get any worse. **********The loss of the Upper House threatens to stall the passage of legislation to revamp the debt-ridden banking system, and foreign investors will continue to punish the stock market and the yen until they see evidence that change is for real. **********Mr. Obuchi is well aware of that, and he was at his most eloquent when speaking about the financial sector. ''The flow of funds is like the blood of society, and the financial institutions that are responsible for its circulation assume the role of the heart,'' he said. ''A partial failure of the financial sector, therefore, might lead to a systemic crisis.'' **********Nonetheless, he left lingering doubts about the Government's ability to swallow the strong medicine of failed banks and falling asset prices that would accompany a banking system overhaul. At a news conference after the speech, Akitaka Saiki, Mr. Obuchi's deputy press secretary, was pressed about whether the Prime Minister would allow insolvent banks to fail. Foreign investors are all but baying for a bank failure as a sign that the Government is serious about cleaning up the system. **********''We don't intend to save bad banks,'' Mr. Saiki said. ''They need to take responsibility for their actions.'' **********The only specific long-term goal Mr. Obuchi proposed was to push through measures that would cut the Government payroll by 20 percent over the next decade and cut Government costs by 30 percent, both ideas that have been floated for years. **********Mr. Obuchi plans to pay for tax cuts by issuing deficit bonds, a financing technique all but prohibited by last year's Fiscal Structural Reform Act. That law severely limited Mr. Hashimoto's ability to maneuver when the economy started sliding toward recession late last fall, and the Prime Minister said today that he would submit legislation in the fall to suspend that law. **********He also proposed a supplemental spending budget of 10 trillion yen, or about $69 billion. That will come on top of 16 trillion yen put together in the spring by Mr. Hashimoto, meaning that Japan will spend more than 4 percent of its gross domestic product this year trying to get its economy going again with public works projects. ''This is an amazingly big set of packages by any standards,'' Professor Takenaka said. **********Mr. Saiki, the Prime Minister's spokesman, said Mr. Obuchi intended to spend this money somewhat differently from the way such budgets have been spent in the past, when they largely went to building bridges, transportation facilities and roadways that kept the politically loyal and labor-intensive construction industry afloat when the bubble economy started losing air. **********Mr. Obuchi, he added, wants a bigger portion of the new supplemental budget spent on ''industries of the future,'' like medicine and technology. **********Those industries are considered the best hope for putting a plug in rising unemployment, which is a source of continuing discomfort for politicians, who consider it a ticking time bomb that could blast them out of office. **********But economists see higher unemployment as painful but necessary, for it means companies are trying to increase productivity and profitability, which makes them more competitive globally. **********And even Mr. Saiki said that if deregulation proceeded, Japan may face more unemployment in the short term. ''The structure of the economy has to be changed,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/business/l-money-isn-t-everything-especially-in-retirement-491225.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-10-25", "snippet": "James H Chapman letter lauds Fred Brock's October 4 column on money needed for retirement (S)", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Isn't Everything, Especially in Retirement", "print_headline": "Money Isn't Everything, Especially in Retirement", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Re ''When Enough Really Is Enough'' (Seniority, Oct. 4), in which Fred Brock discussed how retirees don't need huge nest eggs -- the kind recommended by many mutual fund companies -- in order to lead happy, fulfilling lives: **********After reading so many articles, with substantive charts and graphs, in yours and other publications as to why one needs so many big bucks tucked away for retirement, it was gratifying to see your column  -- especially its description of Elton Pasea,  who lives quite nicely on $1,200 a month in a small town in Texas. **********I have always assumed that there are more Elton Paseas in this world than people  with seven-figure nest eggs who still worry about running out of money before death. **********JAMES H.

And these voices contend that we can manage our economic destiny differently -- and for the better -- for the middle class. **********No less a corporate leader than Henry B. Schacht, chairman of Lucent Technologies, asserts simply that the cost-cutting, bottom-line fever that has powered Wall Street and corporate America in the 1990's cannot last. ''This is going to blow up in our faces,'' warns Mr. Schacht, who earned more than $1.5 million last year and holds over $34 million worth of uncashed Lucent stock options. ''There is no way a society can have this much of its accumulated wealth distributed to these few people.'' **********To those who say the middle class shares fully in America's prosperity, Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley, replies: ''I am hard-pressed to believe that this is a period when we've got a rising tide that has lifted all boats. There are millions of workers who have never seen the harbor let alone even know what a boat looks like.'' **********John H. Dasburg, chief executive of Northwest Airlines, adds: ''Democracy didn't work without certain rights being guaranteed, what we call a Bill of Rights. And in my view there is somewhat a bill of rights to capitalism. You just simply must take into consideration all of the various interests in society in the enterprise. And if you fail to do that, capitalism will fail.'' **********These are minority viewpoints for now. But there is no denying that Mssrs. Schacht, Roach and Dasburg are charter members of the free-market club, and from that vantage point, these leading business spokesmen warn that the economic payoff in the 1990's has been so skewed to the upper brackets that our prosperity is in danger. **********In the era of the so-called people's market, Federal Reserve statistics show that 60 percent of Americans own no stock at all -- no 401(k) plan, no mutual funds, no pension stock, nothing. Analysis by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dartmouth College tell us that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own nearly 50 percent of all stock; the bottom 80 percent own only 3 percent. While most Americans are better off today than in the recession of 1990-91, average household income in real terms is still not up to the 1989 level. **********The warning from Mr. Roach, among others, is that unless American capitalism does a better job of sharing the wealth, a political backlash is coming from the so-called middle middle of America. **********MR. SCHACHT'S ideas for reducing income inequality and for tempering the wild scramble for short-term payoffs on Wall Street include letting the traders trade but denying them the voting rights of ownership for two years. He would also raise the progressive income tax rates and lower capital gains taxes on a sliding scale to zero, based on the investment's duration. **********''You cannot have the very few of us making these enormous amounts of money and a large number of folks feeling that the system of which they are the majority is treating them less fairly than they feel is equitable,'' Mr. Schacht argues. **********Mr. Dasburg's answer has been to include Northwest's employees as genuine partners in the enterprise, pursue labor-management cooperation and share decision making as well as more of the profits. When Northwest verged on bankruptcy in 1993, he says, it was the giveback of $900 million in wages and work-rule concessions by pilots, machinists, flight attendants and ground personnel that saved it. In return, employees got 30 percent ownership and three seats on the board. **********Other power-sharing arrangements have enabled Northwest to keep more than $100 million of work in-house rather than outsourcing it. **********Such examples are still unusual but hardly unique. United Airlines, Allied Signal and U.S. Sugar have bet on employee ownership and power-sharing. In more than 1,000 American corporations, employees hold more than 20 percent ownership and have both profit-sharing and some decision-making power. **********Sitting far away in Manhattan, the corporate ownership of the Hathaway Shirt Company of Waterville, Me., decided two years ago that the business could not compete with third-world imports even after relentless cost-cutting. But people in Maine saw Hathaway as too valuable to the regional economy to be buried for the sake of the short-term bottom line. An investor group rallied to buy the plant, struck a deal with the union, received government bridge financing and hired an experienced chief executive to restore Hathaway's historic quality standards and  to sell the improved shirts to upscale stores. Today, Hathaway thrives. **********In Virginia, the end of the cold war meant the loss of huge Navy contracts and thousands of jobs at the Newport News shipyard. But as the shipbuilding company struggled to find commercial contracts to replace lost Government business, six labor unions banded together to invest millions of dollars of workers' pension money to clinch a huge deal to build oil tankers. That revived the shipyard and 2,000 jobs. **********Such examples reach beyond the bottom line and illustrate the advantages of sharing the gains. They show that we can do much better for the middle class. In the new economy, the prime issue for most Americans is not how many jobs there are, but what kind of jobs, what kinds of lives they let people enjoy and what kind of future is ahead for their children. The test is not survival of the fittest but the fitness of society to provide a greater share of the gains to a larger majority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/25/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/world/hopes-for-peace-talks-dim-as-israel-extends-settlement.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1998-01-01", "snippet": "Defense Min Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel attends cornerstone-laying ceremony for new extension of Jewish settlement at Beit El on West Bank; United States has repeatedly called for 'timeout' on settlement building to smooth path for upcoming talks ...", "word_count": 680, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hopes for Peace Talks Dim As Israel Extends Settlement", "print_headline": "Hopes for Peace Talks Dim As Israel Extends Settlement", "body_text": " **********Despite American calls for a ''timeout'' in settlement building, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel shoveled cement into a hole today for a new extension of this Jewish settlement in the hills north of the Palestinian-ruled town of Ramallah. **********The cornerstone-laying ceremony, a year after a Beit El woman and her son were killed by Palestinian gunmen, signaled the Government's determination to go on expanding settlements despite the American demands. **********Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, are expected to travel to Washington in late January for separate meetings with President Clinton to discuss a further Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and talks on a final peace settlement. **********Secretary of State Madeleine K.

''The people of Beit El have to build their houses here like the people of New York, Paris or Tel Aviv have to build apartments.'' **********''It is agreed with all the elements, including with our American friends, that settlements will be expanded near their fences, contiguously,'' Mr. Mordechai said, referring to the perimeter of the settlements.

We won't be defeated.'' **********But Hanan Ashrawi, a minister in the Palestinian cabinet, called the  Israeli settlement expansion a death-knell for peace efforts. **********''They are not just laying a cornerstone, these are the gravestones of any kind of peace,'' she said.

J. Habibie at which he said they agreed that an electoral assembly would be convened late this year or early next year, followed by an election some time in 1999. **********That 1,000-member assembly is dominated by backers of former President Suharto, who was forced to resign last Thursday after a weeklong occupation of the Parliament building by thousands of students. Opponents fear that the procedures and timetable set forth today will allow Mr. Habibie to consolidate his position, along with the rest of the power structure that was left in place by Mr. Suharto. **********The students were not permitted to enter the grounds of Parliament today. But some 400 demonstrators from 40 universities gathered outside its gates, climbing onto the roofs of buses and waving the red-and-white Indonesian flag. **********''Hang, hang Habibie! Hang Habibie next to Suharto!'' they chanted, to the beat of drums, as some 200 soldiers looked on. **********It was the first demonstration by students in the capital since they were peacefully removed from Parliament a day after Mr. Suharto's resignation. Elsewhere around the country, students have moved to a new stage of action, sitting in at regional parliament offices and city halls to demand local reforms. **********Other students have formed committees to spread their message of democratic reforms among villagers and poor urban residents. **********But as the momentum builds here for political change, with new political parties and labor unions forming and with public figures like Mr. Rais jockeying for position, the students have found themselves groping for a new political role. **********''When Suharto stepped down, many students were confused,'' said Rainer, 21, a student of political science who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''We have no program for our next step. We have never done this before.'' **********But they have not faded from view. For two months after the ritual reannointing of former President Suharto in mid-March, it was the students who refused to accept his continued manipulation of the country as its economy crashed and its people seethed with discontent. **********Many Indonesians still look to them for moral leadership, and they are a force the Government must now take into account as it addresses questions of democracy, free speech and human rights. **********''I admire the students because they are very courageous and, God willing, they always lead the way for the people,'' said Nemin Pustanil Arfin, a minibus driver. ''They are the ones who had the guts to topple Suharto and the faith to fight for the truth.'' **********As for the future, he said, ''I'm going to wait to see what the students do.'' **********The student movement is a curious political force, headless and leaderless, without a central organizing force. During the occupation of Parliament, representatives of more than 40 universities met separately, with little coordination. **********In the Parliament's courtyard, students from the various universities sat in separate groups, sometimes competing to compose naughty chants about Mr. Suharto. Now they are meeting on campuses across the country to discuss whether to support the new President, whether to call for a new election or a special session of the electoral assembly, whether to support individual leaders or broad principles. **********''You cannot call this a movement,'' said Muridan S. Widjojo, an anthropologist who is studying the student protests. ''It is impossible to say the students are unified. The do not have an organization or a structure or an ideology. Some try to embrace the opposition. Some still try to maintain themselves as independent groups. Some are ready to make coalitions with some prominent figures.'' **********As fellow students in jeans and shoulder-length hair lounged on the Salemba campus of the University of Indonesia, strumming guitars and talking politics, Roysepta Abimnanyu, 21, said they hoped to lead a transformation of Indonesia. **********''We don't want this to be just a teen-age movement,'' he said. ''We want this to be a people's movement for better conditions.'' **********This is an extraordinary moment in Indonesia, when all rules seem to have been cast aside. The strongman who held the country in his grip is gone, to be replaced by a President few people fear or expect to remain in office long. **********Political prisoners are being freed and are holding news conferences. The formerly timid press is suddenly one of the freest in Asia. No one can foresee the future course of the nation and many are relying on university students to set the agenda. **********''The most important thing is that the republic of fear has fallen,'' Mr. Widjojo said. ''The fear Suharto created over 32 years is gone. People are free to think what they want and say what they want.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/04/technology/choose-some-good-old-days-and-see-how-they-really-were.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-06-04", "snippet": "Variety of World Wide Web sites enable users to review events of particular day or time period; photo (M)", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Choose Some 'Good Old Days' And See How They Really Were", "print_headline": "Choose Some 'Good Old Days' And See How They Really Were", "body_text": " **********WANT to prove to your wisecracking, history-challenged progeny that ''Roll Over Beethoven'' -- and not old Ludwig himself -- was all the rage when you were born? **********For an instant dose of personal nostalgia, just beam your Web browser to the dMarie Time Capsule (dmarie.com/asp/history.asp).

The desire to hold such a meeting was spelled out by President Bill Clinton in November at the meeting of Asian-Pacific leaders in Vancouver, a U.S. Treasury representative said in Washington. She added that the president had said the meeting of ministers \"from key countries\" would explore \"the implications of the current financial situation in Asia and the ways to deal with these challenges.\" **********As in the postmortems of earlier crises, there will be a call for better information \u2014 more timely, more reliable data on international lending and borrowing. **********But, although more complete information is always desirable, \"it's unrealistic to hope that is a solution; it will not solve everything,\" warned Alexandre Lamfalussy, former head of the Bank for International Settlements. He noted that data published by the BIS had fully signaled the worrisome size of the pile of short-term debt that built up in East Asia and said published warnings from the BIS had been ignored. **********For Mr. Lamfalussy, the key question is \"how to liberalize fully the flow of long-term capital, which is very desirable, without fully liberalizing short-term flows.\" **********Charles Wyplosz at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, another proponent of restraining short-term capital flows, said that the inevitable calls for more data, more reporting and more disclosure were \"politically cheap\" solutions that amount to \"a bureaucratic papering over\" of the fundamental issue. **********He argued that apart from Thailand, which had serious financial problems, a crisis that need not have happened engulfed the rest of East Asia and was magnified once the International Monetary Fund became involved. **********\"My main criticism of the IMF strategy,\" he said, is that it is \"based on the crucial point that it does not want to recommend a moratorium\" on debt repayments. \"Either because it sees itself as an official agency that shouldn't support a strategy that goes against the law,\" Mr. Wyplosz said, \"or because it fears it would be exposed to suit from creditors, the IMF always insists that every debt be repaid.\" In Mr. Wyplosz's view, this requirement not only worsened the Asian crisis but also contributes to the reasons that banks overlend. **********Although banks, he said, charge a premium to lend to risky debtors, this premium is not enough either to cover the real risk of default or to dissuade the debtor from borrowing. Instead, he said, the premium simply increases the attraction of lending to risky clients. **********\"As a result,\" one international official said, \"we get banks doing excessively risky business.\" **********\"The sooner we get banks to accurately charge for the risk,\" he said, \"and the sooner governments get out of the business of implicitly or explicitly guaranteeing the banks, the better off we will all be.\" He added that this inevitably would involve a redesigning of the unofficial safety net that currently prevents large internationally active banks from ever failing. **********He summed up by asking, \"If you do something silly, do you have to pay for it? If you have a system that says 'no,' people will do a lot of things that are silly.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/21/business/the-markets-stocks-markets-rally-after-trading-lower-for-most-of-the-day.html": {"writer_name": "Sharon King", "pub_date": "1998-02-21", "snippet": "Stock market stages comeback, with Dow Jones average closing at 8,413.94, up 33.36 points; graph (S)", "word_count": 539, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Rally After Trading Lower for Most of the Day", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS; Markets Rally After Trading Lower for Most of the Day", "body_text": " **********The stock market staged a comeback yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average returning to positive territory after a decline Thursday snapped a six-day streak of consecutive records. **********Although it was lower throughout most of the day, the blue-chip average rallied, closing at 8,413.94, up 38.36 points, with companies like Merck, American Express and McDonald's among the leading gainers. **********Because of the expiration of stock options and futures, known as ''double witching,'' traders and analysts had anticipated a volatile session. **********While the Dow did rebound from early losses, which pushed it down as much as 57 points, the average failed to beat the high of 8,451.06 reached Wednesday.

From 1994 to the end of 1997, Mr. Cowger was president of GM's Mexican operations, helping make GM the leader in the Mexican market.

''It looks like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape and Sun.'' **********Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand. **********''Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,'' she said. **********Mr. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the E-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising on line. **********''We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said. ''They have an on-line store, but their square footage is too small.'' **********Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been rewriting the software that lets companies open on-line stores to be based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language used only on America Online. This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's on-line store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. **********Similarly, it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make on-line purchases without retyping all that information each time. American Online is working to offer it -- for a fee -- to stores on the broader Internet. **********There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies decide whether and how to sell on line without hurting their traditional sale in stores. There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed, ranging from the on-line stores themselves to connecting those sites to a company's existing inventory and accounting systems. **********There are creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big servers that users connect to when they use the on-line stores that display catalogues, take orders and process payments. **********America Online, Mr. Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather than back-office functions. ''We will consult on how to merchandize and sell on line,'' he said. ''We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle.'' **********Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware. ''The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best possible solution for their business,'' said Robert Gett, the chief executive of Viant. ''If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer is a bit tainted.'' **********Netscape does have an expanding force of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most competitive, Mr. Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web. **********''They say, 'Who knows our software better than Netscape?' '' Mr. Gett said. ''We help customers decide which platform is best for them.'' **********But America Online argues that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs. ''We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and services, is the huge revenue stream of the future,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/05/world/israel-urges-us-to-keep-peace-plan-quiet-but-it-s-already-out.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1998-03-05", "snippet": "Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu has begun intense campaign, deploying Israeli officials and lobbyists, to prevent Clinton Administration from announcing specific proposal for reviving peace talks with Palestinians (M)", "word_count": 527, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Urges U.S. to Keep Peace Plan Quiet, but It's Already Out", "print_headline": "Israel Urges U.S. to Keep Peace Plan Quiet, but It's Already Out", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun an intense campaign, deploying Israeli officials and lobbyists to prevent the Clinton Administration from announcing a specific proposal for reviving peace talks with the Palestinians. **********The Americans, in negotiations with both sides, have been refining their proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in parallel with Palestinian moves against terrorism. But the Israelis are unhappy with the size of the withdrawal suggested and with the reluctance of the Palestinians to move against radical groups. **********The Israelis especially do not want the Americans to disclose their proposal before a compromise can be reached, saying public diplomacy will put unfair pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to accede on security issues. **********Israeli officials, including the Government's spokesman, David Bar-Ilan, are running around Washington seeing reporters, columnists and legislators like the Republican Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas and Jesse Helms of North Carolina. And Mr. Netanyahu is enlisting American Jewish leaders to help stave off a plan that senior American officials swear is neither imminent nor inevitable. This morning White House officials told Uzi Arad, Mr. Netanyahu's national security adviser, that there would be ''no surprises'' in the peace talks. **********A senior Administration official said later, ''Public mediation usually fails.'' But he said that if the stagnation continues, there is a ''logical progression'' that would involve ''getting them to accept our reasonable proposals.'' **********That is best accomplished with private diplomacy, the official said, although the idea of a speech by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright or by President Clinton laying out the proposal has been discussed. **********Israeli officials said they are concerned that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, is trying to block progress in order to push the Americans to intervene more forcefully. **********Since Mr. Netanyahu knows Washington has made no decision to announce its proposal, some American officials say he is trying to limit the size of the American role itself by focusing his big guns now on a minor issue: a public announcement. **********But those guns are blazing, and the White House has heard them. **********On Monday night, at a dinner in Israel for the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, Mr. Netanyahu attacked the idea of American pressure on Israel. ''Only the people of Israel can determine what their security needs are,'' he said, ''and no third parties can impose what it should have as its security needs.'' **********Howard Kohr, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said: ''We believe that a strategy of pressure will be counterproductive for the peace process, leading the Palestinians to look to the United States rather than Israel as their negotiating partner.'' **********Not everyone agrees. Jonathan Jacoby, executive director of Israel Policy Forum, said: ''This fear is unjustified. The Administration is proposing, not imposing.'' **********The outlines of the American proposal, which have in fact been leaked to the news media, include an Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank areas that it controls, in return for parallel Palestinian acts to fight terrorism. At the end of the withdrawal, which would be in third stages over three months, both parties would begin talks on a permanent peace agreement, and Israel would agree to halt expansion of Jewish settlements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/06/world/clinton-trip-fails-to-silence-doubt-on-his-domestic-clout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-09-06", "snippet": "Coverage of slow progress of Pres Clinton's penitence over his relationship with Monica S Lewinsky overshadows his trip to Russia, Ireland and Northern Ireland; Clinton remains popular overseas, but foreign leaders are aware that even without scan...", "word_count": 1084, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Trip Fails to Silence Doubt on His Domestic Clout", "print_headline": "Clinton Trip Fails to Silence Doubt on His Domestic Clout", "body_text": " **********It has been a question from the start of President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland and Northern Ireland this week: will his domestic troubles affect his ability to function abroad as the nation's leader? **********The answer, from the President's aides, has been a resounding and unanimous no. **********But others are not so certain, and a strong piece of evidence came from Moscow on Friday, when Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Acting Prime Minister, announced measures to try to pull Russia out of its economic tailspin. **********Less than a day after Mr. Clinton left Moscow, where he delivered a series of stern lectures on fiscal and monetary responsibility, Mr. Chernomyrdin proposed an ''economic dictatorship'' that would include a huge  infusion of new rubles to prop up failing banks, almost certainly a prescription for a burst of inflation and a step that Mr. Clinton specifically warned against. **********To be sure, Mr. Chernomyrdin is in a tough battle for confirmation and Russia's internal politics are little influenced by outside forces. But it was clear that Russia's leaders either were not listening to Mr. Clinton's lectures or they did not fear the effects of defying him. **********Other evidence came on the front pages of American newspapers all week, which were dominated by stories not of Mr. Clinton's diplomacy but of the slow progress of his penitence over his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. **********Mr. Clinton took questions twice from reporters, during a news conference on Wednesday with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and a Friday meeting with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland. **********Both appearances were overshadowed by questions about Ms. Lewinsky, and the coverage in the United States focused almost exclusively on the President's calibrated regrets over the affair. **********Scholars say it is impossible to separate a President's domestic fortunes from his prestige abroad. Although Mr. Clinton remains popular overseas -- particularly in Ireland, where he is given credit for supporting efforts that led to the Northern Ireland peace accord this year --  leaders recognize that even without the Lewinsky scandal, Mr. Clinton is a lame duck with a little more than two years remaining in his term, if he completes it. **********''It is difficult to be damaged goods at home and to be effective abroad,'' said Dmitri K. Simes, director of the Nixon Center research organization in Washington and a longtime foreign policy aide to Richard M. Nixon during his Presidency. **********Mr. Simes said that many Russians have written Mr. Clinton off, not only because he is crippled by domestic difficulties but also because Russians perceive him as being too close to Mr. Yeltsin, who is widely reviled by his countrymen. **********Mr. Clinton today lacks the moral authority to be ''a lasting partner for the Russians, particularly during the post-Yeltsin era,'' Mr. Simes said. **********Mr. Clinton's aides insisted that the President was not hampered in his ability to do his job by the low cloud of scandal hanging over him. **********Michael D. McCurry, the President's press secretary, said on Friday that Mr. Clinton operated in ''parallel universes'' -- battling scandal at home while conducting high policy abroad -- and declared that the two did not intersect. **********Asked whether Mr. Clinton's authority had been diminished by the Lewinsky matter, Mr. McCurry replied: ''It clearly has not been, and I think the President takes some satisfaction in that. He dealt with world leaders on this trip and is confident that he continues to do good work in the interest of the American people as he fulfills his constitutional responsibilities.'' **********In a less guarded moment, Mr. McCurry conceded that the Lewinsky matter had ''detracted'' from the main missions of the trip -- encouraging Russian leaders to stick to the course of economic reform and urging Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland to press ahead on the road to reconciliation. **********But Mr. McCurry and other aides blamed the press for an unhealthy obsession with the Lewinsky matter and for drowning out the President's message. ''It's all so circular,'' said one of Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy aides, his voice tinged with bitterness. ''You ask the questions and then you write that Clinton was forced once again to deal with Lewinsky. It hasn't come up in one meeting that we've had on this trip.'' **********But if the Lewinsky matter did not arise in meetings, neither did foreign leaders rally to the President's defense, at least not in public. Mr. McCurry assured reporters that Mr. Clinton had received many messages of encouragement from leaders around the world, but declined to identify any of them. **********Neither Mr. Yeltsin nor Mr. Ahern spoke on the President's behalf as he took questions about the scandal. Nor did Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, with whom Mr. Clinton spent the day in Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mr. Blair offered Mr. Clinton private solace and public support during a visit to Washington last January, shortly after the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was first disclosed. **********The trip has taken Mr. Clinton from meetings in a Moscow gripped by political and economic crisis to a meeting with families of the victims of the car bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland, to a festive rally in the streets of Limerick this morning. Mr. Clinton's mood has shifted as dramatically as the settings: somber in Moscow, mournful in Omagh, upbeat in Limerick. **********Mr. Clinton was hailed as a peacemaker in his appearances in Northern Ireland and Ireland the last three days, and he clearly reveled in the warmth of his reception here. **********Everywhere his message to the Irish was the same: though terror will surely return, the will to peace will overcome those who seek to destroy it. **********Looking out over a sea of waving American and Irish flags among the crowd packed into downtown Limerick this morning, Mr. Clinton said, ''As we mourn the losses in Omagh and the three little boys who were killed and taken from their parents' arms, remember there will still be efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to turn back, to get you to lose faith.'' **********''Don't do it,'' the President implored the enthusiastic throng of thousands. ''Don't do it. This is you at your best. Do not let them break your will.'' **********Mr. Clinton spent the afternoon pursuing the real reason he came to southwest Ireland today, playing golf at the historic course at Ballybunion. **********-------------------- **********Clinton Back in Washington **********WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 (AP) -- The President and his wife, Hillary, returned to Washington late tonight, landing aboard Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., at 11:10 P.M. after a flight from Shannon, Ireland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/12/business/tci-seeks-variety-in-software-and-suppliers-for-tv-boxes.html": {"writer_name": "John With", "pub_date": "1998-01-12", "snippet": "John C Malone, chairman of Tele-Communications Inc, has decided to use Sun Microsystems Inc's Java programming language rather than let Microsoft provide all the software for his interactive cable network; Malone seeks to create model that puts va...", "word_count": 1139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TCI Seeks Variety in Software And Suppliers for TV Boxes", "print_headline": "TCI Seeks Variety in Software And Suppliers for TV Boxes", "body_text": " **********John C. Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., believes he can succeed where his predecessors have failed. **********With two deals announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., this weekend, Mr. Malone has disclosed a plan that is intended to rein in the Microsoft Corporation's power and simultaneously fuel the dynamic economic growth that the cable television industry has been seeking so eagerly. **********By using Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language as a counterweight to a consumer version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, Mr. Malone is trying to relegate Microsoft to the same status as his other vendors. **********Rather than letting Microsoft provide all of the software for his interactive cable network, Mr. Malone is trying to create a model that puts the various components of the set-top box in the hands of numerous different vendors, much as if the box were a faucet and he were parceling out to different vendors the handle, washer, filter and pipes that affect the flow of the water. **********In this case, the water -- or programming -- is supposed to flow both ways, and needs a variety of software and hardware to do so. So Mr. Malone has created a ''layer cake'' business model in which each vendor provides only one piece of an integrated system that includes set-top box hardware, operating system software, the Java programming environment, software applications and a head-end server for distributing video and other digital content. **********But it is a risky gamble. **********Industry executives in Las Vegas this weekend said the cable industry infighting reminded them of the early days of the personal computer industry, where in 1981, I.B.M. initially offered PC buyers three competing operating systems: Microsoft's MS-DOS, the Digital Research Corporation's CP/M and UCSD Pascal. **********In the PC industry, however, consumers quickly settled on the low-cost alternative. Because Microsoft's operating system was the least expensive option, it became a standard, attracting the widest selection of software applications. **********Indeed, despite his efforts to create a more competitive marketplace, Mr. Malone may have repeated over the weekend the blunder made years ago by the International Business Machines Corporation. **********''Think of this as a poker table where most of the chips say Windows and William Gates is now holding them,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering Inc., an industry consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. In Mr. Malone's vision of the future interactive cable industry, the line between traditional television channels and personal computer software applications will rapidly be blurred. **********For example, while watching the History Channel, a television viewer  will eventually be able to use a handheld clicker to select a character on the screen and call up a box with additional information via the Internet. **********Because the new set-top boxes will actually be powerful computers, today's one-way channels will be complemented by the equivalent of personal computer programs that have been converted for the television screen, programs for bill paying, electronic mail or games. **********Mr. Malone sees this as nirvana for the ambitious cable television industry, which has consistently promised new services, like home banking, that it has proven unable to deliver. He wants his company to collect a portion of each electronic transaction made over the new interactive set-top boxes that Tele-Communications will begin offering to consumers in 1999. **********Tele-Communications is the nation's largest cable operator, with its boxes in 12 million of the nation's 65 million cable-equipped homes. The biggest, Time Warner Inc., is still in negotiations with a variety of potential suppliers for both software and hardware. **********Microsoft last year invested $1 billion in another cable company, the Comcast Corporation. Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast, said over the weekend, ''The industry has been searching for a new revenue stream for a number of years, and the prospect of this convergence is very promising.'' **********Mr. Malone, who is eager to avoid total dependence on Microsoft, is using Sun's Java as an additional layer of software to offer more choices to software developers and an alternative to Microsoft. **********The advantage of Java is that it permits software developers to write programs that can be run on many different types of computer hardware. That could be important if different and competing types of hardware are used in the set-top boxes distributed by the cable companies. **********A second advantage of Java is its security design, which is better than most personal computer environments today. The language was created by Sun engineers specifically to thwart rogue programs like computer viruses and worms, which threaten computer networks. **********Security is an important consideration if cable companies expect to gain the confidence of consumers they hope will do their banking, pay bills and shop via their television screens. **********But the more software applications are running, the more memory the set-top box will need, and more memory costs more money. **********On Saturday, Mr. Malone acknowledged that in order to run the Java alternative, it would be necessary to add memory chips to the set-top boxes. That, industry executives said, could end up consigning Sun to the same role as the losing personal computer operating systems in the early days of PC's. **********People familiar with the cable agreement signed by Sun and Tele-Communications on Friday said that in order to avoid that Sun's chairman, Scott G. McNealy, had agreed to pay Tele-Communications the additional costs to insure that there is room for the Java standards. **********Several company insiders said the payments could amount to as much as $10 to $12 a machine. Sun officials would not comment. **********At the same time, Mr. Malone also said Saturday that Tele-Communications was continuing discussions with Microsoft on a possible $1 billion investment to help build an interactive television network more quickly. **********One cable industry chief executive, who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous, said the industry badly needs new sources of revenue and that at a practical level, it might be worth ceding domination to Microsoft if that would help add new revenue sources. ''Cable has not had a big new product in years,'' he said. ''We need the catalyst of Silicon Valley to move ahead.'' **********At the same time, although the battle has now been joined, it is clearly not over. In addition to Microsoft and Sun, Oracle, Intel, I.B.M. and AT&T are all still jostling for a place at the table -- or inside the new digital set-top box. **********Moreover, while Mr. Gates proposed a new computer-oriented digital television standard called HD0 in his speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on Saturday, the nation's television broadcasters have yet to settle on a standard. **********And then of course there is the largest unanswered question: Do television viewers care about any of this? **********The computer industry is betting heavily that consumers will be willing to open their wallets for these new services. However, with many American homes already paying $25 or more a month for cable, there is little evidence yet that they will be willing to foot the bill for the much-hyped interactive television of the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/business/international-business-brazil-sells-most-of-state-phone-utility.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1998-07-30", "snippet": "Brazil sells control of most of its telephone system for about $19 billion; auction of 12 pieces of Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA, known as Telebras, is dominated by Telefonica of Spain, Portugal Telecom and MCI Communications Corp--partners in ...", "word_count": 858, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil Sells Most of State Phone Utility", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Brazil Sells Most of State Phone Utility", "body_text": " **********In the one of the largest privatization transactions ever, Brazil sold control of most of its telephone system yesterday for about $19 billion. **********The auction of the 12 pieces of Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras S.A., known as Telebras, was dominated by Telefonica of Spain, Portugal Telecom and the MCI Communications Corporation -- partners in a loose global alliance that spent a total of $11.6 billion. **********The sale was a success for the Brazilian Government, which raised 64 percent more than the minimum bids it advertised for the 12 companies of the broken-up Telebras. **********Coming amid the Asian economic and financial turbulence, when investors have been wary of emerging markets and economies like Brazil's, the auction's strong demand signaled confidence in the Brazilian economy, Government officials and Wall Street analysts said yesterday. **********For the big European and North American telecommunications companies that had winning bids, Brazil is a market with enormous growth potential. The world's fifth-largest nation, with 162 million people, Brazil has two-year waiting lists for telephones in some fast-growing areas. **********To be sure, multinational business customers are the most profitable segment of the telecommunications industry, and Brazil's prospects there are not as strong as those of some more advanced industrial and commercial nations. Indeed, companies like AT&T, which on Sunday announced a joint venture with British Telecommunications to serve multinational business customers, did not make bids. **********But the Brazilian market's sheer size and untapped profit opportunities were too potentially lucrative for companies like MCI, Portugal Telecom and Telefonica to ignore. **********Telefonica, which by dint of equity-stake purchases was already the largest phone provider for Latin America, bought the single richest license, spending $5 billion for control of the phone company that serves the Sao Paulo region. It also spent $1.2 billion for the wireless carrier that serves the regions of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. **********The success of Telefonica in yesterday's auction only serves to strengthen its alliance with MCI, which is to square off against the AT&T-British Telecom venture and the Global One consortium, which includes Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. **********For the auction, Telebras was split into three local phone companies, one long-distance carrier and eight wireless providers. While the Brazilian Government owned only about 20 percent of Telebras, it controlled 51 percent of the voting rights. **********The total sale was about 13 percent larger than the privatization of British Telecom for about $16.8 billion in the early 1990's, according to Securities Data of Newark. **********The auction of Telebras took about four hours on the trading floor of the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange. Near the exchange, police officers used tear gas, water cannon and batons against thousands of angry demonstrators, the Reuters news service reported. **********Opponents of the Brazilian Government contend that the privatization plan was a plot to deliver one of the nation's most valuable corporate assets into the hands of foreigners on the cheap. **********Brazil, which had been relatively slow in joining the global wave of privatization and deregulation, has now sold one of its last remaining state assets. The Government had already sold its stakes in Embraer, an aircraft manufacturer, and in steel, petrochemicals, railroads and much of the electricity industry. **********Among the large buyers yesterday were Telecom Italia S.p.A., which spent about $3 billion, and a Brazilian partnership of Andrade Gutierrez, a construction company, and Inepar, a communications and electric power equipment concern, which spent $2.9 billion. **********The Gutierrez-Inapar consortium spent $2.9 billion for control of the local phone company serving the Brazilian northeast, now the country's fastest-growing region. **********Telecom Italia spent $1.8 billion for the local phone company that serves the southern and central areas of Brazil, about $600 for the wireless company that serves the southern region and $570 million for the wireless company in the northeast. **********Telesystem of Canada spent about $650 million for the wireless company than serves the Minas Gerais region and $160 million for the wireless carrier for northern states. **********Portugal Telecom acquired the wireless company for the Sao Paulo region for $3.1 billion. Iberdrola, a Spanish electric power company, acquired the wireless carrier for the Bahia and Sergipe regions for $370 million. The wireless company for the central and southwestern parts of the country was acquired by Splice, a Brazilian high-technology concern, for $380 million. **********While yesterday's bidders could be concealing the identity of United States partners, MCI appeared to be the only such company to win licenses. It spent $2.3 billion for control of Embratel, Brazil's long-distance and international carrier. **********To acquire Embratel, MCI had to beat out Sprint, the No. 3 United States long-distance company.

And as the 25th anniversary approaches, it is clearly a memory that Egypt does not want a new generation to forget. **********A four-day ''silver jubilee'' that began today will feature a military parade, the first in 17 years. On Oct. 6, the anniversary of the day the war began, radio stations are to rebroadcast Communique No. 1, announcing that Egyptian troops had stormed across the Suez Canal. **********And to kick off the festivities, the Government staged a mass wedding  of 250 couples tonight in the shadow of the Great Pyramids, and broadcast it on television, in the clear determination that October might be remembered for years to come. **********The blend of war and romance has made for a passionate mix. **********''I am very proud that the happiest day of my life, which is my wedding, is the same day of the Israeli defeat, shame and sadness,'' said Iglal Adley, a 22-year-old law school graduate who was one of the brides taking part in the pageant. **********Less than a month ago Egypt allowed another anniversary to pass without notice, choosing not to commemorate the date 20 years ago when its acceptance of the Camp David accords made it the first in the Arab world to make peace with Israel. The slight was noticed in Israel, which has long bridled at the coldness of the peace. But in Egypt, the Camp David accords still evoke mixed feelings at best, and with little else in the recent past to cheer about, particularly on the Arab-Israeli front, the Government is trying to stir renewed pride on what is being remembered as a ''war for peace.'' **********''History is the memory of the nation,'' the Government newspaper Al Akhbar wrote in an editorial the other day, ''and the youth who did not live in the time of this great victory should know how Egypt defeated a foe that claimed it was unbeatable.'' **********In fact, the outcome was equivocal enough that Israel also calls it a victory, after it rebounded from the initial Arab attack, which came as Israel marked Yom Kippur. But no one disputes that the war was a turning point in the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********After the humiliations of 1948, 1956 and 1967, Egypt and its allies managed, for a short time, to regain the upper hand with a sudden thrust across the Suez that military historians have described as a masterpiece of planning and strategic surprise. **********In the first days of battle, Egypt on the south and Syria on the north advanced into Sinai and the Golan Heights, the territory that Israel had captured from them six years before. And while Israel regained control of those territories by the time of cease-fire, the war did prompt the first real consideration of the concept of land for peace. **********It was not until after Camp David that Egypt officially regained Sinai, but Egyptians have long been taught that it was what happened in October 1973 that restored the country's ''glory and self-confidence.'' **********In Egypt's recent history, only the 1952 revolt that toppled the monarchy and the 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal are remembered with nearly as much zeal. **********A satellite city outside Cairo and a bridge that spans the Nile both bear the name 6 October, while in the capital itself, the first three days of battle (but, conveniently, not the ones that followed) are re-enacted in miniature at the October panorama. **********But some of the glow has faded with time. It was at a parade in honor of the anniversary in 1981 that Islamic militants assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat, and in the years since, the country's main preoccupation has been with internal problems. **********And so officials planning the 25th-anniversary celebration said they wanted to reach out to those too young to remember the war itself. **********Along with the tradition of an annual parade, they seized on a wedding at the Pyramids, designed to include in particular those born in 1973 -- in order, as Hosni Ghazi, deputy director of the Youth Authority put it, ''to remind the young generation of their glorious past.'' **********Dazzled by their free wedding dresses, flowers and the lavish entertainment -- all laid on by the Youth Authority and business sponsors -- many couples said that without this help that might not otherwise have been able to marry. **********In rural villages, mass weddings have long been embraced, and the Government has seemed to encourage the idea, even staging a 1992 wedding of 200 couples at Cairo Stadium, until tonight the largest that anyone could remember. **********But the fervor tonight often seemed less personal than political. **********Oula Mahmoud Sultan, 25, the bride who cut the cake, pronounced herself proud to be having ''such a big wedding at a time when all of Egypt is celebrating such a big victory.'' Because her father was killed in the war, she and her new husband, Ahmed Abdel Mohsen, 28, were granted a one-month honeymoon in Germany, a particular luxury, they said, because they still cannot afford an apartment of their own. **********''I do not want Egypt to ever fight again,'' Ms. Sultan said before the ceremony.

It can be a lawless place filled with unscrupulous operators pushing get-rich-quick schemes and other scams. **********Naturally, those who study business ethics worry about the Web. ''Every possible abuse of integrity and decency takes place on the Web,'' said Laura Pincus Hartman, director of the Institute for Business and Professional Ethics at DePaul University in Chicago. **********Randy Pennington, an ethics consultant based in Dallas, said there was ''a sense that moral and ethical values are not important'' on the Web. But that does not surprise him. ''There is no standardization in technology on the Web, so why do we expect standardization in behavior?'' he said. **********Mr. Pennington said that to avoid an attempt at ''regulation of ethical behavior in the future, the on-line community must regulate itself.'' **********''This country has a history of regulating those industries that do not control themselves,'' he added. Despite the global nature of the Web, he sees the possibility of Government intervention. **********The Netcheck Commerce Bureau is one attempt at self-regulation. The agency, which has 700 corporate members in about 80 countries, maintains a list of companies involved in electronic commerce. Visitors to Netcheck's site can register consumer complaints about anything from unsolicited E-mail to copyright disputes. There is even a place to compliment a company. The site's philosophy is that ''public pressure is the only real deterrent in this new frontier.'' **********The Web is also a great place to learn about and research the issues of business ethics, both within the Internet and beyond. An excellent starting place is the site of the institute at DePaul that Ms. Hartman heads. The site provides an introduction to business ethics but goes well beyond that. It is home to the Online Journal of Ethics and has comprehensive links to other sites that deal with the topic. **********The business of domain names and how they are registered involves some of the worst breaches of ethics on the Internet. Corporations and nonprofit groups are being forced to spend a lot of time, money and energy to fight piracy of high-profile .com and .org addresses. Even in the world of business ethics, names can be less than clear. For example, Business-ethics.org is the home of the International Business Ethics Institute, and Businessethics.org belongs to the Council for Ethics in Economics. The institute, which has a truly global background, has a site that contains a sparse brochure. The council -- which is trying to ''strengthen the ethical fabric of business and economic life'' -- has a more substantial site with articles from the quarterly publication Ethics in Economics, and texts of speeches on ethics organized by the institute, based in Columbus, Ohio. **********The Ethics Resource Center is a leading nonprofit ethics consultancy. The site offers information about the  center's work with large corporations in developing ethics programs. **********The Center for Business Ethics, at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., is home to the Ethics Officer Association. This group represents the executives that help police many of the nation's large corporations. **********Few industries have been mired in as many questions about ethics, both real and perceived, as the military industry. One attempt to address its problems is the Defense Industry Initiative on Business Ethics and Conduct, a group of large military contractors, which has an in-depth site about the organization and aspects of Government contracting. Much of the information is applicable to other industries. **********Unlike many other sites, the Better Business Bureau site, which is run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, is aimed at consumers in addition to the corporate world. It provides tips on various consumer frauds. It also has a guide to ''establishing an ethical business'' and a detailed code of advertising that explains common abuses and misleading claims. **********Establishing an ethics code is an important step for any company or industry, and a growing number of sites carry such codes. The DePaul site has compiled a list of direct links to a variety of codes, including Johnson & Johnson, Northern Telecom and the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. Also included is the code of ethics of the International Ethical Business Registry, a Canadian organization that promotes ethics codes. Among the aims of the registry: donating at least 10 percent of its gross income ''toward the betterment of mankind.'' Its site has pointers about setting up a first-time code and answers a common question: ''Is a code of ethics like a mission statement?'' **********(Answer: ''No. A mission statement states what you do. A code of ethics states how you do it.'') **********At first glance, a site that promises ''business ethics from an Islamic perspective,'' as the Islamic Training Foundation does, seems to be far removed from most of what is available on the Web. But in a closer look at some of the material, readers learn that Allah describes successful people as those who are ''inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong.''

Across town, Bill Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said: ''You do what you can. You plan for contingencies.'' **********The two executives are hardly talking about a new deal with James Cameron -- the studios financed ''Titanic'' -- or a blockbuster gone awry. What's on the minds of Ms. Lansing and Mr. Mechanic is the possibility of a strike by actors that would not only damage the entertainment industry but also Southern California's economy. About 262,000 people work in the television and movie business in the Los Angeles area. **********Although the three-year contract between the producers and actors -- represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists -- does not expire until June 30, negotiations grew intense last week. Both sides bargained all weekend and reached a tentative agreement early yesterday morning. **********But the situation remains delicate and volatile. The agreement is subject to approval by a board representing both groups. And then the joint membership of 130,000 must vote on it, too. So must members of the management side, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. **********Richard Masur, head of the Screen Actors' Guild, said yesterday that he expected the membership to vote on the proposal in the next few weeks. ''I feel very secure that when we have a chance to present what's in the package that there won't be any disappointments,'' he said. **********The last actors' strike came in July 1980, stirring turmoil mostly with that year's fall television schedule until the actors returned to work three months later. But the most serious Hollywood strike in recent years took place in 1988, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike for 22 weeks. The walkout cost the industry and writers an estimated $500 million. (The writers, whose East and West Coast branches have engaged in a high-profile squabble in recent months, are now in negotiations on a new contract with producers and the networks. The deadline is  May 2, but, for the moment, studios seem to think that an actors' strike may be a more immediate threat than a writers' walkout.) **********At issue in the talks between the actors and management is the subject of foreign and cable television ''residuals'' -- the share of revenues that actors earn when their films are shown abroad or on cable. The unions insist that it is time for studios and companies to share the wealth they are reaping from such sales. They argue that the residual formulas -- set up in the 1980's, when the lucrative foreign marketplace was less developed and cable channels less numerous -- are outdated. **********Producers, on the other hand, insist that expenses have exploded: the average cost of making and marketing a movie has reached $75.6 million. Producers say that keeping costs down, and companies profitable, can create more jobs for actors. **********Under the tentative contract, both sides agreed to undertake a joint study to define the structure for a deal on the residual issues. The study is expected to be completed in two years. **********A strike would hardly affect the fortunes of Leonardo DiCaprio or Jerry Seinfeld. But 8 of 10 members of the Screen Actors Guild earn less than $10,000 a year from acting, and most hold down other part-time jobs to pay the rent. **********Mr. Masur of the Screen Actors Guild has said that a strike is just about the last thing his members want but that the union will call one if the members see no progress in their key demands. **********Film studios are reacting nervously to the threat of a strike. What especially concerns studios is the possibility of a strike in the midst of making a film. **********''We're taking precautions,'' Ms. Lansing said. ''We are not shooting any pictures that don't finish before a strike.'' Ms. Lansing said that she was hopeful, in fact, that films currently in production would be completed three weeks before the June 30 deadline. ''We want to have a three-week cushion,'' she said. **********Like many other studios, Fox is to start filming several new projects in July -- not May or June. So if a strike takes place, the studios would simply delay new productions. **********Mr. Mechanic, the Fox executive, said, ''Everything should either be wrapped or ready to start. We won't get caught in the middle.'' **********Mr. Mechanic said that the last thing the movie business needed was a strike. ''A strike is obviously bad -- and the only positive that could come out of it will be to perhaps slow down production,'' he said. ''Maybe all the studios will decide that less may be better and that the costs of movies are out of control. Maybe we'll get sane at the same time.'' **********Not every studio is alarmed about a potential strike. Dreamworks, for example, is moving ahead with film production that could be interrupted by a strike. And producers said that if a top star became available, other studios would take the risk, too. ''Believe me, if Tom Cruise said he wanted to start a movie before that deadline date, they'd start it,'' said Scott Rudin, one of Hollywood's most prolific producers. Mr. Rudin has three new movies about to start production -- a remake of ''Shaft,'' the adaptation of the book ''Angela's Ashes,'' and the film version of the television show ''South Park.''

For 20 years, German settlers moving inland had been stealing land and cattle, raping women, lynching men with impunity and calling them ''baboons'' to their faces. When the Herero attacked, they killed all the men, but on the orders of their leader, Samuel Maherero, spared women, children, missionaries and the few English and Afrikaner farmers. **********When word reached Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin, the counterattack was brutal and quickly expanded into slaughter, which some later saw as an ominous portent of the Holocaust. In a bizarre twist, many racist theories adopted by Hitler were being formed at roughly the same time here by a visiting geneticist. **********In this age in which national apologies are demanded, in which President Clinton expressed regret for slavery on a trip to Africa and German leaders have gone down on their knees to Jews and Poles for World War II, the Herero are asking for their turn. Germany seems to be wavering on the edge of apologizing and even paying reparations, but the politics of modern Namibia -- the former German colony of South-West Africa -- complicate matters. **********The historical facts are not disputed. Lieut. Gen. Lothar von Trotha, notorious for his butchery in German East Africa, was dispatched with 10,000 volunteers and a battle plan. **********Von Trotha pushed the Herero guerrillas and their families north to Waterberg and then attacked from three sides, leaving one exit: the Omaheke Desert. When the Herero fled into it, he poisoned the water holes, erected guard posts along a 150-mile line and bayoneted everyone who crawled out. **********He then issued the Vernichtungsbefehl, or extermination order:  ''Within the German borders, every Herero, whether armed or unarmed, with or without cattle, will be shot. I shall not accept any more women or children. I shall drive them back to their people -- otherwise I shall order shots to be fired at them.'' **********The remaining Herero were rounded up and sent to labor camps, where they starved or died of overwork, typhus and smallpox. **********By 1907 the order had been denounced and von Trotha had been recalled -- but the rebellion had been crushed. Before the war there were 80,000 Herero. In the 1911 census, 15,000 were found. **********Few people outside southern Africa or Germany have heard of the tribe unless they have read Thomas Pynchon's novel ''Gravity's Rainbow'' or seen travel books depicting their unusual clothes. **********In Mr. Pynchon's 1973 novel, a psychedelic take on World War II during the rain of German rockets on London, a fictional Herero battalion called the Schwarzkommando runs rocket batteries in the occupied Netherlands. Historians say they are a figment of Mr. Pynchon's imagination. The tiny numbers of black Germans, descendants of French African soldiers occupying the Rhineland after World War I, were sterilized by the Third Reich, not drafted. **********The unusual clothes are another issue. Alone in Africa, Herero women habitually wear hoop skirts. They adapted their high-waisted dresses and hats that jut out like cattle horns from the wives of Victorian-era missionaries. On holidays they wear versions of the dress in red and black, the colors of Herero nationalism -- and of the 19th-century German Empire. Their men wear the German volunteers' uniform. **********German diplomats are always invited to Herero celebrations. ''We are treated like V.I.P.'s and often asked to give the keynote speech,'' said one diplomat, who confessed that he is baffled by the practice. **********The peculiar attraction between the Herero and Germans here resembles the one in the Natal region of South Africa between the Zulus and British, two other peoples who fought a brutal colonial war. **********''It's the respect of a soldier for a soldier,'' explained Kuaima Riruako, paramount chief of the Herero. ''We never gave up our army, even during the German period.'' The chief is a leader in the quest for reparations. **********But the links are much closer. Because many Herero women were forced into sexual slavery to survive after the rebellion, many Herero today have German ancestors, and German is widely spoken here. **********Those relationships later helped underwrite Nazi pseudoscience used to justify the Holocaust. Eugen Fischer, a University of Freiburg geneticist, studied mixed-race children in the colony and concluded that each was physically and mentally inferior to his or her German parent. Hitler read his book, ''The Principles of Human Heredity and Race Hygiene,'' while in prison in 1923 and used its notions of subhuman races in ''Mein Kampf.'' Under Hitler, Fischer was named rector of the University of Berlin and in 1934 taught the first course for SS doctors. **********''This was the peak of scientific racism,'' said Frank Chalk, co-director of the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies **********Now the Herero are a minor tribe, greatly outnumbered by the northern Ovambo people, who were beyond German reach in colonial days but led the fight against white South African rule, which ended victoriously in 1990. The governing party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, is dominated by Ovambo and many Herero belong to the opposition, so the Government does not back their quest. Per capita, Namibia gets more German aid than any other country -- $350 million since 1990 -- but almost every pfennig is spent in Ovambo areas. **********Another Herero leader, Mburumba Kerina, says his people do not want cash but ''a mini-Marshall Plan'' to get businesses started, and scholarships to German universities. **********''Helmut Kohl came here in 1995,'' Mr. Kerina said, ''but he refused to see us.'' Mr. Kerina led protests. **********In March, President Roman Herzog of Germany visited and the issue was raised anew, with different results. Calling the massacre ''a dark chapter in our bilateral relations,'' Mr. Herzog declined to apologize, but came close in saying that the colonial authorities had ''acted incorrectly'' and that the killings were ''a burden on the conscience of every German.'' **********He said international laws requiring reparations were not in place in 1907, but he promised to take the Herero petition to Bonn. **********One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would not be surprised if some aid were forthcoming, although it would never formally be called ''reparations'' and paying one tribe might offend others. The Nama, for example, rebelled after the Herero did and lost 50 percent of their population. But they never faced a written extermination order. **********A further complication is the nervousness of the country's small but economically powerful white German-speaking population. **********''It wasn't our generation that did it,'' said Eberhard Hofmann, editor of Allgemeine Zeitung, a local paper. ''It's like the biblical quote -- the sins of the fathers being paid for by the children. If you asked all the Germans in Namibia today, I'd say the majority would not want reparations.'' **********Since any apology and money would come from modern Germany itself, the issue would seem to make no difference to Mr. Hofmann's subscribers. But their real fear is land rights. Half of Namibia's 1.7 million people are impoverished and living in crowded tribal areas, while German-speaking ranchers own millions of acres seized 90 years ago. **********''We want reparations to buy land and give it to people who need it,'' said Chief Riruako. ''We don't want to seize it the way they're doing in Zimbabwe. I don't want to destroy.'' **********Efforts to win apologies gain strength when abuses on one side of the world are mirrored on another. Mr. Kerina, who like many Herero has a German grandparent, is delighted that Japan apologized for having kept Korean women as army sex slaves during World War II. **********''I thought, hey, that's my grandmother -- a comfort woman,'' he said. ''And I thought, if the Japanese could pay for that, the Germans could.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/30/world/french-judge-in-war-crimes-case-said-to-be-related-to-a-victim.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1998-01-30", "snippet": "Trial of former French Vichy official Maurice Papon for complicity in German war crimes during occupation in World War II is mired in controversy about whether presiding judge, Jean-Lois Castagnede, should step down after unexpected assertion that...", "word_count": 397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Judge in War Crimes Case Said to Be Related to a Victim", "print_headline": "French Judge in War Crimes Case Said to Be Related to a Victim", "body_text": " **********The trial of a former French functionary for complicity in German war crimes during the occupation in World War II ended its 58th session early today, mired in controversy about whether the presiding judge should step down after an unexpected assertion that he was distantly related to one of the surviving victims. **********The judge, Jean-Louis Castagnede, who has conducted the trial of the former Vichy official, Maurice Papon, since it opened in Bordeaux on Oct. 8, gave no indication today that he would recuse himself, but suspended the trial until Monday without explanation. **********Marc Robert, a prosecutor in the case, said the judge had no idea that any relative of his had been a victim of the wartime roundups, arrests and deportation of Jews to Nazi death camps that Mr. Papon is accused of ordering when he was deputy head of the French civil administration in occupied southwest France. The judge, he said, had only the vaguest childhood recollection of the relative in question. **********Late Wednesday, the Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld and his son, Arno Klarsfeld, representing several families that became civil parties in the trial to bolster the case against Mr. Papon, said they had discovered that an uncle of the judge named Jean-Pierre Castagnede had married Esterina Benaim, a Jew who had managed to escape deportation from Bordeaux with her family in 1943. Her parents and two sisters died in Auschwitz. **********''To our knowledge, Presiding Judge Jean-Louis Castagnede has avoided mentioning this relationship,'' Arno Klarsfeld said on Wednesday, and his father said today that the judge should disqualify himself. **********''He can't stay on as presiding judge,'' Serge Klarsfeld told Le Monde. ''There would be doubts about the verdict, so it's up to him to draw the consequences.'' **********Other lawyers for the civil parties, and prosecutors, expressed consternation today and puzzled over the Klarsfelds' motives. The Klarsfelds had pressed Judge Castagnede to keep Mr. Papon in custody during the trial, as is usual in such criminal cases, but the judge ordered the 87-year-old defendant released on his own recognizance because of frail health shortly after the trial began. **********''I'd rather disrupt the trial now than have it be disrupted in a few months, right before the verdict,'' Arno Klarsfeld said.

It turns out, though, that Mrs. Sinnock may have made her greatest contribution to the Beardstown Ladies, as the famous stock-picking group became known, with an embarrassing accounting error more than a decade later. **********Remember that 23.4 percent annual return the ladies thought they had received on their investments from 1984 to 1993? It was heralded as trouncing the Wall Street pros in the club's 1995 best seller, ''The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide,'' and in four subsequent financial advice books. Well, the return would actually have been a modest 9.1 percent but for Mrs. Sinnock's mistaken data entries. The grandmothers from the rural Illinois town of 6,200 whom publicists called among ''the great investment minds of our generation'' would have been just another investment club falling unimpressively short of the 14.9 percent annual return for the Standard & Poor's 500 for that decade. **********The ladies might then have missed out on book royalties, exciting travel, television appearances, the thrill of turning their obscure hometown into a tourist stop -- and the fringe benefit of amusing marriage proposals. (Maxine Thomas, 77 years old, has 37 so far.) **********True, the club had achieved some prominence before Mrs. Sinnock's slip-up; it was spotlighted on ''CBS This Morning'' in 1991, for example. But the ladies became national celebrities with the ''Common-Sense Guide.'' The book, which spent nearly three months on The New York Times best-seller list, was subtitled, ''How We Beat the Stock Market -- And How You Can Too.'' **********Others would also have missed out if the group had not become so famous. The long bull market is the biggest factor in the growth of investment clubs, to more than 34,000 today from fewer than 13,000 in 1994, but the Beardstown Ladies are undoubtedly second, said Robert O'Hara, vice president of development for the National Association of Investors Corporation. Based in Madison Heights, Mich., the N.A.I.C., a clearinghouse for investment clubs, has long used the ladies as a stellar example of a club. **********Indeed, people love the ladies, who now number 14 and average more than 70 years of age, for their folksy manner and their message that average people can make money by researching stocks and investing steadily, and learn about the world and enjoy their friends at the same time. **********''A lot of our investors are saying that how well the ladies did is not the point,'' Mr. O'Hara said. ''The point is that the ladies invested all those years and have done well for themselves, as have those who followed their example.'' **********Moreover, thanks to improving performance since 1993, the annual return for the club's 14 full years has climbed to 15.3 percent, according to a Price Waterhouse audit. That compares with 17.2 percent for the S.& P. 500 in that period. **********Still, Hyperion, the publishing arm of the Walt Disney Company that has sold one million Beardstown books and just shipped 133,000 copies of the latest, ''The Beardstown Ladies' Pocketbook Guide to Picking Stocks,'' must be holding its breath. **********The trouble started last month when a Chicago magazine article delved into a disclaimer on the copyright page of a 1996 reprinting of the ''Common-Sense Guide.'' **********The disclaimer suggested that the ladies' track record might have been inflated by an incredible bookkeeping tactic: the dues put into buying stocks -- $25 from each member each month -- were not being subtracted in calculating the club's returns. The disclaimer had been inserted by Seth Godin Productions, a Irvington, N.Y., company that had assembled the books from interviews, its own research and papers from the ladies. **********Things got muddier when Mrs. Sinnock, 66, told The Wall Street Journal, also last month, that she did not think dues had been mixed with returns but was not sure. That is when Price Waterhouse was brought in to provide an independent audit of the club. **********That review led to the announcement last week that the disclaimer was mistaken. The returns were indeed inflated, the Beardstown Ladies acknowledged, but only because Mrs. Sinnock got befuddled by the N.A.I.C. computer program. Apparently,  none of the outsiders involved in assembling the materials for the books ''authored'' for the ladies by Seth Godin Productions had questioned the figures. **********''We are terribly sorry for the error,'' Mrs. Sinnock said. ''The ladies were very concerned that the public would think we had purposely misrepresented the results in any of our books.'' **********There seems little chance of that. Although some investment advisers say the Beardstown legend has contributed to dangerous overconfidence in the long-soaring stock market, it is hard to find investors who say  unkind words about the ladies. **********''I think they just made an honest mistake,'' said Frances Coe, vice president of Women Investing Now, a club in suburban Chicago. ''I really don't think they were doing it to sell books or anything like that.'' **********Nevertheless, the ladies may face exile to the heap of the ho-hum. ''You'd suspect sales won't be as strong going forward,'' said Marshall Loeb, the author of several financial advice books. **********Hyperion is expressing vague corporate confidence that demand will remain strong, promising to send out correction slips for books already out and to include correct data in ''all future printings.'' **********Seth Godin, president of the company that assembled the books, added that the Beardstown message is not about beating index funds but about coming out ahead of doing nothing at all. The ladies' next book, he said, will be a guide to estate planning. **********Judging from the warm reception for the four ladies who were featured speakers on March 14 at a fund-raiser in Oak Park, Ill., the Beardstown members will be out of the spotlight only if they leave on their own. **********The audience loved the cheerful shtick that accompanies their anyone-can-do-it message. ''From birth to 18, you need good parents,'' Mrs. Thomas advised. ''From 18 to 30, you need good looks and from 30 to 50 a good personality. But after 50, you'd better have some good investments.'' **********Elsie Scheer, one of three members in their 80's, told listeners she was ''looking after the hereafter'' -- as in ''I go upstairs, I go downstairs, I go to the basement and I ask, 'What am I here after?' '' **********And it is hard to go too wrong with the investing tactics they described here. ''We look at Value Line and we want to see 5 to 10 years of growth,'' said Carol McCombs, who is Mrs. Scheer's daughter. The ladies -- who have a $350,000 portfolio, far larger than the N.A.I.C. average of $90,000 -- also spread their risks among different sectors. **********No one at the fund-raiser asked about the inflated claims, although some conceded privately that they were curious. When asked what she would have said if the subject had come up, Mrs. McCombs answered: ''We're not worried about the numbers. We are just interested in getting people to save and invest.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/14/business/international-briefs-moody-s-cuts-ratings-on-the-daiwa-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-02-14", "snippet": "Moody's Investors Service cuts rating of Daiwa Bank Ltd; weighs downgrading Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd and Nippon Trust Bank Ltd, citing weak Japanese and Asian economies (S)", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moody's Cuts Ratings On the Daiwa Bank", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Moody's Cuts Ratings On the Daiwa Bank", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investors Service cut Daiwa Bank Ltd.'s long-term deposits to one notch above junk and gave the bank its lowest financial-strength rating yesterday, the latest downgrade to affect Japan's lenders. **********Moody's, which cited Daiwa's bad loans, also put on review for a possible cut the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the world's largest lender measured by assets.

Indeed, at one point Bloomberg executives were said to have debated shutting down the consultant's terminal, but were persuaded to keep it active by law enforcement officials in order to allow the investigation to continue. **********The Government is investigating whether the subsidiary, Reuters Analytics, commissioned Cyberspace Research to steal the information from Bloomberg. The investigation, which has been under way for about a year, is examining whether the data were incorporated into products of Reuters, and whether officials used it to reconstruct analysis programs used by Bloomberg through a process known as ''reverse engineering,'' Reuters said in a statement this week. **********Michael Bloomberg, the chairman and chief executive of the company, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Robert Crooke, a Reuters spokesman, also declined comment. Telephone calls to Cyberspace Research have gone unanswered for several days, and the line was disconnected yesterday.

Bloomberg established a lead in such data early on, although Reuters maintained its strength in pricing data fed from exchanges and information known as ''contributed data,'' which is provided by financial institutions reporting in such areas as foreign exchange. **********In the week since Reuters first disclosed the grand jury investigation, Cyberspace Research has rapidly emerged as the linchpin of the inquiry. Federal prosecutors were said to have obtained more than 100 written communications between Reuters Analytics, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and Cyberspace Research.

It suggests that Ms. Castanon, who was detained briefly in Switzerland, had made her statements to American investigators, but it does not state that directly. Nor does it specify whether the bribes that she acknowledged, according to the court papers, were kickbacks from companies that had business with the Mexican Government or payments by drug traffickers. **********Mr. Salinas has repeatedly denied having done anything illegal. He said last year that he had cashed in on ''huge opportunities'' that came his way as the President's brother. But in paraphrasing a United States request for Swiss legal assistance on Feb. 14, 1996, the Swiss document says the American prosecutors had argued that ''very important drug dealers'' had given Mr. Salinas part of his fortune ''to secure the undisturbed passage of drugs through Mexico to the U.S.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/30/business/company-news-jackpot-enterprises-in-stock-deal-for-crc-holdings.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-10-30", "snippet": "Jackpot Enterprises Inc signs letter of intent to buy the casino company CRC Holdings Inc for about $71.3 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JACKPOT ENTERPRISES IN STOCK DEAL FOR CRC HOLDINGS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; JACKPOT ENTERPRISES IN STOCK DEAL FOR CRC HOLDINGS", "body_text": " **********Jackpot Enterprises Inc., an operator of slot machines and casinos, signed a letter of intent yesterday to buy the closely held casino company CRC Holdings Inc. for about $71.3 million in stock.

It might instead be the one that is engulfing Japan's Finance Ministry. **********Two ministry officials were arrested last week on charges of taking payoffs -- mostly in the form of expensive meals -- and then doing favors for the banks that had fed them. A little titillation was supplied by the allegation that one of the bureaucrats had been entertained at a restaurant known for its scantily clad waitresses. The Minister of Finance and his top bureaucrat promptly resigned. Another bureaucrat killed himself, perhaps because of the investigation. **********As corruption goes, taking a free meal doesn't rank very high. But it looks as though those out to get the ministry have just started. By the end of the week, a Japanese newspaper was claiming that the ministry had suggested the scheme by which the now-bankrupt Yamaichi Securities had covered up huge trading losses. **********Viewed from across the sea, it appears that somebody in Japan's establishment has figured out that things must change economically, and so has decided to defang the Finance Ministry, hitherto the roadblock to reform. If that impression is correct, Japan may finally be ready to do what has long been needed -- stimulate its economy with a loose fiscal policy and use a lot of public money to clean up the sick banking system. **********If so, the last thing you want to own is stock in a Japanese bank that is about to be closed down. But what you should most want to own are shares in Japanese banks that are destined to survive. ''It is Citicorp at $10,'' says Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig & Company. **********Early in this decade, the American banking system looked as though it was going broke, and Citicorp shares fell to the single digits. Now they sell for well over $100. **********For years, Japan was in denial about its banks' problems. The Government's policy was to push interest rates down to almost zero and hope banks would use the cheap money to make enough profits to offset the bad loans whose existence was officially denied by both banks and ministers. The strategy did not work, as was clear even before bad loans to other Asian countries began mounting. **********On Jan. 12, the Topix index of 100 Japanese bank stocks was 73 percent below its level at the end of 1989 and 41 percent below where it was at the end of 1996. If it went much lower, that would imply the death of the financial system of the world's No. 2 economy. **********The next day, Japan's banks promised to come clean on bad loans by adopting international disclosure standards. That was one sign that the Japanese establishment realized action was needed. This week's scandal is another. **********Previously, there were false indications that Japan was going to act. But now the stakes are higher. With the rest of Asia in so much trouble, the need for action in Tokyo is clear. Without it, the implications for Japan, the rest of Asia and the world economy are bad, and there will be few good investments available anywhere. But if action is forthcoming, Japanese bank shares will soar, as American ones did after 1990. **********Japanese bank shares already have started to move. Since Jan. 12, the bank index is up 23 percent, much better than the overall Japanese market.  Among the better banks, Tokyo-Mitsubishi is up 10 percent; Sumitomo has gained 23 percent. **********If reform is coming, and the power of the Finance Ministry is really being broken, those moves are just the beginning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/world/debate-in-ireland-centers-on-provision-to-free-ira-prisoners.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1998-04-30", "snippet": "National debate is under way in Irish Republic over provision of new Northern Ireland peace agreement that would grant early release to Irish Republican Army prisoners convicted of terrorist acts, possibly including murder; agreement will be put t...", "word_count": 565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debate in Ireland Centers on Provision to Free I.R.A.

The agreement will be put to separate referendums here and in Northern Ireland on May 22. **********The debate began five days after the agreement was reached, when nine I.R.A. prisoners serving terms for terrorist offenses were released early by the Irish Government. The act was widely seen as a concession to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., both of which consider prisoners a major issue. **********There was an immediate outcry from politicians and the public that the agreement made it possible that murderers of Irish policemen would be released before serving mandatory 40-year terms. There are still about 40 I.R.A. prisoners, including several convicted murderers of policemen, in prison in Ireland. **********The focus of public anger, expressed by members of Parliament and in hundreds of calls to radio programs, is the case of Detective Sgt. Gerry McCabe. While escorting a cash deposit in an unmarked car, he was shot to death with a machine gun in June 1996 in the village of Adare, in western Ireland, by men later officially identified as I.R.A. guerrillas. They were arrested on murder charges in Limerick. No trial date has been set. **********On Monday the dead officer's brother-in-law, Pat Kearney, a member of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview on national radio that ''they should not be released for at least 40 years,'' adding, ''If I was in charge, I would favor execution.'' **********Mr. Kearney, a former policeman, said: ''The policemen put their life on the line to protect society. Society should protect the policemen. People tell me I am articulating what people are thinking, that the murder of Gerry McCabe had nothing to do with the political life of this country.'' **********Michael Kirby, the vice president of the Garda Representative Association, the police union, said the I.R.A. had murdered 13 Irish policemen since 1969, when the sectarian violence in the North began to grow. **********''We see these acts as criminal acts which could not be described as political,'' he said on Monday. **********The protest puts the Government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in a difficult position. Dublin wants to support all aspects of the new agreement, and does not want to antagonize Sinn Fein, hoping it will tell its supporters to vote for the new pact. Among other things, the agreement will give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in the affairs of the mostly Protestant British province. **********Mr. Ahern's Justice Minister, John O'Donoghue, said the men accused of killing the detective would not be released if they were convicted of murder. But many people, aware of the major concessions made to Sinn Fein to win its approval of the new agreement, fear that the Government may find a loophole for early release if the accused I.R.A. men are found guilty of murder. **********They point to the position of Sinn Fein, which has remained adamant that all I.R.A. prisoners, including those convicted of murder, be freed early under the agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-29", "snippet": "Japan's currency rises on news reports that Kiichi Miyazawa, well-regarded former Prime Minister, has been asked to become Finance Minister; dollar falls to 141.35 yen from 142.41 in New York trading; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********YEN GAINS.

The Bailey's Book House program is popular but doesn't accomplish anything that could not be better accomplished away from the screen. **********Bailey is a cat who hangs out in his play book house. Different areas of his house lead to different learning activities. The Three-Letter Carnival section, for example, has two different areas of activity. The first area shows a lawn with different characters and objects scattered around. Click on any object and the word for it is written out and sounded out slowly. Reading with your child can accomplish this goal better. **********The second level is better. The child must fill each car of a roller coaster with rhyming words. If the first car has a bug in it, the user could click on pictures of a rug, a jug and a mug to complete the train. Every word is spoken out loud when the child picks it. **********If the user clicks on the typewriter in Bailey's house, the Letter Machine pops up. If your child likes to use the computer, this is an effective tool for teaching the alphabet and letter sounds. Clicking on any letter brings up that letter and a phrase using it. The sound quality of the program is excellent, and it is easy to hear the emphasis on the letter sounds. But, again, the same goal could be accomplished with a good alphabet book. **********The Read-a-Rhyme section is a wonderful area for parents to work with their children. The screen shows a phrase with a missing last word. In the corner are four pictures of words that would complete the sentence with a rhyming sound. The phrase ''Rub-a-dub-dub, three kids in a . . .'' could end with tub, sub, shrub or club, depending on the user's choice, and the completed sentence is then read aloud and the sentence is shown as an animated picture. Children find this hilarious. **********The My Friend activity is something like a digital Mr. Potato Head.  This area should help cement the words for body parts, like eyes and nose, but the presentation is too confusing. On the screen are an animated creature and three columns, two with descriptive words and one listing body parts. Click on a word to change the character's appearance. **********I watched some kindergartners play with this program and they clicked furiously, paying no attention to the actual words. Some of the level's elements are effective for teaching the children to identify body parts but not for recognizing actual written vocabulary. **********The program is designed for 2- to 5-year-old children and consequently does not require any reading skills. That is important, as many programs that cater to this age group fail to recognize that even the simple words ''click the mouse'' on the screen mean nothing to a child who cannot read. **********Children may learn some basic vocabulary from Bailey's Book House, but the program is too simple.

Munkbat, a trader running a small shop in the Mongolian capital that sells soap, soft drinks and other household goods, including some from China. \"China is so big that I am sure they want to try to take over Mongolia again.\" **********To China's south, recent treaties with Burma have ended years of bloody fighting and resulted in thriving trade and casino businesses along the border. But a distaste for the new trade is emphasized by merchants who complain about an onslaught of low-priced, inferior-quality goods and an often-repeated story that Burma's dogs and cats were being exported to China for food. **********In Vietnam, a traditional enemy of China, Hanoi has frequently griped that China is undermining the country's economy with an invasion of cheap exports. **********In Mongolia's case, suspicion of China is deep and historic. The 19th century domination by Beijing that ended with the integration of Nei Monggol, or Inner Mongolia, into China remains a more bitter memory than the recently ended 70 years of Soviet-backed dictatorship. **********Wary of Mongolian sensibilities, Chinese business executives tend to keep a low profile, but Beijing has been actively courting the government. Since 1991, China's president, prime minister, speaker of Parliament, foreign minister and the son of the late leader Deng Xiaoping have all visited Mongolia. **********The concrete result of this increased interaction is a treaty that completely opens the border between China and Mongolia for at least 30 days a year. **********Beijing's friendship offensive comes as cash-strapped Moscow is unable to keep up a Soviet-era level of influence in Ulaan Baatar. Diplomats describe the shift of influence in Mongolia from Moscow to Beijing as the eastern fringe of the modern struggle for power in Central Asia. **********A decade ago, almost no trade and investment came to Mongolia from China. Since opening up in 1991, Mongolia's trade with China has grown to $250 million in 1997. Mongolia's exports to China rose 24 percent in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year. **********By some estimates, China now buys nearly half of everything Mongolia exports, including copper sent for accounting reasons through Switzerland. **********As foreign investors, the Chinese, with 260 joint ventures in production of clothes and milk and in the construction industry, now outnumber all other nationalities. **********The strongest effect of Chinese businesses is being felt in the cashmere and textiles industries. Mongolian cashmere factory owners complain that the more pro-active Chinese traders buy up the raw goats fur and refine it in China at lower cost. **********\"I just cannot compete with them on their tight margins,\" a cashmere processor said at a recent investors conference in Ulaan Baatar. **********Government officials also allege that Chinese traders are taking advantage of low tariffs accorded Mongolia through its membership in the World Trade Organization. Although no new factories have been built in Mongolia, the country's textile exports more than doubled in the first quarter of this year to 10 billion tugricks ($12.2 million) from 4.8 billion tugriks for the same period last year. **********\"Trade can be good, but we must be careful with China and be certain that rules are established,\" an adviser to Mongolia's prime minister said. **********Along the Chinese border in Burma's Shan State, local merchants and former rulers of the northern states also fear the consequences of open trade with their gigantic neighbor. **********\"We're the next Tibet,\" a prominent hereditary ruler of Shan province told a visitor, describing the flood of traders and lengthy convoys of Chinese trucks carrying away Burma's tropical forest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/28/business/investing-it-a-bigger-league-is-playing-to-the-players.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Sweeney", "pub_date": "1998-06-28", "snippet": "Increasing number of banks, brokerage firms, money managers and mutual fund companies are wooing high-paid professional athletes; athletes and advisers face challenge of planning for lifetime of assets after brief playing period; photos (M)", "word_count": 1087, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Bigger League Is Playing to the Players", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT; A Bigger League Is Playing to the Players", "body_text": " **********WALL STREET'S competitive culture has always been populated by more than a few sports fans. But now the institutions themselves -- banks, brokerage firms, money managers and mutual fund companies -- are developing a love of the game. Or, more exactly, a love of the players and their substantial paychecks. **********In a period when skyrocketing salaries and signing bonuses, multiyear contracts and lucrative endorsements can push annual incomes well into the millions, professional athletes as a group have become highly desirable and actively courted clients. **********A few institutions have gone as far as setting up separate departments just to serve athletes. For example, the Star Banc Corporation in Cincinnati opened such a division three years ago and put two former college football players and current vice presidents, Jonathan Hayes and Earl Layne, in charge of managing money for some 80 professional athletes. State Street Research and Management, the country's second-oldest mutual fund manager, which has guarded the fortunes of generations of patrician Bostonians, inaugurated its Athletes fund last autumn and hired a retired Bruins hockey star, Derek Sanderson, as resident rainmaker. Others, like Merrill Lynch & Company, have tried to make their sales forces more athlete-savvy. **********These companies are charging onto a field once used only by a handful of boutique money managers, like CSI Management in San Francisco or Investment Advisors International in Cleveland. (I.A.I. is a division of the International Management Group, which got its start representing golfers and tennis players in the 1960's.) **********''We are seeing a lot more competition, especially from traditional Wall Street houses and even Big Six accounting firms,'' said Leland H. Faust, president of CSI. **********Until recently, most professional athletes were considered anything but the carriage trade. Just ask John Havlicek, the legendary Boston Celtic and 13-time National Basketball Association all-star. Mr. Havlicek earned only $15,000 as a rookie in 1962, equivalent to about $80,500 today, and even worked in the off-season as a representative for a hardware and home-appliance company. He and a couple of other Celtics tried to pool their money and buy a few hundred dollars' worth of stock, but had trouble finding a broker who would take them on as clients, Mr. Havlicek recalled. **********According to Mr. Faust, ''When the top salary in major league baseball was $700,000, it wasn't chump change, but there were still a lot of higher-paid people around.'' Now, when the median salary in major-league baseball is $1.3 million, he said, ''you have a bigger market.'' **********Athletes now ''qualify as bona fide clients,'' Mr. Faust added. **********As a rule, however, athletes are very different from other clients in their income bracket, like corporate executives, doctors or lawyers. They are typically much younger and suddenly wealthy -- often signing fat bonus contracts in their teens -- and have spent their lives learning to excel in their sport, not in finance. Many are from small-town or working-class backgrounds, and few have had much exposure to money management. They have too often been prey to dubious advice from flamboyant agents or hangers-on. **********As a result, institutional money management for professional athletes has become a specialty that combines private banking and trust-department functions with the roles of coach, psychologist and even guardian. **********Advisers find themselves steering clients clear of risky ventures like nightclubs and restaurants, car-wash franchises and oil-and-gas partnerships that are often pitched to athletes and other celebrities. ''Every day I see guys lose money on bad investments,'' said Victor Green, a defensive back for the New York Jets who recently signed a three-year contract for a total of $3 million and keeps his money with Star Bank, a unit of Star Banc. **********ATHLETES and their advisers also face the challenge of planning for a lifetime around a peak earnings period that can be agonizingly brief. **********John L. Macklin, president of I.A.I., which has $1 billion in assets under management and counts Mr. Havlicek and the retired tennis champion Martina Navratilova among the firm's clients, says he invests an athlete's money as if it were the portfolio of a 58-year-old executive just a few years shy of retirement. **********Such an outlook calls for a fairly conservative strategy. Star Bank's portfolio managers typically suggest a mixture of about 60 percent large-cap equities, 30 percent bonds and the remainder in money market funds. Specific stocks that Star Bank recommends to athletes include Walt Disney; Sofamor Danek, a medical-supply company, and Clear Channel Communications, which operates a large chain of radio stations. **********At State Street Research, F. Gardner Jackson Jr., a portfolio manager, says the firm's new Athletes fund, which requires a minimum initial investment of $500,000, is mainly invested in large-cap growth stocks, and performs like a State Street institutional mutual fund that had a 47.4 percent total return for the 12 months ended April 30, a bit better than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during the period. The fund holds stakes in 55 companies including General Electric, DuPont and two hot drug companies, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer. **********Advisers often find themselves helping their athlete clients with day-to-day money matters. Surrounded by temptations to spend heavily on luxury clothes and cars, multiple homes and late nights on the town, professional athletes sometimes need reminding that succumbing would mean robbing their own future, the advisers say. **********Kenneth W. Ready of the Denver office of Prudential Securities, who has about 50 football players as clients, said one player called him from Las Vegas to ask for more money after he had lost $4,000 gambling. ''I told him no,'' Mr. Ready said, ''and he got mad. But when he got back to Denver, he gave me a big hug.'' **********At Star Bank, Mr. Layne, who played football at Liberty University while earning a degree in finance, has attracted many players as clients with similarly personalized service. He and Mr. Hayes, who founded the bank's pro sports division, routinely take care of extracurricular tasks like seeing that clients' bills are paid and that their insurance policies are renewed on time. **********Not all clients, of course, need or want such help. And advisers say it is often hard to persuade naturally aggressive athletes to play it safe with their money. ''I tell the guys that they are already on third base and don't need to hit a home run,'' Mr. Layne said. ''All they need to do is hit singles and doubles, and that will get them home.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/05/business/patents-overhaul-rules-possible-but-opposition-plan-remains-fierce.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1998-01-05", "snippet": "Congress is moving toward most sweeping overhaul of nation's patents law in 45 years, but it is unclear whether legislation will receive final approval this year (M)", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; An overhaul of the rules is possible, but opposition to the plan remains fierce.", "print_headline": "Patents; An overhaul of the rules is possible, but opposition to the plan remains fierce.", "body_text": " **********CONGRESS is once again moving toward the most sweeping overhaul of the nation's patents law in 45 years, but it is unclear whether the legislation will receive final approval this year. **********The patents bill has been held up for several years, in part because of heavy opposition from some inventors. Last year it was passed by the House and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would make four key changes: ***********It would broaden the rights of third parties to initiate a full-fledged re-examination by the Patent and Trademark Office of patents that have already issued. ''Currently, in most circumstances you have to go to court,'' said Jay R. Thomas, an associate professor of law at George Washington University. ''This would turn Patent Office officials into judges and is similar to what other countries do. The question is, can the U.S. Patent Office handle this responsibility?'' ***********It would require the publication of patent applications after 18 months; now they are kept secret until the patent is issued. ''The idea is that you enrich the bank of technology information, no matter what the fate of an individual patent,'' Professor Thomas said. An amendment tacked on in the House would exempt independent inventors and universities from this provision, thereby creating ''a lot of loopholes,'' he said. ***********It would give greater rights to those who, instead of seeking a patent, protect their technology as a trade secret. Under current law, those who keep their ideas trade secrets are considered infringers once a patent on similar technology is issued to someone else; the infringer must either stop using it or pay royalties to the patent holder. ''Right now, winner takes all,'' Professor Thomas said. ''This would spread the wealth by allowing trade-secret users to keep using the technology without penalty.'' ***********It would recast the Patent Office as a semiprivate corporation much like the United States Postal Service, on the theory that it would be run more efficiently. **********The legislation has faced spirited opposition from many independent inventors, whose symbolic leader was Jerome Lemelson, an inventor who had been granted about 500 patents and successfully challenged several companies with infringement suits. Mr. Lemelson died last fall, but inventor groups say that his absence will not diminish the opposition to the patent bill. **********Alexander Fraser, president of the Inventors Network of the Capital Area, said the most troublesome aspect of the legislation was the part that would make the office a semi-private corporation, with a board of directors from the private sector. **********Mr. Fraser posed this hypothetical situation: ''Imagine that you are a patent examiner and I come along with my new transistor that will cut Sony's profits by 50 percent. Sony has a member on the board controlling the corporation. Is the examiner going to give me my patent?'' **********Bruce A. Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, who initiated much of the patent legislation, called such fears ''absolutely ridiculous.'' **********''In fact it's quite the opposite,'' he said. ''Politics would be taken out of the Patent Office, to the extent that it is here.'' **********Important Rulings Awaited on Appeals **********Two important decisions are expected this year from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the highest patent court in the nation: ***********In re Zurko. This case turns on a narrow technical issue that has much broader implications about how much deference should be made to previous Patent Office rulings when the appeals court decides to hear a case. ***********State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group regarding a patent for a financial management technique. This long-awaited ruling should help establish what types of business practices can be patented. ''A lot of patents are issuing that people are starting to get embarrassed about,'' said Professor Thomas, who cited as examples a recent patent covering a way to swing a golf club and another that covers a method of remodeling a home. ''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''the delay in the ruling doesn't bode well'' for a decisive opinion. **********Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/31/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-three-marketers-name-agencies-for-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-08-31", "snippet": "Motley Fool names Martin Agency as first advertising agency to handle its account; Miller Brewing Co names UNO Communications to handle advertising aimed at Spanish consumers for Miller Lite beer brand; account had been handled by Lucero/Bentz; Ad...", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Three Marketers Name Agencies for Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Three Marketers Name Agencies for Accounts", "body_text": " **********Three marketers have announced their choices of agencies to handle their accounts. **********The Motley Fool in Alexandria, Va., a personal finance and investment site on the Internet, selected the Martin Agency in Richmond, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the first agency to handle its account.

Their target is one of the Sylaj men. **********The threat is real. Since the early 1990's, revenge killings have spread among the clans here, where the precepts of Lek Dukagjin, a 15th-century chieftain, prize honor and freedom above honesty, and where vengeance is the ruling passion. **********Weapons -- pistols in the old days, automatic assault rifles now -- are valued as much as human life: a man who kills another man and takes his weapon too can be avenged with the taking of two lives. **********''Who knows how many people have been killed through revenge?''  said Man Mulosmani, 64, a clan leader who is preaching reconciliation rather than retribution. ''Countless, countless. People don't want to report killings to the police because then the accused would be protected by the state in prison instead of being available to kill.'' **********This closed corner of Europe was described by British spies who trekked here on mule and foot during World War II as the wildest physical -- and psychological -- terrain on the continent. It is still reached by a precipitous dirt road hacked out of the mountains and a jade-tinted lake that swerves through vertical limestone cliffs and stony land. **********For nearly 50 years, the world's most isolated Communist system superficially submerged the customs that decree an eye for an eye and keep women in the lowliest position. But as Enver Hoxha's Communism evaporated at the beginning of this decade, so did the temporary covering it provided for ingrained ways of living. **********When the Albanian police force and army disintegrated during civil strife last year and the arms depots stashed with assault rifles and mortars sprang open, revenge killings skyrocketed. With households heavily armed and escaped prisoners in possession of armories of weapons, the Tropoje region became off-limits for outsiders, even for Government officials from the capital, Tirana. The fact that the sparsely settled area is the stronghold of the former President, Sali Berisha, adds to the inability of the new Socialist Government to impose order. **********In some places, like the village of Dragobi, the instability of the past and the present are easy to see. The Ismaeli family's house, for example, has narrow slits in the limestone walls. They are ideal for aiming a gun at the outside world while providing protection against anyone who might want to attack, family members explained. In their living room, a hole in the wall covered by a sliding door once served as a hiding place for their grandfather's pistol. Now this is where the women keep their embroidery. Instead of a pistol, the family now keep assault rifles. **********As hard as Mr. Mulosmani, a retired agronomist with a shock of white hair, tries to mediate between feuding families, it is a difficult task. He spent a session cross-legged on the Sylajs' living room floor -- a manner borrowed from the Turks who dominated Albania until 1912 -- discussing ways to avert more bloodshed. He came away with no resolution. **********Intended to regulate medieval life, the Canon of Lek, as it is known, has been perverted by people to suit their own needs, Mr. Mulosmani said. Now, the lawless society floats between the ages-old customs and a state unable to adapt to modernity in the wake of Communism. **********For example, Fatmir Haklaj, 27, recently resigned as police chief of Tropojo to avenge a family murder and is reported by his former colleagues to have killed, or ordered the killing, of eight men so far for the murder of his brother. His brother was sprayed with nine bullets in January. **********The leader of one of the most powerful clans, Mr. Haklaj vowed that he would kill one man for every bullet pumped into his brother's body, his colleagues said. According to Mr. Haklaj's arithmetic, he has one killing to go. **********Last week the opposing Hoxe clan, which is accused of killing Mr. Haklaj's brother, were in mourning after burying a relative who they believe was the latest victim of Mr. Haklaj's revenge. The police have stood by, pleading powerlessness. **********The unchecked violence in the Tropoje district is combined with extreme poverty. **********The Communist-era hospital has been looted so often that robberies have subsided because there is nothing left to steal. International aid agencies are too frightened to come to help. **********Many families make do with one chicken a week made into broth and served with a plank of hard cornbread. There is no industry and only families who have men abroad -- often as illegal immigrants in Greece or Italy -- can make ends meet. Those families sometimes flaunt their flimsy foreign contact with pictures of Western starlets pinned to their walls. **********Such families usually spend the first remittances from abroad on a television set. But those wealthier families remain self-sufficient, living off the land, even down to the limestone rocks that are fashioned into bricks in outdoor kilns. **********The Ismaelis in Dragobi are one such family. Another is the family of Hatixhe Selimi, 42, a teacher in Valbone, a tiny settlement near the border with Kosovo. **********By necessity, Mrs. Selimi is a prudent homemaker. For her 12-year-old daughter, Aurela, and her 7-year-old niece, Viola, she uses milk from her cow, makes feta-style cheese and bakes bread from water and corn in a wood-burning oven. For guests, she serves potatoes and cabbage from her garden. She and her daughter dress in Western castoffs sold at outdoor markets and keep warm in socks hand-knitted from the wool of their sheep. **********When Lek conceived his canon in the mid-15th century, women were held in such low esteem that they were exempt from most feuds and were regarded as chattel to do a man's bidding. Today, women still back out of a door so as not to show disrespect to the men in the room. **********Under the Communists, Mrs. Selimi was allowed to choose her own husband. But such freedom was unusual even then and is getting rarer now. The old rules of arranged marriages are back in vogue, she said. **********Asked how the Canon of Lek affected women now, Mrs. Selimi rolled her eyes, held her breath and looked around her living room, where several male visitors were gathered. **********''Well, I suppose I'll tell you,'' she replied tentatively. **********Last year, she recounted, there was a marriage ceremony in Valbone. As usual, the wedding feast was strung out over several days. Suddenly the festivities stopped. **********The groom had discovered that his bride was not a virgin. He dispatched her back to her parents. **********Later, unable to bear the shame -- the worst kind of affliction in these stubborn highlands -- the young woman slipped away down the mountains to the anonymity of the lowlands."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/18/business/company-news-trizechahn-buys-office-properties-after-selling-malls.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-12-18", "snippet": "TrizecHahn Corp completes sale of its US shopping mall holdings for $2.5 billion and reinvests $1.5 billion of proceeds in office properties; TrizecHahn agreed to sell 20 malls in April to Westfield America Inc and to Rouse Co; among office proper...", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRIZECHAHN BUYS OFFICE PROPERTIES AFTER SELLING MALLS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; TRIZECHAHN BUYS OFFICE PROPERTIES AFTER SELLING MALLS", "body_text": " **********The TrizecHahn Corporation of Toronto said yesterday that it had completed the sale of its United States shopping mall holdings for $2.5 billion and had reinvested $1.5 billion of the proceeds in office properties.

Dismissed? To Sue or Not to Sue", "print_headline": "EARNING IT; Laid Off? Dismissed? To Sue or Not to Sue", "body_text": " **********AS if getting laid off wasn't bad enough, a growing number of workers have an extra-tough decision to make on their way out the door: whether to forever give up their right to sue the boss. Those who do can walk away with a sweet deal. Those who don't gamble that they'll be better off in the long run. **********Consider the case of Paul C. Bevan, a former marketing director for Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis, who was replaced by a younger man and  laid off in 1992. At the time, Honeywell offered Mr. Bevan $273,000 if he would release the company from any legal claims. Mr. Bevan, who was 52 and had been with the company for 24 years, refused to sign the release. Honeywell then reduced the severance package to about $60,000, he said. **********Soon after the layoff, Mr. Bevan sued Honeywell, contending age discrimination. His five-year battle ended last summer when the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a jury verdict in his favor. The award, including interest and legal fees, was more than $900,000, he said. Honeywell declined to comment beyond a statement saying it had a ''corporate-wide policy'' against discrimination. **********In asking for a release, or waiver, companies want to rule out trouble down the line -- discrimination cases based on race, sex or age. A waiver is ''almost standard operating procedure whenever severance is given out,'' said Janice Goodman, an employment lawyer in Manhattan. **********Courts have said these waivers are legal as long as they are given voluntarily for ''adequate'' consideration. That usually means anything more than an employee would otherwise be entitled to, Ms. Goodman said. If the company does not normally give severance pay, which is not required by law, a worker may need to sign the release to get anything at all. **********In deciding whether a waiver is valid, the issue is not how much the company will pay but ''the circumstances under which the waiver was obtained,'' Ms. Goodman said. Economic coercion -- withholding severance unless the waiver is signed -- is not illegal, she said, though how far a company can go has yet to be tested. **********The key Federal law on waivers is the 1990 Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, which covers people older than 40. It says companies must give workers at least 21 days to decide whether to sign waivers and 45 days if a group of people is being terminated at one time. The waiver must let workers know that they are giving up the right to sue for age discrimination and must say that they have at least seven days after signing to change their minds. **********When a release is part of a voluntary buyout or a program offered to a group of employees, the company must give more information, including selection criteria for the program and the ''class, unit, or group of individuals covered''; the job titles and ages of the people selected, and the ages of people ''in the same job classification or organizational unit'' who are not eligible. **********Until recently, it was not clear whether workers who sign invalid waivers must return the severance money if they sue. Last month, the Supreme Court said they did not. **********That case involved Dolores Oubre, a former scheduler at a nuclear power plant in Killona, La., run by a unit of the Entergy Corporation. After she received a poor performance review, Entergy offered her a choice in early 1995 of trying to improve or resigning and receiving $6,258 in severance pay. Entergy gave her 14 days to make the decision -- a week less than the law requires. Ms. Oubre, then 41, signed the waiver. **********When she sued later, contending age discrimination, the company tried to get the case thrown out. Even if the waiver was invalid, it argued, the contract was binding because Ms. Oubre kept the money. **********Two lower courts ruled in Entergy's favor, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision on Jan. 26. Ms. Oubre must still prove that she was dismissed because of her age. **********While employment lawyers hailed the case as a victory for workers, they called the circumstances unusual. ''Don't sign a release with the idea that you're going to be able to disavow it later,'' advised Wayne N. Outten, a New York lawyer who has helped negotiate thousands of severance agreements. A better course, he said, is to ask for as much time as you need to decide and to talk to a lawyer before giving up any rights. **********Before pursuing legal action, of course, a key question is whether you have a good case. No matter how badly employees feel they have been treated, they do not have a claim unless it fits into some legal framework like discrimination, wrongful termination or violation of a law protecting whistle-blowers, said Gary Laturno, a San Diego employment lawyer. Even then, they should not count on hitting the jackpot. **********Typically, workers just get back pay -- the salary and benefits they would have earned from the time of dismissal until a court decides the case. If an employee finds another job while pursuing the case, the award is cut by whatever the person has earned at the new job. **********HARDER to predict is the effect on an employee's psyche, finances and career should the worker turn down the waiver and proceed with a lawsuit. **********Six years after he was dismissed, Mr. Bevan is negotiating an agreement to license his own invention -- a device to create an undulating practice-putting surface for golfers. But he had a tough time finding new employment while his case against Honeywell was pending. **********Ultimately, a former colleague helped him land a position in Boston as a branch manager for a company that makes fire alarm and building security systems. He resigned in January to spend more time marketing his invention. **********Mr. Bevan said he did not regret suing, but ''there's no calculation you could run that would show the return on investment was worthwhile.'' **********Lawyers typically advise clients to try negotiating a better severance package before contemplating legal action. Those with the most bargaining power are high-level, long-term employees with a good case, said Nancy Erika Smith, an employment lawyer in West Orange, N.J. Often the company is willing to improve on its initial offer, she said. **********One former vice president at a Midwestern advertising agency negotiated six months' salary and health benefits, instead of the three months of pay that was first offered. Other items that can ease a transition cost a company little, such as outplacement help, favorable references and the right to keep the company car or personal computer or to buy them for a nominal sum. **********A lawyer need not handle the negotiations. One marketing executive laid off from a large consumer products company never let on that she had a lawyer coaching her behind the scenes. As the lawyer counseled, she met with a personnel representative, rather than accepting a telephone brush-off. Though she had been with the company less than a year, she persuaded it to pay three-and-a-half months' severance -- a month more than the company had offered. **********Even after paying the lawyer, she figured she was $4,000 ahead. And, she said, she learned an important lesson. ''Always attempt to negotiate before you accept the first thing they hand you,'' she said. ''You have nothing to lose.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/15/business/company-news-wsmp-to-buy-pierre-foods-from-tyson-for-122-million.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-04-15", "snippet": "WSMP Inc agrees to acquire Pierre Foods sandwich and precooked meats business from Tyson Foods Inc for $122 million (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WSMP TO BUY PIERRE FOODS FROM TYSON FOR $122 MILLION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; WSMP TO BUY PIERRE FOODS FROM TYSON FOR $122 MILLION", "body_text": " **********WSMP Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Pierre Foods sandwich and precooked meats business from Tyson Foods Inc. for $122 million.

It is designed to ratchet up the political and military pressure, while providing him various opportunities to change his mind. **********First, the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, will try to win Mr. Milosevic's compliance during a last-ditch mission to Belgrade beginning on Friday. **********If Mr. Holbrooke fails or if his mission is protracted, NATO countries will vote within days to increase his leverage by giving the last required permission to the NATO Supreme Commander, the Gen. Wesley K. Clark, to begin air strikes against Serb positions and troops. **********That go-ahead -- known as an activation order -- requires the unanimous vote of all 16 NATO members. Afterwards, General Clark could proceed on his own timetable. But first NATO intends to make a significant display of its preparations -- the forward deployment of attack aircraft, for instance. **********The military plan has already been agreed upon: a series of phased attacks, intensifying at each step, with pauses built in to allow Mr. Milosevic and his military commanders to back down. **********The last phase -- an intensive attack on military installations anywhere in Serbia -- may require another NATO political vote first, the officials say. The same pattern held true when NATO bombed Mr. Milosevic to the bargaining table in 1995, over Bosnia, and NATO never did have to go to the final stage of its attack. **********If Mr. Milosevic ''simply intends to defy'' the international community, NATO's goal will be ''to destroy his capacity to inflict violent repression on the Kosovars,'' Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said. **********Mr. Milosevic's main backing is in the security forces and special police, not in the regular Yugoslav military, which is not likely to want to have its expensive air-control and command systems blasted by NATO. **********NATO aims not to destroy Mr. Milosevic but to persuade him to comply. The point, a senior NATO official said, is to negotiate and to get aid to refugees. ''NATO has no intention of going to war against Serbia or on behalf of an independent Kosovo,'' the official said. **********Mr. Milosevic, the Administration official said, has pulled out of Kosovo only about 60 percent of the troops and special police that NATO is insisting leave. Mr. Milosevic must withdraw the forces sent into Kosovo since February and keep in barracks the forces normally stationed in Kosovo, the officials said. **********Before February, there were 12,500 troops in Kosovo and about 6,500 special police, American officials said. There are now about 18,000 troops and 11,000 special police, the officials said, and while some of the troops are in barracks, none of the special police are. **********If Mr. Milosevic complies, NATO wants clear procedures to monitor his continued compliance, so that his troops do not pour back in to Kosovo. To do that, the West will need more than the 50 or so diplomatic observers currently in Kosovo. **********Some NATO countries feel strongly that a number of NATO ground troops must be used, in addition to troops from other organizations, for adequate monitoring. American officials, reluctant to put American ground troops into Kosovo, oppose the use of NATO troops, though the use of NATO aircraft and intelligence-gathering is foreseen. **********It is only in the last few days that Mr. Milosevic has begun to take seriously NATO's threat to use force, the Administration official said. **********The NATO official was blunter: ''Milosevic doesn't doubt NATO's capacity to carry out these attacks, but he does doubt our will. We have to convince him. The question becomes whether you just have to shout more loudly, or actually hit him before he gets the point.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/28/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-red-cross-picks-kaplan-thaler.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-08-28", "snippet": "American Red Cross in Washington names Kaplan Thaler Group to handle creative assignment for long-term brand image advertising campaign; campaign will include ads paid for by corporate sponsors as well as public service announcements (S)", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Red Cross Picks Kaplan Thaler", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Red Cross Picks Kaplan Thaler", "body_text": " **********The American Red Cross in Washington has named Kaplan Thaler Group in New York to handle the creative assignment for a long-term brand image advertising campaign. **********The campaign is to run three years and include ads paid for by corporate sponsors as well as public service announcements; the goal is to obtain $45 million worth of paid and donated commercial time and ad space a year.

He also paid tribute to the ''dignity'' of the victims' families, who have been waging a vigorous campaign with leaders of the Catholic community for a new inquiry and who, he said, wanted ''not to accuse individuals or institutions or invite fresh recriminations, but to establish the truth.'' **********Mr. Blair's decision represented another of the ''confidence-building moves'' his Government has been adopting to accompany political progress in five-month-old peace talks that are aimed at settling the conflict by May. **********These steps have included the early release of prisoners, the transfer of inmates from jails in England to jails in Ireland and the granting of holiday leaves to imprisoned guerrillas. **********Producing a credible account of what happened on Bloody Sunday was, he said, ''a way forward to the necessary reconciliation which will be such an important part of building a secure future for the people of Northern Ireland.'' **********The families' goal has been to clear the names of the victims, and they gained the active support of the Irish Government, which seven months ago sent Mr. Blair a dossier of new evidence. Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister, sought to force Mr. Blair's hand by saying he would publish the new information before Friday's anniversary. **********The 178-page document was issued in Dublin shortly after Mr. Blair made his announcement. It accused Lord Widgery, the Lord Chief Justice of England, who conducted the 1972 inquiry, of ''tainting the victims with responsibility for their own deaths'' in order to clear the conduct of the elite paratroopers. **********The closest a British Government has ever come to a review was a letter in 1992 from Prime Minister John Major to John Hume, the head of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which runs the government in Londonderry. **********Mr. Major wrote, ''Those who were killed should be regarded as innocent of any allegation they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.'' **********The expression was considered evasive by many Catholics because it left unchallenged the ''strong suspicion'' put forth in the Widgery report that the marchers might have been handling weapons or bombs earlier. **********The Widgery report, which was issued less than three months after the killings, cited the ''strong suspicion'' that the marchers were armed, accepted soldiers' claims of having been under attack, and argued that ''there is no reason to suppose that the soldiers would have opened fire if they had not been fired upon.'' **********Among the items of evidence cited by campaigners for a new inquiry were minutes of a Downing Street meeting the day after the shootings between Prime Minister Edward Heath and Lord Widgery, where Mr. Heath reminded the Justice that ''we were in Northern Ireland fighting not only a military war but a propaganda war.'' **********Mr. Heath, a wintry figure in the Commons these days, rose today from the front-row bench he customarily occupies to defend his decision to produce a quick report at the time. ''The general feeling was that the matter should be dealt with speedily,'' he said. **********The dead were among thousands of marchers who took to the main street of the Catholic working-class Bogside neighborhood on Jan. 30, 1972, to protest the British policy of internment without trial. They were met by British paratroopers newly arrived in the city and better versed in combat than crowd control. **********The gunfire sent the protesters scurrying in panic into stairwells and through alleys of the grey stone housing projects. A monument with the names of the victims and a whitewashed wall with the words ''You Are Entering Free Derry'' now mark the spot in the still dreary neighborhood where the dead fell. **********New ballistic and forensic evidence suggests that at least three victims were not killed by the advancing paratroopers, but were picked off as they tried to flee by military snipers above on the massive 17th-century walls that ring Londonderry. **********Paddy Ashdown, head of the Liberal Democratic Party and a Royal Marine Commander in Ulster in the immediate aftermath of the killings, said today, ''There is a general view at the time that there was a failure of professionalism on the night of Bloody Sunday, and I think there was a general view afterwards that the Widgery inquiry didn't get to the bottom of this.'' He said he thought the proposed new examination was ''wise, right and proper.'' **********The Conservative Party leader, William Hague, said he was glad Mr. Blair had called for an inquiry rather than offering an apology, as others had counseled him to do. **********''It would have been bizarre for you to make an apology in advance of any inquiry,'' he said. ''When it comes to discussing apologies, it would be both right and helpful to our hopes for peace to have an apology or see some sign of contrition from terrorist murders on both sides of the sectarian divide.'' **********Mr. Blair said he deplored all the killings in Northern Ireland, but argued that Bloody Sunday presented his Government with a special responsibility because the state was directly involved in the shooting and in the investigation. **********The only disapproving voice in the Commons was that of David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, the largest Protestant party in Northern Ireland. To cries of ''Shame! Shame!'' from other members, he accused Mr. Blair of using ''namby-pamby'' language and said, ''Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/14/business/company-news-stone-rivet-agrees-to-acquire-envirotest-systems.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-08-14", "snippet": "Stone Rivet Inc acquires Envirotest Systems Corp for $266.3 million; will assume debt of $275 million (S)", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STONE RIVET AGREES TO ACQUIRE ENVIROTEST SYSTEMS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; STONE RIVET AGREES TO ACQUIRE ENVIROTEST SYSTEMS", "body_text": " **********Stone Rivet Inc. agreed yesterday to acquire the Envirotest Systems Corporation, a provider of vehicle-inspection systems, for $17.25 a share, or $266.3 million.

Will Bring Back Days of Glory", "body_text": " **********Forget all those quarterbacks surrounded by 300-pound charging linemen: When the National Football League season starts this Sunday, the real pressure will be on the executives who call the plays at CBS. And they don't get to wear helmets. **********The contract that CBS signed in January to bring the N.F.L. back after a four-year absence from the network is surely the most scrutinized deal in recent television history: an eight-year, $4 billion commitment for a package of American Football Conference games. At $500 million a year, the deal is more than a 100 percent increase over the $217 million a year that NBC had been paying for the same package. **********CBS executives have characterized the deal as a strategic coup that they hope will be the linchpin to a resurgence in profits for television's once-dominant network, which has recently posted annual losses of $50 million to $100 million. **********At the same time, critics of CBS -- mainly executives at NBC, now out of  N.F.L. television -- call the deal financially irresponsible and predict CBS will begin losing $100 million to $150 million a year on football alone. **********The football broadcasts come at a critical time for the network and for Mel Karmazin, the president who owns 1.1 percent of CBS's stock and who was the driving force behind the deal. Only last Thursday, CBS announced a reorganization that included cost-cutting measures calculated to save $180 million. Among the moves announced were layoffs of 200 to 300 employees. **********Cost-cutting measures have been announced at both NBC and ABC this summer; but given the questions surrounding the size of the football deal, the moves at CBS were seen in some quarters as preparations for Hurricane Pigskin. **********CBS executives forcefully denied the cost-cutting was related to the football deal, just as they have forcefully asserted, in the face of contentions that they overpaid for N.F.L. games out of desperation, that their contract is sound and that the deal will, in the words of Mr. Karmazin, ''make a dollar'' for CBS. **********One week before the first slate of Sunday afternoon games, Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports, is not backing away from that rosy analysis of the deal. ''We're right on target,'' he said. **********The numbers that give him confidence, Mr. McManus said, come from increased advertising sales at both the network and CBS-owned stations, revenue generated from an exchange of commercial time with CBS affiliates, reduced costs for advertising in other media to promote CBS shows and anticipated benefits to CBS's prime-time lineup. **********The latter was among the biggest reasons CBS thought it had to reacquire the N.F.L. Without it, the network had almost no programming that attracted young male viewers. ''Over the last few years, young men had really left us,'' said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television. ''At the least, football will get some of that blood flowing.'' **********Among those still skeptical about CBS's positive numbers is Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, who said, ''CBS is practicing a form of mathematics with which none of my professors was familiar -- because they didn't have enough beads in their abacus.'' **********NBC is the network most familiar with CBS's football package because it owned it for 33 years. That relationship ended in January when NBC declined to match CBS's bid. Mr. Ebersol said NBC did not think the package could be worth more than $300 million a year. **********Tom Wolzien, a neutral observer as a media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that NBC had a special incentive for disparaging the CBS deal: ''NBC said no way would they spend that much, so they're trying to prove the rightness of their vision. Still this is a tough go for CBS. I'm projecting they'll lose $50 million on football this year.'' **********That would be significant because CBS's payments to the N.F.L. will rise over the length of the contract. The network is actually paying the least amount this season, an estimated $350 million. The later payments will be especially huge, but CBS is counting on advertising revenue to increase over time. **********Mr. McManus said, ''The true value to CBS is not going to be felt for four or five years.'' **********Nevertheless, he said, there is reason to be optimistic about this season. CBS is getting better prices for commercial time during the A.F.C. games than NBC did, he said. Advertising industry publications have estimated that CBS is getting about a 10 percent increase, a figure NBC questions. Mr. McManus declined to comment on the figure, but CBS's private estimates are that it will do even better than that, an executive close to CBS said. **********One reason CBS may be doing better with ad sales, Mr. McManus said, is that the A.F.C. teams are finally perceived to be fully competitive with those in the N.F.C., whose games are broadcast by Fox. **********CBS estimated that NBC sold ads in its package for about 15 percent less than Fox did, a disparity that CBS regarded as unfair. But Mr. Ebersol pointed out that advertisers prefer to be in games that reach the country's 10 biggest cities. The N.F.C. has eight teams in those cities; the A.F.C. has three. **********What might help CBS in selling the games is simply that they are new to it. When NBC pried the National Basketball Association games away from CBS starting in 1990 for $600 million, the bid was labeled dangerously high. But NBC, which extended the deal in 1993 for $750 million and again last year for $1.75 billion through 2002, found aggressive new ways to sell the games and made a huge profit. CBS says it is doing the same thing with football this year. **********Mr. McManus pointed to $45 million in new business that CBS has attracted from Nasdaq, Southwest Airlines and other companies. But Mr. Ebersol said that $25 million to $30 million in new business was typical every year. **********Mr. McManus said he was also counting on about $40 million in a deal the network made with affiliates to exchange commercial time in other parts of the CBS schedule. Then there is about $25 million that CBS is counting on saving from money it has been spending in other media to promote its programs, which it now thinks it can do during games. **********Some competing network executives question whether CBS can really count on the $40 million in cash from its complicated deal with its affiliates. And the questions about CBS come from more quarters than just NBC. ABC and Fox were no more happy that CBS started off the N.F.L. negotiations with its pre-emptive bid for the A.F.C. In effect, the N.F.L. used CBS's urgency to set the price for every package. **********One senior executive from a competing N.F.L. network said CBS's approach was amateurish. ''They didn't have to go in that high,'' the executive said. **********But CBS was fighting for nothing less than survival, at least in terms of perception. ''The perception when CBS lost football was that it was a second-class network,'' Mr. Moonves said. **********Always encumbered by being the network with the oldest audience -- in a business where advertisers pay premiums to reach younger adults -- CBS has been disastrously deficient in reaching younger men. Just adding the young men from NBC's A.F.C. audience last year would improve CBS's reach among men by 60 percent to 90 percent, CBS says its research estimates. **********Mr. McManus said CBS carefully calculated the value of the N.F.L. before it made its huge bid. Crucial was the benefit to the stations CBS owns, seven of which are in cities with A.F.C. teams. Those stations are adding many tie-in programs to the football games -- coaches' shows for example. If the stations gain in local market share, that will help justify the price, Mr. McManus said. **********Similarly, if CBS gains younger male viewers for its prime-time shows, the football deal will help pay for itself. David F. Poltrack, the executive vice president of CBS Research said, ''As little as a 10 percent increase in male viewers, spread around prime time, could generate a substantial profit increase.'' **********If that success came because CBS had a breakout hit show, the increase in advertising revenue could make up a large bit of the football price all by itself, though CBS has not had a hit with young male viewers in years. CBS is hoping that by promoting its shows during the football games, viewers will at least start to sample CBS shows. **********But the promotional value of sports has always been one of television's biggest imponderables. CBS had the Winter Olympics last year, yet no show the network promoted during that event developed into a hit. And Sunday football presents some special problems for CBS's program promotions. **********First, there are questions about the duration of any promotion's effect. Can one really be used to promote, say, CBS's new martial arts show, ''Martial Law,'' on Saturday nights, six days after the last tackle is made on Sunday? **********Promotions during Sunday football are most effective for shows on Sunday nights. CBS already has its best night on Sunday. Its top show, ''60 Minutes,'' is almost certain to be helped by direct lead-ins from football. But how many football fans can be delivered to ''Touched By an Angel'' and CBS's Sunday movie, which mainly appeal to women? **********CBS does have some Monday shows with male stars, including ''Cosby,'' ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and the new ''Benben'' show. But all those shows will run against ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC, which presumably would be a stronger draw to fans who watch football on Sunday. **********Mr. Poltrack questioned that, citing statistics that showed that only 30 percent of the younger men watching the A.F.C. on Sunday tuned in to ''Monday Night Football.'' **********He also noted that while promotional effect diminishes as days pass, viewers could be at least made aware of shows. Thus, if a younger man sees a promotion for ''Martial Law'' on Sunday and happens to be scanning channels the next Saturday, he might find the show and remember he had seen the commercial for it. **********Whatever happens in terms of the profit and loss this season, CBS executives say they think they did the right thing to get back into business with the N.F.L. because network television is becoming more and more dependent on one-of-a-kind event programming. They pointed to the deal Fox signed with the N.F.L. four years ago, which was then ridiculed as recklessly overpriced at $395 million a year. But, even though Fox eventually took a $350 million write-off on losses related to football, the N.F.L. deal by every other assessment was a huge success, helping to put Fox on the map as a network. **********Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television, said in a speech in June that NBC's decision to pass on the N.F.L. deal ''will go down as one of the defining moments of recent network history,'' one, he said, that NBC is likely to regret. **********With the N.B.A., the Olympics and other sports events still in their grip, NBC executives are convinced their network can survive easily without football.

How does Ruth Dreifuss serve as the emblematic representative of a country that for years tried, in effect, not to know how much it was a conscious onlooker to the Holocaust or even more, its shameful beneficiary? **********Her job is largely ceremonial, a mission she defines as more one of a \"facilitator\" than an uncontested leader at the head of the Federal Council, or Swiss government. Her election as president, she stresses, came not as part of a vast Swiss image-retouch, but because it was simply her turn, as the council member responsible for health and social affairs since 1993, to take over the country's rotating presidency. Even so, being President Dreifuss is not less delicate; getting to the consensual middle on the issue of Switzerland's conscience cannot be comfortable for her. **********When she talks to visitors in an office of careful unpretentiousness, her sentences almost always seem to come in pairs. It is as if her articulation of her dilemma, expressing the many contradictory levels of her vision of Switzerland, had a double track, a constant negative plus positive link, an on-the-one-hand layer of resolve and directness, and an on-the-other-hand layer of modifiers and clauses. **********So, when Miss Dreifuss points to how Switzerland started to resolve the issue of money owed Holocaust survivors by Swiss banks, she quickly adds, \"This was an initiative, I recognize, that was born only under outside pressure.\" **********The pattern is strong. On-the-one-hand: \"I don't want that my presidency gives anybody the feeling that Switzerland no longer has to be concerned with its past\" or the elements of anti-Semitism in it. Then, on-the-other, about anti-Semitism: \"I deny that it's any greater here than elsewhere. Don't have me saying that. But that's enough. Even if it's like it is elsewhere, that's enough.\" **********Yes, she says, there are now \"certain marks on Switzerland's reputation,\" but no, \"I don't think you can talk about damage\" to Swiss effectiveness economically or on the international level. **********- **********THE PATTERN seems almost instinctive, and curiously it reflects the way Miss Dreifuss sees Switzerland dealing with its fears about its past: \"There have always been two movements. We try to find out a bit more, and then we close up the cellar so as not to see what's in there. I think we're going much further now.\" **********Possibly the most intense period of Miss Dreifuss's presidency will come in the spring when a government-appointed panel of international historians will issue a report on Swiss policy during the war. She has said she expects to launch a national debate, and \u2014 the hunt for the middle comes in here \u2014 to explain to Jewish organizations where their demands are justified and where, as she signaled in advance, they are less so. **********Miss Dreifuss, who is 58 and not married, was born to Swiss-Jewish parents in St. Gallen and moved during the war to Geneva, across the lake from Nazi-occupied France, or as she puts it, \"a few kilometers from a death sentence.\" She recalls her father as a Swiss patriot, experiencing \"a moment of joy\" when he put on a Swiss military uniform for the first time. **********There was no massive, popular Swiss anti-Semitism during the war, Miss Dreifuss believes, but real anti-Semitism nonetheless in the country's asylum policy. \"The worst was the indifference, and pushed to the extreme, considering Nazism normal and that it didn't concern us.\" **********Her own career developed through the Socialist Party and feminist activities as she worked in the trade union movement. A reputation of calm, fairness, and competence allowed her to leap local politics, bringing her directly into the government five years ago. **********- **********MISS DREIFUSS talks sparingly of her own personal history, but she says her family \"lived in fear\" during the war. There has been no change in the volume of her mail since the Parliament approved her selection as president in early December, although some letters were \"more vehement, more stupid.\" As for anti-Semitism in Switzerland, \"I've encountered it, you could say. It happens. I've never suffered from it as an obstacle.\" **********In a country in which women received the right to vote in all its cantons only in 1990, Miss Dreifuss sees herself as a new face. \"I represent another Switzerland. More urban. More egalitarian. More tolerant.\" **********She is an advocate of Swiss membership in the United Nations and the European Union. Neither will happen on her watch, but should be taking place, she believes, during the next five years. **********If she insists she is unwilling to serve as anyone's lever or alibi, Miss Dreifuss says she will pay special attention to the needs of women's and human rights groups. Then she adds her modulating clause. They must not be demagogic. **********At her most bold, Miss Dreifuss, says, \"I'm happy to be able to say that Switzerland is moving and that I'm part of what's moving.\" **********This, of course, had its own careful preface: \"I don't want the Swiss to think that equality is achieved because I'm president of this country.\" **********\"There's a long way to go,\" she says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-got-milk-gets-hot-wheels-truck.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-03-18", "snippet": "Hot Wheels line of miniature vehicles, best known for souped-up sports cars, is adding something different to its lineup: dairy delivery truck named for popular 'Got milk?' campaign by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners unit of Omnicom Group (S)", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'Got Milk?'

He is facing impeachment proceedings by the provincial legislature, brought after he admitted under pressure last week that he had failed to declare the Swiss account on his tax returns. **********Ricardo Quintela, a Congressman from the governing Peronist Party, said that the ''time is right to jail officers who have escaped responsibility for their crimes.'' He called for Argentine prosecutors to model their cases after the United States Government's successful prosecution of the organized crime boss Al Capone for income-tax evasion. **********''Though the mere fact of holding an account in Switzerland does not  constitute a crime, it's clear that it raises suspicions that call for an  investigation into the possible criminal origins of the funds,'' said Emilio  Martinez Garbino, also a Peronist Congressman. **********Based on the testimony of survivors and relatives of victims, human rights groups estimate that the armed forces stole $70 million in assets -- including cash, cars, real estate and jewelry -- from those detained. At least 9,000 people were killed or disappeared, and tens of thousands more were tortured, a Government inquiry concluded. Human rights groups put the death toll at 30,000. **********It was common practice during the dictatorship for the military to loot the homes of people detained on suspicion of subversion, confiscate their autos and real estate and then resell them, and to extort money from businessmen and from family members of those detained. **********The Swiss accounts were discovered by a Swiss State Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, who is assisting a Spanish court investigation into the disappearance of 600 Spaniards in Argentina during the dictatorship. **********Argentine prosecutors said the Spanish court had revealed the identities of Mr. Bussi and the three other men. One, former Sgt. Carlos Vega, worked at a torture camp in Cordoba province where 3,000 detainees disappeared, Government documents  show. Another, former Lieut. Alfredo Astiz, was recently forced out of the military because of his actions during the dictatorship and is wanted in France for the killing of two French nuns in Argentina during the dictatorship. The third, Col. Roberto Roualdes, who died in 1995, had been  a leading figure in a military strike against leftists in Cordoba. **********The Argentine prosecutors said the Swiss had not revealed exactly how much money the four bank accounts contain, but the Argentine prosecutors said they believed that the total was at least $3 million. The prosecutors said they expected more information to emerge about other accounts belonging to members of the Argentine military. **********Legal experts said they believed that prosecutors could build a strong case against the three surviving men if it can be proved that they failed to  declare the bank accounts as personal assets or failed to pay taxes on the interest. Moreover, they could also be prosecuted for illicit enrichment. **********Until now, the Argentine Government has refused to cooperate with the Spanish inquiry, contending that Spain has no jurisdiction and that the amnesty laws prevent the Government from taking the men to court. By releasing the names of the holders of the Swiss accounts to Argentine prosecutors, Spanish investigators have taken the case directly to the Argentine public. **********The effort by some prosecutors and politicians in Argentina to use the Swiss bank accounts to prosecute the men is part of a crusade under way in several Latin countries to find  ways to punish the military for past crimes despite amnesty laws. **********Mr. Bussi, the provincial Governor who is facing impeachment, declared his innocence last week and said the money in the Swiss account -- $100,000, according to local newspapers -- had not come from plundering political prisoners. **********Mr. Bussi, who was implicated in many political crimes, including participation in illegal firing squads, said his failure to declare the account on his taxes was an ''error of omission,'' and he apologized. **********But human rights defenders said they believed that money came from the former military Government's widespread theft from thousands of people who died or disappeared during the anti-leftist crackdown."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/business/international-business-shift-seen-in-london-to-use-of-euro-sooner.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1998-11-04", "snippet": "British Government is signaling new warmth toward soon-to-be introduced European single currency, promising to divulge 'national change-over plan' for euro earlier than many people previously thought; Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has c...", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shift Seen in London to Use of Euro Sooner", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Shift Seen in London to Use of Euro Sooner", "body_text": " **********With subtle shifts of tone and emphasis, the British Government is signaling new warmth toward the soon-to-be introduced European single currency, promising to divulge a ''national change-over plan'' for the euro earlier than many people had previously thought. **********British pundits detected the shift from ministerial statements on Monday, replacing the word ''if'' with a more decisive ''when'' in references to the conditions for euro membership by Britain -- by far the biggest economic and political heavyweight of the four European Union nations outside the current euro club of 11 nations that will participate in using the new currency on Jan 1. **********Economists and political analysts said the shift could mark the beginnings of a campaign to prepare Britain's deeply divided public for a less contentious approach to the new currency. In recent years, the British economy has outpaced those of Continental Europe, provoking the argument among critics of monetary union that Britain has more to lose than gain from joining in the euro. **********But ''with the economic outlook worsening for cyclical reasons, this splendid isolation is no longer looking so splendid,'' said Holger Schmieding, senior economist with Merrill Lynch, and adding, ''That should mean that British public opinion should become a bit more euro-friendly.'' **********Indeed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, reduced the Government's forecast today for 1999 growth to a range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent from about 2.5 percent. **********At issue is what Mr. Brown on Monday called a ''national change-over plan'' to be published in January setting out the practical steps for Britain to join the euro at a later date. Previously, the Government had insisted that no decision be made before a referendum after the next national election, which will most likely be in mid-2002. **********While Mr. Brown did not modify that timetable, he said the Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted to prepare for joining in euro participation before the proposed referendum. **********''This Government has decisively and unambiguously put this country on a new road of constructive engagement with Europe,'' he told British business leaders at a meeting in Birmingham. ''We will set out the stage-by-stage procedures that will need to be followed. We will spell out the practical implications of changing to the euro, and we will give new advice to companies on the way to take forward their preparations.'' **********Peter Mandelson, the Trade and Industry Secretary, said: ''It would be economic lunacy for the sake of Euro-skeptic ideology to marginalize Britain on the sidelines of what should be its own market. We have made clear that we will join the single currency when it is in Britain's economic interests to do so.'' **********The remarks had little effect on the market, with the pound already well down from highs earlier this year against the German mark, the key European currency. The pound was quoted today at 2.75 marks, compared with 3.10 marks at its strongest level several months ago. Part of the pound's strength was ascribed by dealers to its role as a potential hedge against the euro. **********But the issue remains deeply divisive, with the opposition Conservatives demanding a much longer delay before a referendum, while the bulk of British business is in favor of joining in the new currency. Even on the current schedule, Britain will be outside the euro zone not only in January, when it goes into use in electronic business -- including huge euro-denominated stock, bond and derivatives markets -- but also when euro notes and coins enter circulation in January 2002. **********And some economists expressed puzzlement today at reports that Mr. Brown was considering a 40-month gap between announcing a referendum and introducing euro notes and coins -- a schedule that could delay full British membership until 2005, later than many financial institutions here had expected. **********''I think the way we look at it is that the Government has decided that it's the right thing to do and it's just a question of time after a referendum,'' said David Mackie, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company. ''But I'm a bit puzzled. The Government gives the impression that it's a done deal, but they also give the impression that a pretty long timetable is needed.'' **********The issue has touched off heated debate. For instance, The Sun tabloid, a staunch and powerful opponent of the euro, characterized Mr. Brown and Mr. Mandelson as ''euro fanatics'' in an article today -- echoing assertions by Tories that the Labor Government was seeking to stampede Britons into supporting the single currency without proper debate. **********By contrast, many business leaders at the Birmingham meeting urged the Government to go further and set a date for joining, complaining that official vagueness made it hard to plan for the euro's introduction. **********''We believe our members very much support joining the single currency, but we are concerned that there is not enough leadership given by the Government in terms of preparation by business for the euro,'' said Sir Clive Thompson, president of the Confederation of British Industry, the influential employers' group. **********--------------------        Interest Rates Lowered **********(By The Associated Press) -- The central banks in Spain, Portugal and Sweden cut key lending rates yesterday in an effort to maintain economic growth. **********The cuts could put added pressure on Germany, France and other European nations to trim their rates. **********The Bank of Spain lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent.

There are about two slats in place out of two million.\" **********Santander Investment's strategist, Christopher Wood, called the plan \"another warehousing solution,\" and criticized the idea that bad banks would stay in business for years to come. **********\"Do not be surprised if many of the companies enjoying continued funding are politically influential construction companies,\" he warned. **********ING's reading for the yen in the coming months is that it will bounce within a wide range. The dollar could get as high as 160 yen after central bank intervention, or as low as 120 as hedge funds continue to be tempted by borrowing yen at interest rates five percentage points below what they earn by converting the money into dollars and buying U.S. Treasury paper. **********Others are even gloomier, from the point of view of anyone hoping for a stable, or stronger, yen. Martin Armstrong of Princeton Economics said the dollar would rise to 200 yen by year's end, because deregulation of Japan's financial sector will free $9 trillion, or 40 percent of the world's savings, to go abroad. Not only might the yen fall as a result, but so could Japanese government bonds, the high-price paper responsible for some of the lowest interest rates anywhere, ever. **********\"If the yen continues to be weak, there's little room for the ringgit or baht to recover,\" Mr. Gong said. If the yen stays weak, in his view the most vulnerable currency is the Singapore dollar, which he thinks is overvalued against other Southeast Asian currencies. **********The major risk for Asian currencies, other than a weakening yen, is that countries in the region will decide that lower interest rates and the risk of accelerating inflation are preferable to the high rates that have choked off investment. The move to print money may inflate away a lot of domestic debt, but in the meantime currencies would surely weaken. **********The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that almost all of Asia's currencies will be weaker against the dollar next year than they are now. So how to profit if things seem gloomy in the shorter term? **********As volatile as the markets now are, in many cases they are far less liquid, as imports plunge, trade financing evaporates and foreign investors flee to the safety of other stock markets. One of the most liquid is the Australian dollar, which moves along with feelings about the yen and is easy to sell short. Lower growth in Japan means lower commodity prices, and commodities are what drive Australia's economy. Australia's largest single market is Japan, most of Australia's big customers are in Asia, and commodities consitute nine of its top 10 exports. **********At about 61 U.S. cents, the Australian dollar is stronger now than when it bottomed earlier this year at 58 cents and it also has plenty of upside for those optimists who think Asia has seen the worst of its troubles. **********Jardine Fleming, Fidelity, Rothschild Asset Management and Lloyds International all offer Australia dollar money-market funds in Hong Kong. Australian dollar futures trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which on its Web site explains how derivatives work and walks users through a simulated futures trade. . **********One cautionary note: Do not believe analysts who say a currency is strong because it is not fully tradeable. In May, Taiwan banned some trading in nondeliverable forward contracts (an agreement to buy and sell dollars at a prearranged price and date that is settled in local currency), but the Taiwan dollar has weakened anyway. The trade restrictions were blamed for sharp falls in the stock market as risk-averse foreign investors bailed out. **********For further information: **********CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE Web site: www.cme.com **********JARDINE FLEMING.

''The White House consistently rebuffed my direct approaches and my request for a meeting with the President.'' **********When President Kim of South Korea returns to the United States for a nine-day state visit beginning on Saturday, he will get better treatment. This time he is to stay in Washington at Blair House, the American Government's official guest residence, and address a joint session of Congress. **********Mr. Kim, the onetime dissident who became South Korea's President in February, will also get a state dinner at the White House, receive a human rights award and pick up an honorary degree at Georgetown University. **********Yet, asked if he was tempted to pick up the telephone at Blair House and place an ''I told you so'' call to some of the former gate-keepers who used to fend him off, Mr. Kim paused only a moment to savor the idea. He grinned and demurred, but he said he did draw some lessons from his reversal of fortune. **********''You have to live long,'' he said with a sparkle in his eye. **********Mr. Kim has indeed lived long -- he is 74 -- and he credits his survival in part to American intervention when Korean dictators planned to kill him. That makes his state visit an especially poignant moment, diplomats and Korean officials say. **********Moreover, Mr. Kim in some ways trumpets what are often called American values even more than Americans do. **********''The fact that the United States so frequently speaks out on human rights issues in other countries, sometimes to the disadvantage of its own national interests, that is what makes the United States great, that is what makes it earn respect from around the world,'' Mr. Kim said in an hourlong interview this week in Blue House, the presidential mansion in Seoul. **********Still, Mr. Kim acknowledged that in some respects he is now in the position of the officials who fended him off when he was a dissident. Asked if he sometimes faces a choice between his moral principles and the dictates of statecraft, when he ponders whether to speak out on issues  like human rights in China, Mr. Kim nodded. **********''I am faced with that dilemma,'' he said. ''And certainly I cannot say at this point whether I will or will not make a public statement about that. But I do have a great deal of personal interest in what happens in China and Myanmar, especially Myanmar,'' he added, referring to the country formerly known as Burma. **********These days, Mr. Kim has emerged to some extent as a spokesman for the region and not just his country. The state visit to America will add to his stature and to this regional leadership role, a role that he seems to relish. **********''As painful as the current situation is, we wish to use it as much as we can to push through economic reforms, to make our democracy stronger, so that we will be a model for the Asian region, a model that says that you have to promote democracy and the free market in parallel, and that the future of Asia lies in this model,'' Mr. Kim said. **********Yet for Mr. Kim to sustain his role as a model for the region, he will first have to overcome South Korea's economic crisis. And that too is a reason for the state visit: Mr. Kim will begin his visit in the financial capital of New York, not the political capital of Washington, and he will emphasize South Korea's efforts to restructure its economy and woo investors. **********''It is of utmost importance that we win foreign investment,'' Mr. Kim said. ''With the capital that comes in with foreign investment, we can pay back our debts. With the foreign capital will come new ways of management, making our management more rational and breathing new life into our economy.'' **********After arriving in New York on Saturday and helping open the Korea Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and speaking to several organizations, Mr. Kim is to go to Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Clinton and his speech to Congress. On Thursday, he will travel to California and deliver a speech at Stanford University and visit Silicon Valley. On June 12 he will go on to Los Angeles, a center for Korean-Americans, and will leave for home the next day. **********Mr. Kim was hailed at home as virtually a savior when he took office, even as he lectured his nation on the need to accept the pain of layoffs and restructuring. But in recent weeks, some business analysts have said the steam has gone out of his initiatives. **********Mr. Kim disagrees. He said he is concerned about rising unemployment but still confident that South Korea is on the right track to recreate itself as a more open and market-oriented economy. **********''What gives me hope is that we are probably over the worst phase of the foreign currency crunch,'' he said, adding that foreign exchange reserves have risen from $3.8 billion last December to $34 billion today. Interest rates have dropped and a trade deficit has turned into a substantial surplus, he noted. **********One concern for foreign investors has been the militancy of South Korean unions, which have been hostile to layoffs and have turned to strikes and sometimes violence to resist restructuring. The unions have agreed to postpone strikes until Mr. Kim's return from the United States, however, and Mr. Kim argues that the worst is over for the labor unrest.

By 8:30 she is at her desk, pouring herself a bowl of breakfast cereal and firing up her computer for a glimpse at what the planet has wrought while she slept. **********What greets her on her computer's screen is selected and displayed by My Yahoo, a free service by Yahoo, the giant Internet information company based in Santa Clara, Calif. My Yahoo shows Ms. Nierenberg how many E-mail messages she has waiting to be read and a sampling of news headlines -- she can decide to call up any of the articles on domestic, political and international news for a more detailed look. Weather forecasts for her area and for Boston, her hometown, are parked in a corner of the screen. **********That wake-up dose of Internet offerings is, more or less, created specifically for Ms. Nierenberg, who, while computer savvy, doesn't consider herself a computer nerd (she does not have a computer at home, for instance). What she gets is a tailor-made collection of information that she has informed Yahoo she wants to get regularly. ''It definitely saves me time,'' said Ms. Nierenberg, whose work requires her to be on a computer for at least eight hours a day. ''It's nice to be able to push one button whenever I log on and to get all of this.'' **********The process that delivers all of that daily digital data to her and millions more is called personalization, the newest wave washing over the ever-changing shores of the Internet. After years of shaky starts, personalization promises to re-emphasize the personal in personal computing. **********Without a ''personalized page,'' as she likes to call it, Ms. Nierenberg would have to resort to laboriously searching the Internet herself, plowing through more than 650,000 sites on the Web alone. One of the chief ideas driving personalization, many Internet experts say, is that the Internet, a victim of its own success, has become too voluminous for most people to handle comfortably and efficiently. If you're not using personalization, said Joe Kraus, senior vice president and co-founder of Excite, ''you are not taking advantage of the medium.'' **********The thinking behind personalization goes something like this: What if your computer ''knew'' you, had a reasonable sense of your on-line interests and preferences and could respond to them? Forcing the computer to conform to your information needs rather than forcing you to conform to the computer's requirements is a step, many agree, toward realizing the vision that Nicholas P. Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls ''the daily me.'' **********Services like My Yahoo, My Excite and even the set-top Web cruiser My Web TV (like other personalized features offered by America Online and the Microsoft Network, it is part of a service that requires a monthly fee) are increasingly fetching the kinds of content that their users say they want: specific types of news, weather forecasts, sports scores and schedules, stock quotations, horoscopes, television schedules, movie show times and state lottery results, for example. Many of these services also feature lists of users' favorite Web sites, chat rooms and message boards, along with daily health tips, travel alerts and on-line reminders of occasions like anniversaries and birthdays of relatives and friends. **********''It is empowering,'' said Steve Boxer, a  computer consultant who owns Pachyderm Consulting in Brooklyn, speaking of his experience with personalization. ''It really molds your computer to your interests.'' **********The first personalization service from a major on-line company was the Microsoft Network, or MSN. When it began in the fall of 1995, it offered users a relatively primitive capacity to customize the kinds of information they received. In January the following year, Excite created My Excite, which was followed that summer by My Yahoo. In July, Netscape, the leading Internet browser company, started offering My Netscape. While America Online offers its members very limited personalization with My AOL, a company spokesman said AOL will begin a much more fully featured service called My News in the next few weeks.. **********Competition among the companies offering personalization is intense, resembling at times the browser wars between Netscape and Microsoft. Refinements by one are often followed quickly by similar refinements by the others. **********Representatives of the personalization services refused to disclose just how many dollars each company has poured into creating and continually tweaking its service. But Mr. Kraus did say that his company, Excite, had spent a ''significant investment in terms of manpower, money, hardware and engineering time'' in creating its version of personalization, called My Excite. **********Nor will the companies reveal the number of subscribers for each service. ''It has exceeded some expectations,'' said Henry Sohn, a senior producer for personalization for Yahoo. ''Part of that is due to the overall growth in the Internet with each quarter. But it is clear that personalization services are really popular.'' **********THE promise of personalization had been on the lips of computer visionaries for years, even while the Internet struggled to find its identity. In the mid-1990's, software makers began selling off-the-shelf products like Pointcast Network that automatically log on to the Net, download categories of information broadly defined by users and then log off. These products, known as ''push'' technologies, began falling out of favor because they tended to be resource hogs and to deposit overwhelming amounts of information on computer hard drives. **********As many began to complain that push information was not selective enough, some users started looking for something that could pull from the Internet more specific information that matched their interests. **********''Back then, people didn't know what they wanted, so they wanted things pushed at them,'' said Rob Bernstein, a senior editor at Yahoo Internet Life, a monthly magazine about Net use. ''The Net pretty much rejected that idea. Pull it down. That is the idea of personalization.'' **********But the idea of personalization, some experts acknowledged, has been difficult to sell. Part of the problem, said David Sze, vice president for network programming and content at Excite, is that personalization is hard to describe. The concept, he noted, tends to ''come off very soft, vague.'' **********Using personalization is hardly automatic. First, you must register for it. (Many of the companies offering personalization, including Excite, Yahoo and MSN, have been trying to entice potential users by including very visible links from their popular home pages to their personalization pages.) Registration also means filling out an on-line questionnaire that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a half-hour to complete. (My Excite goes another step, giving brief descriptions of why it requests certain information. It says, for example, ''Your birth date is used to provide your horoscope.'') Designers of personalization services noted that the more information users provided about themselves, the more personalized the service would be. **********The My Yahoo form is much more tedious when it asks users to choose the information they want and how it is to be displayed. Each user enters preferences for a front page and pages for subjects like health, entertainment, business, chat and message boards. Each subject page has a dozen slots, and each slot holds a pull-down menu offering 36 choices of content, like sports scoreboards, information about vitamins and herbs, and news headlines. **********A user may choose one menu item for each slot. Each selection leads to that categories of information being displayed and updated whenever the personalized pages are viewed. My Yahoo goes even further, pressing for even more detail about a user's ''specific interests.'' The categories there, like news, life styles, music and shopping, are more finely tuned. The answers may very well determine whether the Epicurious Web site for fine cooking appears on your finished page rather than Gamespot, which is popular among computer twitch gamers. **********''It helps us in a number of ways to offer a service that users find more relevant,'' Mr. Sohn at Yahoo said of the questionnaire. **********Once the services have an idea of what users want, they extract the information from various sources. To do that, they use relationships with news operations and other partners as well as their own powerful search engines. In most cases, as with My Yahoo, My Excite and My Netscape, the information is stored in central databases. **********When someone goes on line and types in a user name and a password, a cookie -- an identifying tag stored on the user's computer -- tells the personalization service who is requesting information. Based on what is in the cookie (for My Netscape it is a 16-digit number) the information is unlocked from the database and sent in a fraction of a second to the user. Most of the services regularly update their information and use both machines and people to match the right streams of information with the right users, personalization managers say. **********Just how these services actually work depends on closely held proprietary technologies, but many personalization operators agree that the services have been made possible by advances in database hardware and software in the last several years, by high-speed user-indentification systems and by the capacity to generate pages on the fly over the Internet. **********''Making it easy for people is our overarching design point,'' said Eckart Walther, product manager for My Netscape. ''It makes information come to you rather than you going to the information.'' **********Nathan Beckord, a 26-year-old research associate for an investment bank in San Francisco, uses My Yahoo to check his stock portfolio and to glance at news about his investments. **********''For each portfolio, I have it customized to display what I want, quote the volume, and below that it shows the news,'' he said. Mr. Beckord also has the service set up as his default page, so it is the first thing he sees when he goes on line at work or at home. **********Users like Mr. Beckord are very useful to Internet companies, which is why the companies invested in personalization. The detailed information users give them about exactly what they want to see on line serves as a kind of survey. The information helps personalization managers decide what kinds of content to add, maintain or remove from their offerings. More important, many of the same managers said, the information makes it possible to match the advertising to users' interests and needs. **********Much as sporting goods manufacturers know that they have a better chance of reaching their market by advertising on ESPN, the national cable sports network, rather than with general-interest programs, advertisers are looking for much of the same result by having their advertisements sent over the Internet to people whose declared interests identify them as likely customers, explained Mr. Sze, of Excite. **********Mr. Sohn, of Yahoo, offered an example. ''If we know someone is not interested in travel,'' he said, ''then we are not likely to display an ad from an airline or travel agency.'' And the better his company is able to aim advertising, he added, the more it can charge for that advertising. **********But Mr. Sze said the use of personalization as an effective advertising tool had just begun. ''The true value of this is not being realized the way it is going to be,'' said Mr. Sze, adding that on a scale of 1 to 10, personalization's use of advertising was in the 3-to-5 range. But, he said, Excite is preparing to step up its use of targeted advertising on the Internet. **********Mr. Walther also noted that personalization made good business sense because it was a way to capture more users, people who are approaching the Internet differently from their early-adopter predecessors. **********''We are seeing a lot more practical use of the Web,'' he said. ''A lot of people don't go on the Web to just have fun.'' He said people tended to care more about how much time they were on the Internet and how much they accomplished. Personalization, he said, especially speaks to such users. **********And, added Mr. Boxer, the New York computer consultant, many new Internet users start with personalization services and keep returning to those companies. ''Everyone has to start someplace,'' he said, ''and the people who control the starting place hold some very valuable real estate.'' **********Because personalization requires the user to give a series of very specific preferences, there are growing concerns about what companies will do with all this new information. Mr. Sohn and other personalization service operators said the industry followed  strict guidelines to protect users' privacy. Many of the companies' policies regarding privacy are clearly stated on line and linked to the questionnaires. **********''We care very deeply about privacy,'' Mr. Sohn said. ''We go overboard to make users aware that we don't sell usage information to anyone.'' **********Another objection to the current personalization services is that they simply do not go far enough. Walter Bender, associate director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, said he would like to see additional levels of integration between, for example, on-line information and personal on-line calendars. The result, he said, would be more sophisticated services that would not only deliver tailored content but would also match that information with what a user was actually doing. You're taking a business trip to the Caribbean? Your computer would start delivering news, weather and travel information about the Caribbean as your departure date approached. **********Nonetheless, many Internet experts say, personalization is expected to be the buzz on the Internet for years to come, as it is tweaked and refined along the way. ''It's not going to go away,'' Mr. Sze predicted. **********It is simply a matter of Internet destiny, others say. **********''This is the only medium,'' Mr. Kraus said, ''that is inherently personalizable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/05/business/company-news-f-m-bancorp-planning-to-buy-monocacy-bancshares.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-09-05", "snippet": "F&M Bancorp will buy Monocacy Bancshares Inc for $82.7 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F&M BANCORP PLANNING TO BUY MONOCACY BANCSHARES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; F&M BANCORP PLANNING TO BUY MONOCACY BANCSHARES", "body_text": " **********F&M Bancorp, parent of Farmers and Mechanics National Bank, agreed yesterday to buy Monocacy Bancshares Inc. for $82.7 million in stock.

Mr. de Silguy told a group of bankers, business leaders and economists that the \"euro is not a leap in the dark\" but is built on \"rock-solid political commitment.\" **********To give grounding to his enthusiasm, he noted that long-term interest rates in Europe \u2014 determined by the markets and not by politicians \u2014 have converged to record low levels in the 11 European countries set to form the euro zone. **********While he did not venture to estimate to what extent the euro would supplant the dollar as a reserve currency held by central banks, he did predict that the switch would begin immediately. **********As the euro accounts for a greater share of reserves, he said, the result would be a more balanced monetary system, as well as new trade and investment opportunities that would \"create additional incentives for policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic to look outwards.\" Trans-Atlantic cooperation will be necessary, he said, \"to avoid protracted currency misalignments which could provoke protectionist reactions.\" **********The use of the euro in commercial transactions, he added, would spread quickly from euro-zone countries to nations on their borders, and then quickly around the Mediterranean. He said it would make strong inroads on the dollar, which is now used for 50 percent of global commercial transactions and 80 percent of financial deals. **********The volume of new government debt issued in euro will \"be equal at least to that issued by the U.S. Treasury,\" he said, without stipulating a time period. \"I do not expect brutal change overnight, but progressively.\" **********His comments came after a week in which foreign exchange markets took center stage in the Japanese economic drama, a fresh sign of the power of currency values in determining a nation's fiscal well-being. Japanese authorities intervened to prop up the yen against the dollar amid fears that a weak yen could further destabilize Asia and swell the U.S. trade deficit. **********The American position on the euro was voiced on Tuesday by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who said: \"It has been our view \u2014 the view of the United States government \u2014 for a long time that anything that benefits Europe economically is good for the United States.\" **********\"I don't think it's going to adversely affect the position of the dollar,\" Mr. Rubin said, \"either as a reserve currency or with respect to the use of the dollar in international finance.\" **********The euro, following a road map to be confirmed at a special EU meeting in Brussels starting May 1, will be used in financial exchanges in the 11 euro zone countries starting Jan. 1; it will circulate in note and coin form three years later. **********Most European traders, economists and officials have expressed confidence that the euro will be a sound and stable currency. Exchange rates among the countries of the euro zone \u2014 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain \u2014 have been stable, and interest rates have been converging. **********Most economists stress the gradualism of the process. **********\"I don't see Japan or anyone else flocking to the euro on Day 1,\" Greg Berger, a Treasury official in the U.S. mission to the European Union said recently in Brussels, \"particularly selling dollars to buy euros. And at the end of it all, if the Euro begins to put pressure on the dollar, the net effect is to put pressure on the United States to pursue sound economic policies.\" **********But some analysts have raised concerns about short-term ups and downs. **********\"The dollar-euro rate can go anywhere,\" said Daniel Gros, deputy director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. \"It can be volatile. But in the short run, I don't think a lot will happen.\" He said he expected the world's central banks eventually to split their dollar and euro holdings evenly. **********Francois Charriere, managing partner of Andersen Consulting in Paris, said: \"In the short term, we may have very high volatility between the dollar and the euro, given the vast amounts of dollars to move. But then it'll stabilize.\" **********But Alan Watson, chairman of Burson-Marsteller Europe, predicted a more rapid rise for the euro. **********\"I have no doubt the euro will become a trading and reserve currency quite quickly,\" accounting for as much as 40 percent of global reserves \"in the next few years,\" he said recently in London. \"That's a situation the U.S. has not faced in the postwar period. That's going to have an impact on the dollar, on the American deficit.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/business/patents-laundries-beware-here-comes-prototype-improved-wash-wear-cotton-shirt.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1998-06-15", "snippet": "John Wong has patented for TAL Apparel Ltd process to perfect wash-and-wear cotton shirt by embedding adhesive material into seams to prevent threads from shrinking or puckering; shirts with company's maintenance-free seams are already on market; ...", "word_count": 856, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Laundries, beware!

Here comes a prototype improved wash-and-wear cotton shirt.", "body_text": " **********COTTON shirt is soft, comfortable and, very often, wrinkled -- especially right after it is pulled out of the dryer. The sleeves and panels come out faintly lined, like a dry riverbed, but it is the cuffs, collar and pockets that take -- and show -- the real beating. A bit of time and effort with an iron and spray starch can restore a smooth sheen, but nothing looks as neatly tailored as a cotton shirt fresh from the dry cleaner. **********It costs more, too. Permanent- press polyester and then wrinkle-free cottons were hailed as eliminating the need for ironing or dry cleaning. But even when the best of those materials went into a shirt, the seams would pucker. That is because thread used to sew the shirt together shrinks at a rate different from the fabric. So, fresh from the dryer, even wrinkle-free fabrics looked rumpled around the edges. **********This makes a prototype shirt sewn with a patented seam technology all the more remarkable. Half the shirt is made of ordinary fabric and thread, the other half from wrinkle-free cotton and treated seams. After washing in warm water and ordinary detergent, the shirt comes out of a hot tumble-dry cycle looking as if the right side had just been removed from the store packaging. The collar and cuff are flat and flawless. There is a temptation to throw it back in the wash just to make sure it's not an optical illusion. **********The patented technology belongs to TAL Apparel Ltd., a Hong-Kong based clothing maker that produces 30 million shirts a year for companies like Calvin Klein, Eddie Bauer, the Gap, Banana Republic and Burberry's. The inventor is the company's textile scientist, John Wong. **********Mr. Wong perfected the wash-and-wear cotton shirt by embedding an adhesive material into the seams to prevent threads from shrinking or puckering. TAL's Washington patent lawyer, Bradford E. Kile, said the adhesive was applied via a fusible tape about an inch wide. He explained that the tape was laid between adjoining pieces of fabric, and  ''the thread is sewn through the outermost layer and the fusible bonding strip and the layer beneath it.'' **********''After the stitch is made, the seam is placed under heat and pressure, and the seam is fused together,'' he added. **********Mr. Kile said the adhesive tape adds only pennies to a shirt's cost. **********''I have all my shirts laundered, and it costs a dollar a shirt,'' Mr. Kile said. ''The starch tends to shrink the collar, and that can be harsh and irritate the neck. The added cost to manufacturing is saved after the first time you take the shirt to the laundry.'' **********The seam technology is designed to last for the life of the shirt, Mr. Kile said, adding that TAL is ''using the technology themselves and including it in all the seams that their clients want.'' TAL makes shirts in Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia. It has also licensed its patents to competitors like Phillips-Van Heusen. Shoppers can already buy shirts with maintenance-free seams, if they know what to look for. **********''This just came out at the end of 1997, and it's going to have a negative impact on the laundry industry, but I guess they'll survive,'' Mr. Kile said. ''Brooks Brothers makes it in pink, blue, yellow and white. But you have to ask for it, and they'll send it to you in the mail.'' **********Mr. Wong received patents 5,713,292; 5,590,615 and 5,568,779. **********New Way to Replace Elevator Doors **********The Americans with Disabilities Act stipulates that elevator doors must open and close automatically. But many elevators in older apartment buildings have swinging or telescoping doors or gates that must be operated by hand. In New York City, high-rise public housing buildings from the 1940's and 1950's still feature their original swinging elevator doors. Past solutions for replacing them included taking space from inside the elevator car, or tearing out walls in the hallway to accommodate new equipment. Making elevator cars smaller is inconvenient for all users, not only the disabled, and removing walls during construction is dangerous **********Harold Friedman says he has a better solution. Mr. Friedman owns the National Elevator Cab and Door Company in New York City and has patented a sliding elevator door assembly and installation process that uses the space occupied by swinging door mechanisms. He came up with the solution after ripping open a wall to replace a swing door the traditional way. **********''I had an image of our company and my picture on the 10 o'clock news because somebody fell down an elevator shaft,'' Mr. Friedman explained. With his system, the old door assembly is replaced with a frame for a sliding door. The frame is attached adjacent to the car door, and a track and hanger system is added to the transom area above the door. **********''The door then slides into the frame like a pocket door,'' Mr. Friedman explained. The side and transom frames are covered with the stationary panels. ''We can do it in one day.'' **********The patented system has already been installed in older buildings in New York City. Mr. Friedman received patent 5,673,770. **********Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/news/they-soften-schroeders-position-social-democrats-talk-up-the-euro.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1998-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 892, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "They Soften Schroeder's Position : Social Democrats Talk Up the Euro", "print_headline": "They Soften Schroeder's Position : Social Democrats Talk Up the Euro", "body_text": " **********FRANKFURT\u2014                     - A day after Germany's Social Democrats nominated a candidate for chancellor who once recommended that Europe consider a delay of its planned single currency, the party took pains Tuesday to portray itself as a supporter of the euro. **********In a reassurance to Bonn's European partners, the Social Democratic Party's parliamentary leader, Rudolf Scharping, issued a response to the appeal Monday by its candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, for a fresh debate on the risks of currency union. **********Immediately after his nomination, Mr. Schroeder promised to convene a \"roundtable of the best brains in the land to analyze the risks of the euro in an impartial manner.\" To lead the panel, Mr. Schroeder said he would recruit Karl Otto Poehl, a former president of the German central bank and a Social Democrat. **********In an interview on German radio, Mr. Scharping touted his party's pro-European credentials. \"The goal of our party is to protect the consumers and ensure the stability of the currency,\" he said. \"This has nothing to do with Euro-skepticism.\" **********Known more for his pragmatism and populism than for his convictions, Mr. Schroeder recognizes that monetary union has gained too much momentum to be delayed without unleashing chaos in Europe's economic and political affairs, political observers said. **********\"He will not do anything to undermine the position of his party, it is not worth it,\" said Dieter Roth, senior researcher at the Forschungs Gruppe Wahlen, an independent political research firm. \"The whole discussion will be over in May and the election is not until September,\" said Mr. Roth, referring to the selection of the euro's launching nations by European Union leaders in early May. **********Although Mr. Schroeder spent much of last year honing an image as a Euro-skeptic, he has distanced himself since then from Germany's hard-line opponents of the single currency. He kept the issue on the back burner during the campaign before his re-election Sunday as state premier of Lower Saxony, where his emphasis on Germany's record unemployment and his strident attacks on Chancellor Helmut Kohl won him a strong majority. **********Attempts by the Social Democrats to exploit voter fears over the loss of the trusted Deutsche mark failed to win votes in several state elections in the last two years, most recently in Hamburg last September \u2014 a misstep that Mr. Schroeder was careful not to repeat in his state. **********Despite his latest calls for a review of any risks, Bonn's European partners probably have little to worry about if the chancellorship switches hands in the Sept. 27 election, said Holger Schmieding, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt. **********\"The issue might have had some value before the Hamburg election in attracting right-wing votes, but it will not be interesting after May,\" Mr. Roth said. **********Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats have accused Mr. Schroeder of populism over his calls for a delay in the inauguration of the euro in January if the EU fails to apply the euro's budget deficit benchmarks strictly. But adopting an anti-euro stance has become more difficult in Germany since all 11 candidate nations announced last week that they had succeeded in meeting the deficit benchmarks, Mr. Schmieding said. **********\"In any event, the political decision on the euro was made long ago,\" Mr. Scharping told German radio."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/14/technology/library-auto-racing-simulations-road-races-are-challenge-but-graphics-don-t-keep.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Siano", "pub_date": "1998-05-14", "snippet": "Joseph Siano, editor at The Times who covered auto racing for the paper from 1989 to 1997, evaluates CD-ROM game Cart Precision Racing, from Microsoft; photo (M)", "word_count": 495, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Road Races Are a Challenge But Graphics Don't Keep Up", "print_headline": "LIBRARY/AUTO RACING SIMULATIONS; Road Races Are a Challenge But Graphics Don't Keep Up", "body_text": " **********CART PRECISION RACING **********(Microsoft; $54.95; Windows 95 and NT.) **********IF a steady diet of left turns isn't for you, this simulator provides a mix of high-speed ovals and twisty road-racing courses, negotiated in a much faster and more technologically exotic form of racer: the Indy car. Like Nascar Racing 2, however, CART Precision Racing does not contain the most famous racetrack of all, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Thanks to the real-world politics of motor sports, that race is part of the rival Indy Racing League series (which licenses its own simulation game through ABC Sports). **********The CART game (the name refers to the Championship Auto Racing Teams series) is also missing the driver with the most famous last name in the sport: Michael Andretti, whose family licenses its name to another game maker. But you can still drive Mr. Andretti's car, or that of any other driver in the 1997 CART season. The tutorials here -- narrated on the disk by Bobby Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 winner -- are very good, explaining the proper techniques for various types of turns as well as how to brake and steer. The accompanying manual contains maps of each of the 17 courses on the disk, with pointers on which gear the car should be in at each turn. Patrick Carpentier, last season's rookie of the year, used this simulator to familiarize himself with the real racetracks. **********Once on the track, you can have the proper path through each turn (or the ''line,'' as racers call it) illustrated by a red stripe, as well as by ghost highway cones. Nigel Bennett, a noted Indy-car designer, provides voice-over tips for the dozens of mechanical adjustments players can make. As with all these games, a set of default settings is automatically used unless a player chooses otherwise. **********This game has the weakest graphics of the games reviewed here; the graphics are fluttery and a touch jerky, although with minimum pixelation. The trackside scenery just barely outran the car -- the highway ramps over the downtown Vancouver circuit would grow before your eyes -- although the background scenery, like the Gateway Arch and the rest of the St. Louis skyline at one track, was good. The flutter can be eliminated with simpler graphics settings, but these produce very pixelated and jerky images. **********To run the game, Microsoft recommends a 166-megahertz chip, 32 megabytes of RAM, 100 free megabytes on the hard drive, a 6X CD-ROM and a super VGA graphics card. **********The first thing you will probably want to do with CART Precision Racing is mute the annoying music that plays whenever you are on the track. Otherwise, the sound quality is good. **********Tip: During a race, make sure you don't accidentally steer into the pit lane; if you do, the game automatically assumes that you want to make a pit stop, a time-consuming process you cannot override."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/17/technology/user-s-guide-a-second-look-at-aol-the-refurbished-ellis-island-of-the-net.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Slatalla", "pub_date": "1998-09-17", "snippet": "Article appraises America Online's new 4.0 version of its software; drawing (M)", "word_count": 1043, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Second Look at AOL, the Refurbished Ellis Island of the Net", "print_headline": "USER'S GUIDE; A Second Look at AOL, the Refurbished Ellis Island of the Net", "body_text": " **********EVERY society has its own class system, and so it is with the Internet. So, of course, the people who were first on line -- the early settlers who can reminisce about the good old days of the Arpanet -- get the most points for snob appeal. They are the on-line equivalent of those who claim that their ancestors were on the Mayflower. **********It is this class system that explains the simmering resentment among early adopters toward America Online. That on-line service has long been a kind of wired Ellis Island, a gateway through which the great unwashed arrive on the Internet shore. I felt no gratitude to America Online for easing my own on-line arrival a few years ago because I, too, wanted desperately to be mistaken for the kind of blueblood who had been on line since the early days, a charter member of the Daughters of the Internet Revolution. It never occurred to me to applaud the service for creating a painless gateway with its easy installation and setup process and its See-Dick-Run interface. **********As soon as I could, I traded in my place on AOL's crowded network (where I might as well have been michele43333759329602349-579873493@aol.com) for an E-mail address with more cachet. Around the end of 1995, I abandoned AOL altogether, complaining about the clunky nature of the service's proprietary browser, the paucity of sophisticated E-mail features and the relentless stream of advertisements that greet the masses upon logging on. **********Only in recent weeks, as America Online began with great fanfare to roll out the new 4.0 version of its software, have I looked inside my soul and wondered, Was I too quick to judge? After all, the service has  attracted more than 13 million customers, a number that keeps growing. The only fair thing to do would be to test the 4.0 version -- as objectively as possible, given my social-climbing tendencies -- to see if the AOL software could meet my needs. **********Truthfully, I did not think I would be interested in many of the new features that AOL was most proud of, like the new design that mimics a browser or even a channel guide that makes it easier to navigate through such topics as Sports, News or Lifestyles. Even the new feature that enables users to change screen names without logging off held no appeal for me: I don't use aliases, nor do I allow my daughters to use my account. **********The only on-line activities I engage in regularly are E-mail and Web browsing. No gaudy welcome screen greets me when my modem connects. Instead, I rely on a tiny, tasteful icon depicting two linked computers. Could AOL do better than my current minimalist setup? **********First, I had to download AOL 4.0 from www.aol.com. Although the final version for Windows was released at the end of July, production is still under way on the CD-ROM's. AOL expects to start mailing millions and millions of the disks within the next month, however, just in time for my cranky friend Ron Reason to continue his annual Halloween tradition of handing them out to unsuspecting trick-or-treaters in his South Florida neighborhood. (The Macintosh version will lag by a few weeks, an AOL spokeswoman said.) **********In the meantime, I was surprised that downloading the 4.0 version -- which warned that it might need as much as 17.5 megabytes on my hard drive -- seemed to take forever. Assuming that the process would end quickly, I sat at my desk, waiting. I flipped through the entire autumn Pottery Barn catalog. I phoned the toll-free number to get some information about velvet drapes. Still downloading. Called back to order the drapes. Still downloading. Worried drapes would be wrong color. Phoned to request complete set of drapery fabric swatches (free). Rebuffed in attempts to get Pottery Barn saleswoman to confirm whether this year's ''plum'' differs from last year's ''plum -- 1198134.'' Still downloading. Composed frosty letter in my mind to Pottery Barn. **********Luckily for the people at Pottery Barn's customer service department, the download was completed before I wrote the letter. I phoned Jeanie Ryan, a spokeswoman for America Online, to accuse her of forcing me to purchase unnecessary window treatments. **********''One hour? That's not bad -- you're on the good end,'' Ms. Ryan said. She explained that Microsoft's Internet Explorer was integrated with the new AOL software so users who have not already installed the browser could wait for up to three hours for the packgage to download. ''We thought people would run away screaming,'' Ms. Ryan confided. (Or at least just wait to go trick-or-treating!) ''Yet millions of people have sat through it, and we're like, oh my gosh.'' The good news was that installation and setup took me just three minutes more. **********Although determined to ignore the bright colors of the welcome screen, I had to admit that AOL 4.0's newly designed toolbar across the top of the screen was very helpful. Click on any of the three buttons on the left to use E-mail. Click on My AOL, then Preferences, then Marketing to speedily cancel all those ''valuable product and service offers'' that AOL and its partners serve up via E-mail, phone solicitation, the Postal Service and pop-up on-screen windows. And AOL 4.0 eliminates many of the tedious delays found in earlier versions. To start surfing the Net instantly, type a Web address in the space right under the icons. If you prefer another browser, it is easy to minimize the AOL window and open Netscape Navigator in its place. **********But the main thing that bothers me about AOL was that the E-mail features are still not robust enough. Unlike my Eudora E-mail program, AOL has no function that allows me to sort messages by date, sender, status, priority, label, size -- or even by various shades of plum. **********Nor does it allow me to attach a preconfigured signature file -- you know, the kind that gives my name, phone number and a quote from Descartes. ''We're working on that,'' Ms. Ryan said. **********I won't trade in my current setup for AOL yet. But, amazingly, I did manage to snag the simple and understated slatalla@aol.com as my new E-mail address.

But they can't hide their delight at having left the rat race before they were too old to realize their dreams. **********Virtually every plan to put Social Security back on a sound financial footing calls for pushing back the retirement age from 65 and trimming the benefits of early retirees. But that proposition flies in the face of Americans' conduct over the last three decades. The percentage of those choosing to retire before they are eligible for full Social Security benefits has more than doubled, to 71.1 percent of those receiving benefits in 1996, from 31.7 percent in 1965. **********The Woodlake golfers represent the trend. So do many people interviewed recently in other towns in Ocean and Monmouth counties, which have some of the highest concentrations of retirees outside Florida and Arizona. **********To this sampling of people who have retired early -- or are about to do so -- the idea of of giving up the daily grind has enormous appeal. **********''I marvel at people driven by the need to make money and have few other interests in life,'' reflected Joe Albowicz, 59, a former mortgage banker who essentially retired four years ago when his company was acquired by another and he was let go. **********''Being without a job and an office gave me a chance to ask myself, 'Where am I going? How much money is enough?' '' he said after completing a round of golf with friends. **********Mr. Albowicz, who has no pension, said he had accumulated enough money to live the next quarter-century in comfort just by drawing on the principal, without benefit of interest or dividends. Though without a pressing need to draw an early Social Security retirement benefit at age 62, he nonetheless said he was entitled to it, a sentiment echoed by others who, for the most part, are more dependent on the added income. **********Job dissatisfaction or burnout was often cited as the motivation to leave work early for those who could afford to do so. For many, fattened retirement programs, bolstered by zooming individual stock investments, helped move up the target date for retirement. No doubt that explained why the television set in the clubhouse bar was tuned to CNBC, the financial news network, with stock prices streaming across the bottom of the screen. **********''We may be the last generation able to enjoy this quality of life in our early 60's,'' said Marty Stern, 63, a retired manufacturer's representative. ''If in the future you can't retire until you are in your 70's, you are going to be a lot older and a lot less active. Who wants to sit at a desk all your working life and then sit around when you retire?'' **********''If you're still alive and breathing at that age,'' said another golfer, Ralph Arbia, half-jokingly. At age 59, Mr. Arbia has the sturdy build of a much younger man. **********Death, particularly early death, was a specter haunting some men who opted for early retirement. ''My father was 62 when he retired, and he dropped dead a while later,'' explained Joe Mento, who played a round of golf with some friends earlier this month to celebrate his 63d birthday, days after returning from a gambling vacation in Las Vegas, Nev. ''Let's face it: Men die early, so why hang around in a job if you can afford to have some fun before you check out?'' **********Mr. Mento sold his Brooklyn company, which rebuilt auto air-conditioners, and moved to the Jersey Shore to be near his grandchildren. **********''I wanted out; it was just a way of making money, and I hated it,'' he said with emphasis. **********For Luis Alvarez, 56, a construction worker on a road project in Monmouth County, the issue is enduring the rigors of outdoor work until he turns 62 and can collect early Social Security benefits. He said painful arthritis in his hands nearly cripples him on cold winter days, and speculated that those who wanted to push back the Social Security retirement age never carried a lunch pail to a job site on a raw day in January. **********As gingerly as Washington deals with Social Security, it seems more loath to address the spiraling costs of Medicare. And for many older workers, medical benefits are as much an issue in retirement planning as is a pension. **********Margaret Lewis, 57, of Manalapan, N.J., is a supervisor in the state employment services office in Freehold, and plans to retire at the end of this year, citing job burnout. Her husband, Michael, 58, is a self-employed paperhanger with no pension or medical benefits of his own.

Like many a child of postwar occupation, the mother was German, the father a foreigner. The date was June 20, 1948. **********But with the coming of a European single currency, its details agreed to at a heads of government meeting in Brussels this weekend, that 50th anniversary is likely to be much more of a wake. Among the 11 European nations ceding fiscal sovereignty as they shed marks, francs and pesetas for the euro, Germans will mourn the most. **********Anyone seeking to understand why need look only at the tumultuous days when the mark was born -- not simply the new coinage of a fallen realm, but the infant emblem of Germany's regeneration as postwar Europe's economic colossus. **********As the Brussels meeting got under way, the latest opinion survey here said 56 percent of Germans remained opposed to the new currency because its introduction, quite simply, meant the end of the mark that many people still associated with that first Volkswagen Beetle and that first postwar vacation in the sun -- the budding fruits of Germany's economic miracle. **********''The Deutsche mark is the incarnation of 40 or 50 years of prosperity,'' said Prof. Klaus von Beyme, a political scientist at Heidelberg University. And as they contemplate a future without it, many Germans are reminded of a past in which inflation wiped out savings and left their parents and grandparents bereft. ''Every monetary reform has been associated with a loss of money,'' Professor von Beyme said. ''And people are afraid.'' **********As of Jan. 1, 1999, the euro will be used in some electronic trading. By 2002, euro notes and coins will have banished not just the mark, but francs and many other currencies, in the one of the boldest financial adventures undertaken by a group of disparate lands. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl came under fire over the weekend for making a last-minute political deal with France to introduce the euro. Under the arrangement, Wim Duisenberg, a Dutchman favored by Germany, will step down voluntarily as head of the forthcoming European central bank after only four years on the job, to be replaced by a Frenchman. **********Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party lambasted Mr. Kohl's maneuvering to placate France, asserting that the Chancellor had ''lost trust over his foreign policy.'' Even allies of Mr. Kohl, including the Bavarian state premier, Edmund Stoiber, said the compromise had ''thrown shadows over the start of the currency union.'' **********The prickliness of Germans was perhaps not surprising, because in this country, the loss of the mark carries a lot more emotional freight than Europeans normally associate with pocketbook issues. Currencies, of course, are national totems -- just as the dollar is part of being American or the pound sterling, part of being British. **********But the mark was always more than that -- an emblem of a new respectability after the horrors of Nazism, of success and prosperity and, above all, of stability. **********As a measure of its meaning, consider, for instance, that the postwar mark -- the Deutsche mark in West Germany as distinct from the reichsmark of the Weimar and Nazi eras -- was born 11 months before the Bonn Government was created. It entered history on the front line of the cold war, at a time when many Germans were beginning to sense that postwar deprivation was coming to an end. **********''After the war, there was nothing to eat, nothing to wear,'' said Erika Ritter, now a pensioner, who was 18 when the new money was introduced. ''Everything was rationed and families would send their children into the food lines in relays, the queues were so long. We were given the new money with our ration cards, and the shops suddenly filled up with glasses, food, everything.'' **********Indeed, a commentator, Michael Schmidt-Klingenberg, writing in the news magazine Der Spiegel, said, ''The founding myth of the new state was not the Constitution, but the miracle of the store windows.'' **********From its birth, with Americans and the other Western Allies as midwives, the mark molded postwar Germany as a land whose fortunes were intertwined with those of the West and of capitalism. **********For 49 days from April 1948 onward, sequestered in an attic conference room near Kassel in central Germany, in a villa encircled by American barbed wire, a group of German financial experts, nudged forward by the Occupation powers -- the United States, Britain and France -- met quietly. As they met, rumors swirled about of an impending currency reform in a land that had no real currency. **********And when on June 20, 1948, Germans in the west were permitted to exchange 40 old, virtually worthless reichsmarks for 40 of the crisp new notes (printed in Philadelphia), the Soviet occupiers of eastern Germany followed suit, issuing their own Ostmarks. **********The dispute over which currency would be used in divided Berlin led to the Soviet blockade of the city, and to the beginning of the Berlin airlift. If ever there was an emblem of Germany's division, and a defining symbol for the split-up of Europe for decades to come, this was it. **********Compared with some other European currencies, the mark has kept its strength: These days, one mark has 27 percent of the buying power it had in 1948. By contrast, the Italian lira has 4 percent of its 1948 value. **********The fear of losing all that, perhaps, is why Chancellor Kohl has had some difficulty in persuading his compatriots that, as he frequently insists, the euro will be ''as stable as the mark.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/24/business/media-business-advertising-department-old-dogs-new-line-tricks-that-need-old.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-11-24", "snippet": "Autobytel.com Inc, which operates popular on-line car-buying service, will announce hiring of Grey Advertising as it ad agency; Autobytel.com will increase total spending next year from $20 million that was budgeted for 1998 (M)", "word_count": 748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From the department of old dogs and new, on-line tricks that need the old dogs' expertise.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; From the department of old dogs and new, on-line tricks that need the old dogs' expertise.", "body_text": " **********IN another demonstration of the blurring of the lines between on-line and off-line advertising and media realms, a leading Internet marketer is naming the world's ninth-largest agency to handle duties ranging from global brand-building to creating campaigns for television, magazines and newspapers. **********Autobytel.com Inc., which operates a popular on-line car-buying service, will announce today the hiring of Grey Advertising in New York as its agency for those traditional tasks, which will supplement the marketing efforts the company makes in cyberspace through the Grey interactive division.

''To help us become a household name like P.& G., we wanted an agency known for building brands globally with expertise beyond the Internet.'' **********''We knew it was time to build more of an emotional bond with consumers,'' she added, ''and you do that through traditional media.'' **********Ms. Benvenuto discussed the decision to hire Grey in an interview yesterday in midtown Manhattan. She was joined by executives of Grey and RBI Communications Inc., an advertising and public relations agency in Hollywood that created Autobytel.com spots for the 1997 and 1998 Super Bowls. RBI will continue handling corporate communications for Autobytel.com. **********The increased attention and business generated by those Super Bowl spots underscored for Autobytel.com ''the power of traditional media like television,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, and ''the need to take the traditional side more seriously.'' **********''A balance between driving the sale and driving the brand is what we're looking for,'' she added. **********Among the interactive marketers that have also recently hired traditional agencies to produce advertising off line are Snap, a search engine controlled by the NBC unit of the General Electric Company, which selected the San Francisco office of Saatchi & Saatchi, part of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., and ZDTV, a cable network operated by the Ziff-Davis unit of the Softbank Corporation, which chose the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone & Belding, owned by True North Communications. **********As cybermarketers look beyond agencies specializing in on-line advertising, mainstream shops are beefing up their interactive abilities. **********Wickersham Hunt Schwantner in Boston, for instance, which is owned by Snyder Communications, has agreed to acquire Berenson Isham & Partners, a Boston agency with billings estimated at $40 million that manages interactive assignments for such advertisers as Club Med, The Financial Times and Fidelity Investments. That deal was for cash and stock valued at $3 million. **********The hiring of Grey Advertising by Autobytel.com comes seven months after the company named the agency's on-line unit, Grey Interactive, to handle a variety of marketing communications assignments that included brand advertising and campaigns to run in traditional media. **********But ''we needed to take things to the next level,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, ''because I don't think you can build a brand with the Internet alone.'' **********''If we want to seed the likely prospects who will be on line next year, we have to start developing preferences for our brand off line,'' she said. **********Michael Rasmussen, the vice president at Grey Advertising who is group management supervisor on the Autobytel.com account, said the agency would ''operate as an integrated resource with all our disciplines working together,'' particularly as Autobytel.com expands internationally. Web sites are in the works for the first quarter of 1999 for Britain and the Nordic countries, to join the site operating for the United States and Canada (www.autobytel.com). **********The media services for the creative work produced by Grey Advertising and Grey Interactive, Mr. Rasmussen said, will be handled by Grey's Mediacom Worldwide (off line) and Media.com (on line). A mainstream campaign from Grey Advertising is due early next year. **********If executives at Autobytel.com are, as Ms. Benvenuto put it, ''maverick marketers,'' the choice of Grey Advertising is at odds with the old perceptions that the agency's creative output was as colorless as its name. **********''Creative is very important,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, ''and Grey has strong creative.

In his original concept, there would be computers without disk drives that would largely be used to access networks \u2014 including the Internet. Such machines would cost about $600, less than half the price of standard desktop units at the time. **********But as prices for full-fledged computers have fallen below $1,000, the attraction of network computers has diminished, though even smaller handheld devices are being used to access the Internet, and electronic commerce is growing at a phenomenal rate. **********So Mr. Ellison was correct in his view that interest in network computing would grow. When people use Internet services through personal computers or other devices, they are essentially allowing the processing to be done by network servers, where Oracle's products are likely to be found. The company says that the 10 most popular consumer Web sites and nine of the top 10 business-to-business sites are built atop its databases. **********Databases are programs that contain information that can be searched according to various criteria. **********Companies use databases for a variety of reasons, but one key area besides the Internet is as a base for enterprise software: huge integrated programs that run many facets of large businesses, from ordering supplies to scheduling workers. About a quarter of databases sold are used to support these enterprise resource planning programs, which are principally supplied by SAP AG, PeopleSoft Inc. and Baan Co. **********Microsoft is trying to increase its share of the market for database products that run on its Windows operating systems. Databases from Oracle and other competitors can run on Windows, Unix or other operating systems. **********At Comdex, Microsoft carried the battle to Oracle's home turf by choosing the show as a venue to introduce the newest version of its database program, SQL (called sequel) Server 7.0. **********Oracle, which had just announced an upgrade to its database, called Oracle 8i, was not about to let its rival make an unchallenged splash in its home market. **********\"We were delighted but surprised by their na\u00efvet\u00e9 at the show,\" said Mark Jarvis, Oracle's senior vice president for marketing. \"Did they really think we were going to let them come here and make a database announcement?\" **********While Microsoft is the larger company, Oracle is a far bigger player in the database market. It accounted for 39.3 percent of the $6.6 billion relational-database market last year, according to figures from Gartner Group/Dataquest. International Business Machines Corp. followed with 26.8 percent, while Microsoft had 7.4 percent. **********After Microsoft scheduled its announcements, Oracle responded by returning to Comdex following an absence of several years, and Mr. Ellison arranged to give a speech last Monday night, a day after Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, opened the show with a presentation and just hours after Microsoft announced SQL Server 7.0. Mr. Ellison spoke about Raw Iron, Oracle's latest attack on Microsoft's Windows juggernaut. **********For Oracle 8i, Mr. Ellison contended, the operating system is largely superfluous. Except for communicating with the computer's memory and network, he said, the Oracle database handles most of its operations autonomously, and the existence of a full-fledge operating system slows it down. So Big Iron is supposed to be a refrigerator-sized computer with just the few elements of an operating system necessary to support Oracle's database. **********Of course, a Big Iron computer could not run anything outside the Oracle database, but Mr. Ellison said that half the users of Oracle databases run them on dedicated servers anyway. Oracle 8i can support applications itself, including Web browsers and word processors. Indeed, so many programs could run inside Oracle 8i that you could look at it as an operating system, though Mr. Ellison was careful to say that Oracle was not getting into the operating-system business. **********Oracle is negotiating with several manufacturers to make Big Iron. The cost of the systems would be comparable to current servers with Oracle 8i. **********Mr. Ellison also used the occasion to trumpet what he saw as Oracle 8i's advantages over SQL Server. He offered $1 million to anybody who could make a specific research query on SQL run more than 1/100th the speed of the same process on Oracle 8i, which he said had run faster than its Microsoft competitor in every benchmark test ever done, an assertion that depends on your definition of what was being tested. **********He was particularly proud of a function that allowed Microsoft documents to be easily transferred into an Oracle database, where they could then be searched by different criteria. **********It is difficult to define which program is better. \"Both databases are good, depending on what you want to use them for,\" said Carolyn DiCenzo, principal analyst at Gartner Group/Dataquest. **********Oracle executives seemed surprised that Microsoft had not made concessions to network computing; Microsoft seemed surprised they were surprised. \"They missed the significance of the Internet,\" Mr. Jarvis said of Microsoft. \"All of their actions are distancing themselves away from the trends in the industry.\" **********Mr. Demas of Microsoft saw the opposite. \"Our belief is that PC servers running on Windows NT will be the way companies decide to go.\" **********Although Oracle executives gleefully predict that the Internet and the model of networking it inspires will make computer users around the world eager to abandon the tasks of server administration, the reality may be more complex. **********Patrick McGovern, chairman of the researcher and financial publisher International Data Group., said that many corporate departments would want to have control over their servers and their data. He predicted that about 65 percent of users would opt to retain the client/server architecture, while the rest would opt for the megaserver concept. **********\"The megaserver fights against the idea of autonomy,\" he said. **********Mr. Jarvis agreed with that. \"The only people who want control of the data are the users,\" he said. **********Not a populist, however, Mr. Jarvis said that chief executives and their top technology officers would want to control the information themselves, and that it made sense to centralize the power in a corporation with its leaders. **********- **********E-mail address: CyberScape@iht.com **********Recent technology articles: **********www.iht.com/IHT/TECH/"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/05/business/europe-official-cites-concern-on-worldcom-mci-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1998-06-05", "snippet": "Karel van Miert, top European regulator reviewing Worldcom Inc's proposed $37 billion acquisition of MCI Communications Corp, says MCI's proposed sale of its wholesale Internet unit to Cable and Wireless PLC might not allay his antitrust concerns;...", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Official Cites Concern On Worldcom-MCI Merger", "print_headline": "Europe Official Cites Concern On Worldcom-MCI Merger", "body_text": " **********The top European regulator reviewing Worldcom Inc.'s proposed $37 billion acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation said yesterday that MCI's proposed sale of part of its Internet business might not allay his antitrust concerns. **********MCI announced last week that it had agreed to sell its wholesale Internet unit to Cable and Wireless P.L.C. for $625 million in cash.

The United States' position is that such issues marginalize the significance of human rights, said Craig Kuehl, an American official who monitors the commission. **********''The question of illicit movement and dumping of toxic products and waste is a serious problem,'' he said, ''but the Commission on Human Rights is not the correct international forum.'' **********There is no doubt in Mrs. Ksentini's mind that dumping is a human rights violation. She said information she gathered shows ''serious violations of the right to life and health'' that in some cases ''had led to sickness, disorders, physical or mental disabilty and even death.'' **********Her report was a bit embarrassing: She named the United States, Germany, Australia, Britain and the Netherlands as the biggest toxic-waste exporters, and said masses of toxic waste are still being sent to Africa, while the bulk of European waste goes to the Baltic countries and to Eastern and Central Europe. Half of the United States exports went to Latin America; British exports go largely to Asia. **********Despite her lack of progress, developing countries are seeking to extend Mrs. Ksentini's mandate for three years. American officials have already prepared a recommendation limiting her to one more year.

Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, responding to questions from the studio audience and from CNN viewers. The text was provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company: **********Q:  The American Administration has the might and the means to attack the Iraqi state, but does it have the moral right to attack the Iraqi nation? [Cheers, applause.] **********MR. COHEN:  The question is also, does Saddam Hussein have the moral right to use weapons of mass destruction -- [Shouts from hecklers.] -- against his own people.  The United Nations has determined that he should not possess chemical or biological or nuclear weapons, and what we have is the obligation to carry out the U.N. declaration to make sure he doesn't pose a threat of the immoral magnitude to his neighbors has he has done in the past. [Applause.] **********Q:  This Administration has raised concerns about Iraq's threats to its neighbors, yet none of these neighbors seem to threatened. . . . Furthermore, the international community has been opposed to the bombings. If nobody's asking us for their help, how can you justify further U.S. aggression in the region? [Applause, shouts.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  It is very clear that the problem here is one to the region. Saddam Hussein has invaded another country before, he continues to try to develop weapons of mass destruction [Shouts from hecklers.] and I have been to the region. I have talked to the neighbors. They are concerned about what is going on there. They have made it very clear that they are worried about what Saddam Hussein is doing, and we are going to be a part of a coalition helping them to resolve this problem. . . . **********Q:  If push comes to shove and Saddam will not back down, will not allow or keep his word, are we ready and willing to send the troops in? [Cheers, applause.] **********MR. COHEN:  . . . I just returned from visiting our troops on the U.S.S. George Washington.  I visited our troops on the U.S.S. Independence. Each and every one of those young men and women who are out there are prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to contain the threat. **********What we are seeking to do is not to topple Saddam Hussein, not to destroy his country, but to do what the United Nations has said in its declarations. And we want to insist that it's not only words, but deeds. We want the enforcement of the U.N. declarations. And these young men and women are prepared to carry out that mission. We do not see the need to carry out a large land campaign in order to try to topple Saddam Hussein. Our mission is to get the inspectors back; if they can't get back, to make sure that he can't constitute or reconstitute this threat. **********Q:  President Carter . . . was quoted yesterday as saying that up to 100,000 innocent Iraqi civilians could be killed. Is that something, Secretary Albright, [Shouts, applause.] that you think is a realistic possibility? **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  First of all, let me just say the following thing: I am willing to make a bet to anyone here that we care more about the Iraqi people than Saddam Hussein does.  [Applause.] He has, for the last seven years since the gulf war, he has starved his people.  We have provided food. There is no limit on the amount of humanitarian assistance that can go in. . . . So the point here is that he does not care a fig about his people, and if he does the totally uncivilized thing of putting women and children to guard his regime, then the fault is his. **********Q: Why do you think the other members of the Security Council have been reluctant to support the military action, other than Great Britain? **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  Let me first of all say that what is very important to know, that every Security Council resolution has been supported by members of the Security Council, which is to get full implementation of these resolutions that call on Saddam Hussein to allow the inspection and verification to make sure that these weapons of mass destruction are gone. **********We have great support from members of the United Nations and the Security Council.  They, as we, would prefer a peaceful solution to this, as we have said. And we are supporting and we've said that we agree that Kofi Annan should go on this trip to Baghdad. And I believe that we do have the support for what we need to do because we are fulfilling the Security Council resolutions. **********Q:  I would like to ask Mr. Secretary (Cohen) if he thinks that the ultimate goal of this particular action, which the United States may or may not take, should be the ultimate removal of Saddam Hussein from Government, because it is obvious that, as Secretary Albright has mentioned, he is a repeat offender. . . . **********MR. COHEN:  Thank you for the question. I think the difference is -- that exists between what is desirable and what is do-able. I think everyone in that region as well as the world community would welcome Saddam Hussein's removal from power. We would welcome the opportunity, as Secretary Albright has said, to deal with another regime and, hopefully, have a much more positive and productive relationship. **********But what is do-able remains another question all together, as Mr. Berger pointed out.  This would require, in our judgment, a rather massive force of land forces, and we don't think that it's necessary in order to contain him. We think that we can contain him, as we have for the past seven years, and allow the Iraqi people at some point in time to determine for themselves whether they want another seven years of deprivation. **********Q:  Assuming that the United States does do air strikes on Iraq, I was wondering what the United States is prepared to do if Iraq decides to retaliate by attacking its neighbors. **********MR. COHEN:  We have, obviously, taken that into account. We have planned for virtually every contingency. Should Saddam Hussein seek to strike out against his neighbors, we have prepared defensive measures. . . . And we would respond rather swiftly also should he attack his neighbors. So we have been coordinating very closely with all of the countries in the region. **********Q:  Since we are unsure where Iraq's weapons are, how can we direct a bombing strike against them? **********MR. COHEN:  We have carefully selected the targets that will be necessary in order to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors or to deliver weapons of mass destruction.  We have reasonably, I would say, very good evidence in terms of intelligence where these systems are, in fact, produced as far as the delivery systems. We have a good set of options available for us should it become necessary. So we are confident that we will be able to diminish his capacity to reconstitute these systems and to deliver them, and that will be our goal. **********Q: There are news media reports that Iraq has moved much of their weapon industry to other countries. Would we consider targeting them in other countries? **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  First of all, . . . we have no indication that this is taking place. What we are concerned about is Saddam Hussein, who has a record of using weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors as well as against his own people. And a brutal dictator who is terrifying his people and threatening the region. And our policy is to contain him; that is what we are trying to do. **********Q: Why bomb Iraq, when other countries have committed similar violations? . . . For example, Turkey has bombed Kurdish citizens. Saudi Arabia has tortured political and religious dissidents. Why does the U.S. apply different standards of justice to these countries? [Cheers, applause.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  Let me say that when there are problems such as you have described, we point them out and make very clear our opposition to them. But there is no one that has done to his people or to his neighbors what Saddam Hussein has done . . . [Hecklers shouting.] **********Q.  What about Indonesia? Well, you've turned my microphone off. **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  I think that the record will show that Saddam Hussein has produced weapons of mass destruction, which he's clearly not collecting for his own personal pleasure but in order to use. [Hecklers shouting.] And therefore, he is qualitatively and quantitatively different from every brutal dictator that has appeared recently. And we are very concerned about him specifically and what his plans might be. **********Q: What I am saying is that there needs to be consistent application of U.S. foreign policy.  [Applause, cheers.] We cannot support people who are committing the same violations because they are political allies. That is not acceptable. We cannot violate U.N. resolutions when it is convenient to us. **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  We do not. . . .- **********Q. You're not answering my question, Madame Albright. [Cheers, applause.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  I suggest, sir, that you study carefully what American foreign policy is, what we have said exactly about the cases that you have mentioned. Every one of them have been pointed out. Every one of them we have clearly stated our policy on. [Shouting begins again.] And if you would like, as a former professor, I would be delighted to spend 50 minutes with you describing exactly what we are doing on those subjects. [Applause.] **********Q:  There are many countries that have these biological and chemical weapons -- six countries in the Middle East alone. You've stated why Saddam Hussein should be singled out, but it is puzzling to people to wonder why it's O.K. for these other countries to have biological and chemical weapons. [Applause.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  I think that is clear that other countries have weapons of mass destruction. It is a question of whether there is a proclivity to use them. [Scattered applause.] And Saddam Hussein is a repeat offender. And I think it is very important for us to make clear that the United States and the civilized world cannot deal with somebody who is willing to use those weapons of mass destruction on his own people, not to speak of his neighbors. [Applause, heckling.] **********Q:  Missiles landed in Israel during the gulf war, yet at America's request Israel restrained itself from - was restrained from defending itself. What will our country's posture be this time, and how will Israel be expected to protect its citizens in the face of potential Iraqi aggression? [Applause.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  I have recently been to Israel, and there have been, obviously, discussions about this. Every country has a right to make its own decisions about how to protect itself, and we are consulting very closely with Israel. **********MR. COHEN:  I also have met with the Defense Minister, and we are satisfied that full cooperation will accommodate Israel's defensive needs as well. **********Q:  How do we convince the Russians that it's in their vital interest to support an international coalition against Saddam if push comes to shove? **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  Well, let me say, I have spent a great deal of time with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Primakov. He fully agrees with the fact that Saddam Hussein has to fulfill his obligations under the Security Council resolutions, and he has been working with all of us to try to get a peaceful solution. They are concerned about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and I believe that we should all be working on a peaceful solution. But if we can't, I am sure that we will all be together in the end. **********Q:  The U.S. has put a lot of time and effort into peace talks between Israel and Palestinian and the Middle Eastern countries. If we go into Iraq, how will this impact those peace talks, and do you perceive any type of backing away from the table if that happens? **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  . . . 1997 was not a great year for the peace talks. But we are determined to continue, and these are two very separate issues that need to be resolved. And we will spend the time that's necessary. I've been in touch with both the leaders there and others in recent days and weeks. And we will continue to press that, because that's an issue of great importance to the United States. **********Q:  Why doesn't the United States give military support to the democratic opposition in Iraq? And this brings up the whole question of why doesn't the United States give -- perhaps release frozen -- the Iraqis' billions of dollars in frozen assets and make it available to the democratic opposition in Iraq? **********MR. BERGER:  I think as Secretary Cohen has said, we have and we will continue to support the democratic opposition in Iraq. I think one has to be very careful, though.  This actually relates to the point that the previous caller was making. If you encourage and almost incite people to rise up against their government, you incur a moral obligation [Hecklers shouting.] to come to their defense at a moment of peril. And we have had experiences in this country, in the Bay of Pigs, in Hungary in 1956 and in Iraq in 1991, where perhaps our rhetoric has gone ahead of what we are prepared to do. And we've been very careful not to let that happen again. **********Q:  If there is no peaceful resolution to the problem and war is inevitable, and we end up damaging their country even further, are we, the American people, the tax-paying people, going to be responsible for making financial reparations to the country? [Hecklers shouting.] **********MR. BERGER:  You know, if I could just answer that, Saddam sits on enormous storehouses of oil. And as Secretary Albright said before, it's the United States since 1991 that has been trying to say to -- to give him the right to sell that oil, take that money, buy food and medicine for his people and distribute it under U.N. auspices so we make sure that it goes to people and not to tanks. For five years, he refused even to have such a regime. We finally got such a regime in place. He delayed it another six months.  We're now prepared to expand that regime.  We would like to see him sell more oil so that more food and medicine can get to the Iraqi people; and, believe it or not, he is resisting that. So I think it is -- our quarrel is certainly not with the Iraqi people. We would like to help them get the food, the medicine, the other things that they need for their daily lives. **********There's one obstacle standing in the way of that, and I think all of you know who that is. **********Q:  How can these people sleep at night? We are not going to be able to stop Saddam Hussein. We are not going to be able to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction -- all of them. President Clinton admitted it.  All he wants to do, Clinton said, was send a message to Saddam Hussein. If he wants to send a message, we, the people of Columbus and central Ohio and all over America will not send messages with the blood of Iraqi men, women, and children! If we want to deal with Saddam, we deal with Saddam, not the Iraqi people! [Cheers, applause, shouting.] **********MS. ALBRIGHT:  . . . Let me say that what we are doing is so that all of you can sleep night, because we are facing. [Applause, cheers] We are in a very different kind of a world [heckler continues shouting] where we are facing the danger of the spread of the weapons of mass destruction. We had an initial example of this, as Secretary Cohen said, in Tokyo, and we need to really put a stop to dictators who have weapons of mass destruction and threaten to use them against their people. . . . **********MR. BERGER:  Part of what we fight for as a country is the freedom to argue. And I appreciate all of you coming. I appreciate most of you listening. We have certainly -- we have certainly listened to you -- at least those who we could understand. [Laughter.] And I think the fundamental point that I want to make here is two-fold; number one, we want to resolve this peacefully. But number two, there are some things worth fighting for and those include fighting aggression, fighting people who threaten their neighbors, and fighting to make this world a safer and more secure place for my children and for yours. [Applause, shouts from hecklers.] Thank you. **********MR. COHEN:  If I could just indicate to the audience this really is a tremendous example of what democracy is all about, the people who are here expressing opposition and criticism would not be allowed to do that in a number of countries, including Iraq.  [Cheers, applause.] . . . **********Let me say, as Secretary of Defense, it is my obligation not only to try and identify those problems that confront us today, but those challenges of tomorrow. Most of you here have children and will be building families in the future, and we have a choice to make. There's an old expression that you can pay me now or pay me later. With respect to Saddam Hussein, we can deal with him now, or our children and grandchildren will have to deal with the spread of chemical and biological weapons later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/26/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-02-26", "snippet": "US dollar's volatility against German mark continues; dollar jumps .0212 percent, to finish at 1.8188; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********DOLLAR JUMPS.

But the biggest move involves sales of Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system, Windows NT, which is becoming more and more popular in corporate America. **********''Microsoft and especially Windows NT are just taking over the desktop in the Federal Government,'' said Robert Dornan, senior vice president of Federal Sources Inc., a research firm in McLean, Va. ''And I don't see anything on the horizon that would undermine its success.'' **********To be sure, the spectacle of Washington's beating Microsoft with one hand while buying from it with the other is not as glaringly contradictory as it might seem. The antitrust confrontation with Microsoft, the Justice Department insists, is not intended to hobble the company but to protect competition and innovation in the software industry. **********The focus of the investigation, as the department considers filing a major antitrust case against Microsoft, is on accusations that the company is using its near-monopoly in the market for personal computer operating-system software to gain an unfair advantage in the new markets of Internet software, new media and on-line commerce. **********But if Microsoft succeeds not through unfair advantages but by offering the best product for the best price, then modern antitrust policy is working as it should. ''That's right,'' a senior Justice Department official said on condition that he not be identified by name, because ''I certainly don't want to throw them a bouquet.'' **********Feeling embattled these days, Microsoft is uncharacteristically touchy about the success of its Government business. An executive in its Washington office observed, ''Now remember, we lose sales, too'' -- not exactly the take-no-prisoners ethos long espoused by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, or Steven Ballmer, the executive vice president in charge of sales. **********Microsoft started its Government business in 1986 with a one-person office in Washington. Today, the company has 120 people in its Federal systems unit, about 20 more than a year ago. Given the Justice Department's antitrust investigation, and all the resulting public attention, the Microsoft staff refers jokingly to the Washington office as ''ground zero.'' **********Still, the Washington business is thriving. The company does not disclose its Government sales. But industry analysts estimate that in the current fiscal year, ending in June, its Government sales will be about $380 million, up nearly 40 percent from the previous year. **********The far higher sales will probably come over the next several years as large installations of Microsoft software gain momentum -- especially for Windows NT, which is typically used for big networks of PC work stations. **********The Social Security Administration, for example, began a program last year to install 70,000 Windows NT work stations, running off 5,000 Windows NT network server computers, by 2003. **********And the United States Postal Service is replacing its 80,000 point-of-sale terminals nationwide with Windows NT work stations. **********''These Government customers are very big, so when they make a decision, the rollouts can be huge,'' said Pete Hayes, general manager of Microsoft's Federal systems business. **********To the Government, the appeal of Microsoft products is the potential cost saving and the ease of using its industry-standard programs. In many cases, Windows NT systems are replacing systems that use the Unix operating system, initially developed for scientific and research purposes. With the steady improvement in PC performance, personal computers can match the performance of Unix work stations at perhaps half the price or less, by some estimates. **********Once a technology laggard, the Government ''is leading the charge on NT in some ways, pushing it into more advanced uses that you see in most corporations,'' said Mathew Mahoney, an analyst for IDC Government, a research service in Falls Church, Va. **********The Air Force is an example of that. In a pilot program, it is beginning to experiment with moving some of its vital command-and-control operations -- which range from mapping battlefields to spotting enemy fighter jets -- away from bigger, more costly computers onto personal computers running Windows NT. **********''People in the industry say that Windows NT can take over these applications at far less cost,'' said Col. Richard Picanso, director of the command-and-control computer systems at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass. ''We want to see how much of that is marketing hype and how much of that is real.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/08/world/between-two-west-coast-cities-a-duel-to-the-last-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Brian Alexander", "pub_date": "1998-12-08", "snippet": "Brian Alexander article on battle between San Diego and Los Angeles over San Diego's effort to buy water from Imperial Irrigation District, largest user of Colorado River; map (M)", "word_count": 1386, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Between Two West Coast Cities, a Duel to the Last Drop", "print_headline": "Between Two West Coast Cities, a Duel to the Last Drop", "body_text": " **********IF Pirandello had written a play about water, he might have set it in a place where the London Bridge looms in one of the driest deserts on earth, where a $250-million water plant was built to desalt a supposedly freshwater river, and where huge pipes, like giant silver straws, rush water to gleaming cities hundreds of miles away. **********In other words, Pirandello might have set his play near the Colorado River, where fights over water have provided a real-life theater of the absurd for years. States, cities and agricultural districts are trapped in this world through a Byzantine set of agreements, court decisions and legislation known as the law of the river, which has been hammered out, sometimes after guns were drawn, over the last 75 years. Today, it is difficult to find anyone in the seven states governed by the law who thinks it is fair or that it reflects late-20th-century reality. At the same time, no one is willing to toss it out and start over. **********''I do not think it is the work of our generation to try to revisit this river constitution'' is how Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt puts it. **********Rather than changing the water rights outlined by the law of the river, Mr. Babbitt favors allowing those areas with water rights to sell, lease or trade them to those that want or need more. Such markets, his argument goes, will help water, which is often artificially cheap, find its true price and will encourage conservation. **********The Secretary may be right, but when the city of San Diego put that notion to the test, a nasty, two-year feud with Los Angeles ensued. It is a quarrel that could serve as an object lesson in the kind of paranoia, civic posturing and heated rhetoric that frequently accompanies water disputes in this part of the country. **********The feud began as a straightforward deal. San Diego wanted water -- more precisely, it wanted control of its source of water. The Imperial Irrigation District in the Imperial Valley, the largest user of the Colorado River, had so much water that it was apparently wasting it. So, in 1996, the two agreed that San Diego would buy water from Imperial, and Imperial would spend the money on conservation measures. It looked like a win-win arrangement -- but when it comes to Colorado River water, there is no such thing as win-win. **********San Diego has long felt it has lived in the shadow of the larger metropolis to the north, Los Angeles. When it comes to water, that perception is accurate. Though San Diego considered taking its own supply of Colorado River water over the mountains years ago, fate interceded in 1941 when the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District of Southern California finished its aqueduct, which is about 240 miles from the river. **********At the instigation of the United States Navy, which was anchoring a major part of its fleet here, San Diego joined Metropolitan as a member in 1946. Today, with 27 members, the state-chartered Metropolitan is the largest supplier of water in the United States, serving about 16 million people in six Southern California counties. San Diego, which imports up to 95 percent of its water, is by far the biggest customer. **********This has not made allies of the two cities. For one, votes on Metropolitan's board are weighted in favor of Los Angeles, which has an independent water supply from the Owens Valley in the Sierra Nevada foothills hundreds of miles north of the city, and does not use its full allocation of Metropolitan water. Therefore, Metropolitan has been able to sell the water to other users, which has kept the district's coffers full and has expanded both its system and its power. San Diegans, whose city has grown on borrowed water, have known that in the event of a shortage, Los Angeles could cut the flow. **********''In the chamber of commerce in Los Angeles, they would tell C.E.O.'s looking to locate in Southern California that even though San Diego is a nice place, they do not have any water,'' said Joseph Parker, the incoming chairman of the San Diego County Water Authority. (He starts on Jan. 1.) **********The Los Angeles chamber of commerce denies this, and representatives of the Metropolitan District point out that the agency has never cut off San Diego's supply. David S. Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, calls San Diego's concern ''a red herring to rally the troops around.'' **********In 1991, however, which was a drought year, Metropolitan came very close to causing a virtual shutdown of San Diego's economy when it announced that the city's water supply would be cut in half. Fortunately for San Diego, a series of rains ended the threat. **********But after that, San Diego sought a source of water it could control and found it on the desert farms of the Imperial Valley, in the southeast corner of California. The Imperial district agreed to sell water to San Diego for $233 an acre-foot (about 360,000 gallons, or enough to cover one acre to a depth of one foot), not a bad markup on water for which Imperial pays the Federal Government an administration fee of 25 cents an acre-foot. It was also a good deal for San Diego, which pays Metropolitan $349 an acre-foot. **********The agreement was applauded by the seven Colorado River states (besides California, these are Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming) and by Mr. Babbitt's office. But Metropolitan was furious. Along with the other desert irrigation districts that tap the Colorado, its board thought it had a right to any water saved by Imperial. And if San Diego stopped buying so much water from Metropolitan, it would mean a loss of income. **********So, Metropolitan unleashed a legal and public relations blitz. It advised local black civic leaders that Mr. Parker, who is African-American and was then the vice-chairman, was being passed over for the chairmanship of the San Diego authority. Metropolitan, which regarded Mr. Parker as more conciliatory than Christine Frahm, the outgoing San Diego water chairwoman, ''wanted to make a big racial issue out of it,'' Mr. Parker said. **********Metropolitan also had a more direct card to play, since the water was not going to be physically shipped from the Imperial Valley to San Diego, but instead would be flowing from the Colorado -- through Metropolitan's pipes. So the agency tried to impose a charge for transporting the water to San  Diego that would turn the deal into a money loser. A state court judge threw out the plan. **********Such tactics led to an investigation -- still going on -- by the state legislature. Metropolitan's chief of operations, Jay Malinowski, said that while ''some cheap shots were taken at Metropolitan, it is undeniable the district's reputation was damaged'' by its strategy. On Aug. 12, it agreed to deliver the Imperial water to San Diego. **********Mr. Babbitt calls the San Diego-Imperial arrangement a major achievement, but cautions that the deal is not done. The Coachella Irrigation District, next to Imperial, has threatened to sue to stop it, arguing that it should receive water that Imperial does not use.

Despite that ban, the C.I.A. failed to tell Congress about allegations it had received against at least eight individuals with contra ties. **********During the time the ban on funds was in effect, the C.I.A. informed Congress about drug charges against only two other contra-related people. **********In addition, the agency failed to tell other executive branch agencies, including the Justice Department, about allegations against 11 contra-related individuals or entities. **********The report quotes many active and retired C.I.A. officers who served in Central America as saying they either did not hear or did not believe allegations of drug trafficking involving the contra rebels, with whom they worked closely. It also makes clear that the agency did little or nothing to investigate most of the drug allegations that it heard about the contras and their supporters. **********In April 1987, the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, wrote in a memorandum that it was ''absolutely imperative that this agency and our operations in Central America avoid any kind of involvement with individuals or companies that are even suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.'' **********The C.I.A. investigation that began almost a decade later, however, found no evidence that the memorandum was distributed to anyone other than Mr. Gates's deputy for operations, Clair George. **********The new study is the second volume of the C.I.A.'s internal investigation prompted by a 1996 series of articles in The San Jose Mercury-News, which claimed that a ''dark alliance'' between the C.I.A., the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with millions of dollars in profits from drug smuggling. The series also alleged that this network was the first to introduce crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles. The first volume of the C.I.A. inspector general's report, issued in January, dealt primarily with the specific allegations raised by the Mercury-News series and dismissed its central findings. **********The second volume is the result of a broader inquiry into long-unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking. **********In all, the report found that the C.I.A. received allegations of drug involvement by 58 contras or others linked to the contra program, including 14 pilots and two others tied to the contra program's C.I.A.-backed air transportation operations. **********The report indicates that information linking the contras to drugs began to emerge almost as soon as the contras came into existence, and before it became publicly known that the C.I.A. was supporting their effort to overthrow the Marxist-led Government in Managua."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/10/business/debt-issues-scheduled-to-be-offered-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 488, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debt Issues Scheduled to Be Offered This Week", "print_headline": "Debt Issues Scheduled to Be Offered This Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financings this week offers today's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills and the Treasury's quarterly refunding, involving five- and 10-year notes and a 30-year bond.

Oreck promotes these products heavily on radio and television, on fliers accompanying credit-card bills and in such mass-market publications as Parade magazine. **********But the prices of these marvels are not divulged: The potential buyer must mail or phone a request for an ''information kit'' to learn them. **********A consumer may also be frustrated when banks post or orally quote mortgage rates but refuse to actually make agreements on these terms until he plunks down cash to ''lock in,'' typically hundreds of dollars. **********''This sure discourages comparison-shopping,'' contended Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, which has mounted a campaign against the practice. **********Then there is America Online, which was luring new subscribers with offers of free time but without specifying the costs at the end of the trial period. The company agreed this spring to explain its charges more clearly as part of a broad settlement with 44 state attorneys general. **********Except in financial services, there are few laws or regulations requiring sellers to disclose prices to prospective buyers, whether the item in question is a house or car -- both usually subject to negotiation anyway -- a box of cereal or even the product widely considered to serve as the economy's most visible barometer, a gallon of gasoline. For the most part, the Government just polices advertising to keep it from being false or misleading. **********''Our interest gets piqued if it's a way to restrain competition or if there's consumer deception involved,'' said Willard K. Tom, deputy director of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission. (In a recently settled case over competition issues, the F.T.C. had contended that a group of farm-equipment dealers in Kentucky and Indiana had withheld advertisements from an industry journal after it published ads by other dealers featuring prices lower than those offered by the group members. The F.T.C. had also contended that the journal later agreed to stop accepting ads that included prices.) **********One obvious reason that consumers are often left to guess at prices is that manufacturers and retailers know that general American prosperity has reduced the need for many people to watch how they spend each nickel and dime. **********But there is more to it than that, marketing and advertising specialists say. Generally speaking, marketers say they are finding an emphasis on price to be a poor, often self-defeating strategy. It tends to erode consumer perceptions of product quality, and also eventually loses impact even with shoppers whose primary consideration is price. That's because the bargain-hunters wait to buy only during the inevitable sales. **********The notion of buying goods at sale prices ''becomes an entitlement,'' said Tom Lawson, managing partner at Arnold Communications, an advertising agency in Boston. **********Just as important, others say, is a desire not to unnecessarily intensify competition. **********''Marketers aren't pushing prices because they don't want to get into wars,'' said Audrey Guskey, professor of marketing at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. And manufacturers see little to gain by parading before Wall Street their current inability to raise prices in a minimum-inflation climate. **********Asked about his strategy of deferred price disclosure, David Oreck, the chief executive of the vacuum cleaner company, said it was a matter of practicality. ''We have several different models and there's just so much you can say in an ad,'' he said. **********Perhaps, the specialists suggested, the Oreck strategy is to concentrate on prospects who are motivated enough to request price information, at the risk of losing some potential customers who assume that Oreck cleaners are priced beyond their means. The products, which Mr. Oreck calls ''kind of mid-range,'' average $300 to $400. **********It is clear, though, that the rapid proliferation of Internet technology has complicated marketing strategies. ''A whole new source has emerged for price information that wasn't there before,'' said Joseph Plummer, director of brand strategy at McCann-Erickson Worldwide. **********Some sellers, though, avoid electronic commerce ''for fear that people would go on the Internet and comparison-shop,'' perhaps unfairly penalizing goods that should command premium prices, said Frank Torres, a spokesman for Consumers Union. **********YET according to a study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College of Business, consumer sensitivity to price ''tends to be lower on line'' than in stores, particularly when the sales pitch describes a product's other attributes, like nutritional value of a food product. **********In some cases, of course, the lack of a price tag is pure snob appeal, its absence intended to suggest that the product ''is for the kind of people who don't have to worry about the price,'' said Diane Cook-Tench, director of the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University. **********Or, as has been said about yachts, if you have to ask what one costs, you can't afford it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/02/business/international-briefs-indonesia-pumping-aid-funds-into-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Indonesia Pumping Aid Funds Into Banks", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Indonesia Pumping Aid Funds Into Banks", "body_text": " **********Bank Indonesia, the central bank, said yesterday that it had injected 83.5 trillion rupiah ($7.4 billion) into banks swamped by depositor withdrawals and bad debt since the nation's economic crisis began 10 months ago.

Consulting a Muslim prayer schedule and a digital watch, he held a cigarette lighter to the fuse at precisely 5:04 P.M., the time of the sunset prayer. **********The rocket shot into the sky and burst with a thunderous boom over the city, signaling the end of the daytime fast. The Muslim call to prayer began echoing from minarets as families sat down to their festive meal after sundown. **********For nearly 80 years, Mr. Sandouka says, his family has fired the cannon on Ramadan in Jerusalem, following a longstanding Muslim custom. **********But on this Ramadan as well as the last, the Jerusalem gun has fallen silent, replaced by fireworks in another twist of the conflict here between Arab and Jew. **********Mr. Sandouka says the Israeli authorities, jittery after a string of suicide bombings by Muslim militants in the Jewish side of Jerusalem, have denied him the gunpowder needed to fire the cannon. **********Israeli officials assert that Mr. Sandouka has only himself to blame, because he has failed to obtain the gunpowder he needs. **********''For the people of Jerusalem, the cannon is a historical tradition,'' Mr. Sandouka said. ''Now the heritage of the cannon has been lost.'' **********A 36-year-old actor and puppeteer who is not religiously observant, Mr. Sandouka takes his daily firing ritual seriously, shooting twice more at dawn to signal the start of the daylight fast. The dawn-to-dusk ban on eating, drinking and smoking lasts the entire holy month, which began on Dec. 30 and ends on Jan. 28. **********''This is a religious responsibility,'' Mr. Sandouka said of his task, noting that neither rain nor snow have kept him from his appointed rounds. On Monday, when a rare snowstorm struck Jerusalem, he showed up like clockwork at the cemetery, braving the elements to send off the morning shots. **********But his work has been severely restricted over the years by Israeli security requirements. When he used gunpowder -- packing it in to the gun-barrel with old rags and a pole as he had been taught by his father -- the use of the explosives was strictly monitored by the Israelis. **********A special permit was required to transport the gunpowder from a factory in the West Bank town of Ramallah, along a predetermined route to the East Jerusalem cemetery. Police officers would arrive at the graveyard periodically to check the amount of explosives and to make sure they were used entirely for the cannon. On one surprise visit the officers hid, phantom-like, among the graves, Mr. Sandouka recalled. **********Now the Jerusalem Municipality pays for fireworks provided by an Israeli supplier, and Mr. Sandouka sets them off with a permit from the authorities. He must call the Jerusalem police daily to serve notice when he plans to shoot. **********The Israeli Ministry of Labor, which issues permits for civilian use of explosives, says Mr. Sandouka is free to use gunpowder again, with a permit, if he finds a supplier. The Ramallah gunpowder factory closed down about two years ago. **********Mr. Sandouka asserts that as a law-abiding Palestinian with a clean security record, he has no alternative source of explosives, and that it is up to the Israelis to provide him with gunpowder he can use. **********Yitzhak Lisinger, the Labor Ministry's regional supervisor in Jerusalem, said that he didn't see the difference between shooting fireworks and firing the cannon. ''It's the same result: noise,'' he said. ''The effect is the same.'' **********But for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the Ramadan gun has become a symbol of the holy month, and fireworks are only a faint echo of the real thing. **********''It was better in the old days,'' said Azmi Muslih, a toy-shop owner who times his family's evening meal to the sound of the explosion. ''The children don't start eating until they hear the shot.'' **********Mr. Sandouka, who gets a symbolic fee of $4.30 a day from the municipality for his troubles, says that although the fireworks are a ''Western-style celebration'' quite different from the traditional Ramadan gun, he still feels the burden of public service on his shoulders. **********''It's our responsibility,'' he said of his family's duty. ''If I fail to do it once, people stop me in the street the next day and ask, 'Why didn't you fire the cannon?' People break their fast when they hear the gun.'' **********As he prepared to set off the fireworks this evening, Mr. Sandouka stared at his digital watch, which was synchronized to an Arabic radio broadcast that announced the moment of sunset prayer. **********''O fasters, the sun is now setting in the skies of Jerusalem,'' the radio announcer said. ''We say to the prayer-caller, send out your call!'' **********As the rocket burst overhead, the wailing calls to prayer began: ''God is great!''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/business/company-news-home-depot-to-buy-molson-s-25-stake-in-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-04-30", "snippet": "Home Depot Inc agrees to buy Molson Companies' 25 percent stake in their retail joint venture for $262 million, giving it complete ownership of home-improvement chain in Canada (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOME DEPOT TO BUY MOLSON'S 25% STAKE IN CHAIN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HOME DEPOT TO BUY MOLSON'S 25% STAKE IN CHAIN", "body_text": " **********Home Depot Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the Molson Companies' 25 percent stake in their retail joint venture for $262 million, giving it complete ownership of the home-improvement chain in Canada.

But they said that when Agriculture Department inspectors found the beetles boring through maple trees in suburban Chicago neighborhoods this summer, they felt compelled to act. **********''We are very concerned,'' Dr. Isi A. Siddiqui, Deputy Assistant Agriculture Secretary, said during the news conference. ''These new regulations are based on sound science and a real threat to U.S. environmental resources.'' **********Government studies estimated $138 billion of damage to the United States economy if the beetles, which have no natural enemies in the United States and cannot be eradicated with pesticides, move to United States forests. **********Dan Glickman, the Agriculture Secretary, said the action should not be seen as a trade sanction, adding that trade between the United States and China had grown to $80 billion this year from $5 billion 15 years ago. **********''Our intention here is not to disrupt trade, but to lock out an unwanted guest that poses a serious economic and environmental threat,'' Mr. Glickman told an audience in Chicago. **********The new regulations require that goods from China be packed in non-wood packing material or wood that has been treated with heat or fumigation to kill the insects. It was not clear whether Chinese exporters would be able to adopt new practices in the next 90 days or how much their costs would rise. **********Although the Chinese Government had no official comment on the ban, Chinese officials have been aware of the looming possibility for weeks and were hoping to avert it. **********''If the ban is imposed, China's exports will suffer, because a considerable amount of our export trade is packed in raw wood,'' one Agriculture Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. **********The Chinese Government has recently issued billions of dollars in Treasury bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy and insulate it against a slowdown caused by economic crises elsewhere in Asia or the summer's devastating floods in China. Although China's exports are still growing, the rate of growth has slowed this year, and a reduction of its thriving export sales to the United States would be hard to bear. **********Dr. Siddiqui said the United States Government had been discussing the problem with China's quarantine agency for many months, ever since the beetles were discovered in warehouses. He stressed that the United States hoped to cooperate with the Chinese to minimize disruption to trade. **********''Look, this is not an action we wanted to take, but this bug is eating trees in people's back yards and their front yards,'' said one United States official in Beijing. ''Inspectors from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service are knocking on doors and saying, 'We have to cut down all the trees around your home.' '' **********In the United States, the beetles have so far been detected in wood packing from China in warehouses in 14 states. They have been found free in the environment in and around Chicago as well as in Brooklyn and Amityville, N.Y. **********The beetle was identified as the Asian long-horned beetle by a Cornell University entomologist, Richard Hoebeke, after Brooklyn residents noticed mysterious half-inch holes in their trees. The beetle's larvae drill through trees' bark into the wood, where they undergo metamorphosis into large black beetles with bright white spots and long elegant antennas. **********In Brooklyn, as in three subsequent infestations, inspectors had to order the destruction of all affected trees, since there is currently no other way to control the pests. **********United States officials disagreed somewhat over just how much of China's exports were packed in untreated wood, with estimates ranging from 25 percent to more than 90 percent, and on how difficult it would be for Chinese to adjust to the new requirements. **********Ma Zhongmei, an official at the export department of the North China Air Transportation Company in Beijing, said about one-third of her company's customers packed goods in raw wood. She added that this sort of packing was most commonly used for high-value items, like large machines and factory equipment. **********''These customers could have used plywood, but they chose raw wood to reduce cost,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-case-where-fine-lines-blur.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1998-05-19", "snippet": "Analysis of Justice Department's carefully honed antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp, which is likely to be watershed in setting ground rules of competition in digital age and guidelines for Government intervention in high-technology economy; Go...", "word_count": 1110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Where Fine Lines Blur", "print_headline": "U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE CASE; Where Fine Lines Blur", "body_text": " **********The Government explained its landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation today as a principled defense of the time-tested, bedrock values of capitalism, protecting consumer choice and economic competition from the predatory assault of a modern monopolist. **********Standing before a battery of television cameras and lights, Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, described the case at times in business-as-usual terms. The principles, he insisted, were clear-cut; the remedies asked of the court were limited, and the theories behind the case were standard antitrust doctrine. **********The Government's suit is aggressive in that it seeks to apply the Sherman Antitrust Act, enacted before the turn of the century, to millennium technologies. Even so, said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former senior Justice Department official, it asks the court to take more of a next step than a giant leap in jurisprudence. ''The suit is carefully crafted to push the law a little perhaps,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''but not so much that a court is being asked to embrace sweeping new theories about how antitrust applies to the software industry.'' **********Though carefully honed, the Microsoft case -- whatever the outcome -- seems certain to be a watershed in setting the ground rules of competition in the digital age as well as the guidelines for Government intervention in a high-technology economy. **********The Government sees the Microsoft case as a crucial test of how antitrust enforcement can be applied swiftly and ''surgically,'' in Mr. Klein's words, to protect innovation and competition in the fast-paced business of computer software. **********The Microsoft camp replies not only that it is innocent, but that the Government fundamentally misunderstands the facts of economic life in its industry -- and thus is running a grave risk of hobbling a dynamic part of the economy. **********Yes, the company says, competitors may suffer from its business practices, such as bundling software for browsing the Internet into its Windows operating system, but those practices also result in improved products that benefit consumers. **********The Government, Microsoft insists, is mistakenly bringing an industrial-era mind-set to a fluid, fast-moving field of the future. Microsoft's operating system, the central nervous system of a computer, has changed dramatically, adding dozens of new features over the years to make computers easier to use. All Windows' features, from point-and-click icons to software for sending faxes from a personal computer, were once sold as separate products. **********The line between what is in the operating system and what is a separate product, says William H. Gates, Microsoft's founder and chairman, changes every couple of years, and the borderline is elusive because it is all merely a collection of the electronic 1's and 0's of computer code. The software industry, Mr. Gates believes, is different. **********''This is a war between two competing philosophies,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior Justice Department official and the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ''It's very difficult to predict which philosophy is going to win.'' **********The legal battle, analysts predict, will more likely be blitzkrieg than the slow trench warfare of the last big antitrust case the Government brought in the computer industry -- the 13-year suit against I.B.M., which the Justice Department abandoned as technologically irrelevant in 1982. **********The Government's suit does not try to block the shipment of Microsoft's next-generation operating system, Windows 98, which the company released to computer manufacturers today and which is to reach store shelves in June. **********But to try to level the current competitive field, while it pursues its antitrust suit, the Government filed a request for a preliminary injunction. **********In seeking the injunction, the Justice Department is asking a United States district judge to require Microsoft to either remove its Internet Explorer browser from Windows, or include the browser of its main rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation. (The states' suit asks that Microsoft be forced to include a third Web browser of its choice unless Internet Explorer is removed.) **********The proposed injunction also seeks new freedom for personal computer makers by giving them the right to install their own main screen that consumers see first when they turn on their computers. Today, Microsoft has control over the main screen -- which is important because it is viewed as a gateway from which people gain access to Internet shopping, news and entertainment. **********Tactically, legal experts say, the preliminary-injunction phase of the confrontation may well decide the Microsoft case. A ruling on the Justice Department's request for an injunction will likely be made in six weeks or so. If the Government wins, it is not expected to require a product recall of Windows 98, since the remedies involve allowing PC makers to remove or alter its software. **********Whichever side wins, the other side is sure to appeal -- with an appellate verdict likely to come within six months. At that point, experts say, the fast-moving nature of the software industry will surely shape the legal strategy, since six months is almost a product lifetime in software. Any forced product changes would be all but permanent, and if the Government is losing, the high  technology marketplace may have left its suit in the dust. **********''If Justice loses the preliminary injunction, time is on Microsoft's side,'' Mr. Litan of Brookings said. ''If Microsoft loses, the Government has the upper hand.'' **********The Justice Department's case, built around Mr. Klein's theory of a limited if essential role for antitrust intervention, inevitably raises the question of whether it goes far enough. Even if the Government wins its case, skeptics argue, a victory may well be toothless, doing little to loosen Microsoft's tight grip on computing. Indeed, some analysts say that anything short of a trust-busting-style breakup of Microsoft would likely have little effect. **********''The political support isn't there in this round, but if the Government is really going to create a competitive environment, it is eventually going to have to split up Microsoft as it did with Standard Oil,'' said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has worked for Microsoft rivals. **********When asked if he might consider more drastic measures in the future, Mr. Klein ruled nothing out. Yet he emphasized that the goal of the Government's actions was not to insure the success of Microsoft's competitors. The Government, Mr. Klein said, is merely trying to open the door to some innovative company that might become the next Microsoft, rather than hobble the incumbent. **********''Nothing we are doing here will or should prevent Microsoft from innovating or competing on the merits,'' Mr. Klein said. ''What cannot be tolerated -- and what antitrust laws forbid -- is the barrage of illegal, anticompetitive practices that Microsoft uses to destroy its rivals and to avoid competition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/07/world/british-to-allow-march-this-one-in-belfast.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1998-07-07", "snippet": "British Government gives permission for a Protestant parade past Catholic area in Belfast one day after banning another group from marching through a Catholic area of Portadown; says further ban would have inflamed passions among pro-British Prote...", "word_count": 994, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British to Allow March, This One in Belfast", "print_headline": "British to Allow March, This One in Belfast", "body_text": " **********A day after a Protestant Orange Order parade was blocked from marching through a Catholic neighborhood, the British Parades Commission reversed two earlier decisions today and gave permission for another Protestant march to parade past a Catholic area. **********The commission chairman, Alistair Graham, said that allowing the order to march past the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast next Monday should not be seen as a tradeoff to help balance the decision banning the march Sunday in the Drumcree area of Portadown. **********A further ban, he said, would have risked inflaming passions among pro-British Protestant loyalists who already feel aggrieved at what they see as the authorities' eagerness to placate the Catholics. **********''We cannot ignore the importance of perceptions in Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Graham said at a news conference, ''and there is now a clear emerging sense of deep hurt amongst loyalists, which arises from our decisions to reroute.'' **********''This is in danger of spilling over into a serious law-and-order situation which is harmful to both communities,'' he added. **********After two nights of sporadic violence over the Drumcree ban, however, many people here considered the decision an attempt to mollify the Protestants and a bid to head off possible new protests. **********Officials and experts said the decision was a weak, if not disingenuous, attempt to make the Government appear evenhanded, alternating permissions and denials to weaken opposition. In Ulster, pleasing one side usually outrages the other. **********The decison against the Drumcree Protestants produced Protestant violence; the decision in favor of the Protestants next Monday is also expected to produce demonstrations, this time by Catholics. **********A spokesman for residents of the Ormeau Road, John Gormley, said the Catholic community would challenge the commission's ruling in court, arguing that it had not met the legal guidelines set down for the Orange marches. **********The experts said the decision was unlikely to defuse the sitation at Drumcree, or end the fear that the violence endangers the peace effort. Many feel that the most optimistic scenario is that the inevitable public disorder in the next week will fade, permitting the new Northern Ireland Assembly to resume its work when it reconvenes in September. The least optimistic would be Protestant unionist members' resignation from the new assembly, which would vitiate the institution and raise the likelihood of resumed sectarian killing. **********The Belfast march, which has twice been banned by the commission in the last year, will be one of about 500 parades to celebrate the victory of the Protestant William of Orange over his Catholic father-in-law, King James II, at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. **********Most Catholics find the parades offensive and triumphalist. Protestants say they are a matter of freedom of assembly, a basic right. **********The province was calm today, but tonight Protestants in Belfast continued their violent reaction, the police said. Most of the incidents involved rioters throwing gasoline bombs at the police. There were no injuries. A police spokesman said at midnight, ''It's not as bad as last night, but the night is young.'' **********People worried about the effects of sustained violence on the peace effort, which nevertheless appeared to be moving ahead last week with the start of work by the new assembly. It is to enact the peace agreement approved in a referendum in May. **********''I'm afraid the violence will break up the whole thing,'' said Pauline Hegney, a Catholic mother of four, whose husband was shot dead seven years ago by Protestant paramilitary forces. ''I don't understand it,'' she added. ''Why should people want to march down streets where they have no supporters?'' Referring to a Protestant thoroughfare in West Belfast, she added, ''I wouldn't want to march down the Shankill.'' **********But Andy Wood, a political consultant and former information director for the British Government here, said of the violence: ''I don't think it puts the peace process in crisis. They are separate matters. But it shows just how deep the fault line runs in parts of Northern Ireland society.'' **********Police and political leaders appealed today for restraint, and for an end to the disorders caused by Protestants angry at the British Government's decision to deploy hundreds of combat-ready British troops and armed policemen to block the 191-year-old annual parade down a street in Drumcree, Portadown, 35 miles west of here. **********Several hundred Orangemen camped out overnight in Drumcree, sleeping in tents decorated with Union Jacks and vowing to stay until they received permission for their march. They said that they would remain peaceful, that the violent demonstrators were not Orangemen and that Orangemen were not provoking the violence. **********On Sunday night the Orangemen were regaled by the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Protestant leader known for his open anti-Catholicism and opposition to the peace effort and the assembly, which is to give Catholics more power. He did not advocate violence, but he promised the campers they would win. **********Their mood this morning was jovial as they posed for photographers and cameramen and answered reporters' questions. Two years ago, in a similar dispute at Drumcree, Protestants rioted for four days after the British Government banned the march. The riots forced the Government to reverse its decision and allow the march. The reversal in turn provoked Catholic rioting. **********Today the Drumcree Orangemen were saying that they would stay in the field until they got permission to march. **********Earlier, the protesters blocked dozens of roads, hijacked and burned cars and fought several batttles with the police. **********Rioters in a neighborhood near the Belfast city center threw flaming gasoline bombs at the police, who pushed the attackers back by firing plastic bullets. There was only one serious injury in the provincewide disturbances. An inspector's skull was fractured with a brickbat in Londonderry. **********But the Protestants stayed largely in their own neighborhoods; there were no serious clashes with Catholics. The police said the level of violence on Sunday night was much lower than it had been two years ago, during the last Drumcree crisis. **********Mr. Wood, the political consultant, said ''What we need is four or five days of the world's cheapest policeman -- rain.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/23/business/week-s-treasury-sales-include-2-year-note.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Week's Treasury Sales Include 2-Year Note", "print_headline": "Week's Treasury Sales Include 2-Year Note", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financings this week offers today's regular weekly auction of new three-  and six-month bills and the auction of a two-year note tomorrow. **********According to traders, at the close of the New York cash market on Friday the rate on the outstanding three month bill was 4.35 percent and the rate on the six-month issue 4.39 percent.

Fuhgeddaboutit. **********A stuffed animal with attitude, Furby has already been turned by marketing buzz and a media blitz into the hot toy of the Christmas season. It is generating out-the-door lines at any store bold enough to admit it has a few in stock. And most parents trying to satisfy the demands of a teary-eyed 9-year-old are going away disappointed. **********''We've never had Furby in our stores for more than 15 minutes,'' said Michael Glazer, chief executive of Kay-Bee Toys, the mall-based retail chain owned by the Consolidated Stores Corporation. The Furby frenzy even has him taking calls from lots of old friends trying to get their hands on the toy. ''I'm hearing from people that I haven't heard from in years,'' he said. **********Furby is one of the few sure-fire hits in what promises to be a good, but probably not great, toy shopping period from now through the end of the year. **********The expected blockbusters include Mattel's talking Bounce Around Tigger, whose chief redeeming social value is that it gyrates uncontrollably. Toys based on the television shows ''Blue's Clues'' and ''Teletubbies'' as well as those tied to the ''Rugrats'' show on Nickelodeon, with its movie tie-in this year, are also expected to be exceptionally popular. **********A product from the Lego Group that melds technology and tradition is in the mix of potential hot sellers. Lego is rushing to raise output of Lego Mindstorms, the next generation of its classic toy, which combines robotics with building blocks. **********And, of course, Barbie still rules. **********But Furby appears to be in a special class. Tiger Electronics, the unit of Hasbro that makes Furby, said it was on target to sell more than a million of the animated stuffed animals this year, double the number it had expected. The supply, however, is far less than the demand. **********Part of the appeal seems to be that, at $30, Furby is a relatively affordable product that is both snuggly and smart, said Roger Shiffman, president of Tiger. Furby has bug eyes, big ears and an annoying need for attention. It speaks an imaginary language called Furbish but eventually learns English. That is when it begins to act like an antsy 4-year-old, laughing when tickled, singing jingles and even sneezing in your face. ''It's a lot of toy for the money,'' Mr. Shiffman said. **********But can the short supply of Furbys and other popular playthings really be because children are all making out the same wish lists? Or could it be that toy makers are deliberately not making enough to stir up an even greater frenzy? **********The manufacturers say unexpected consumer interest, whipped up by the media and advertising, is to blame. It is not that different from what happened in the early 1980's with Cabbage Patch dolls and with Tickle Me Elmo two years ago after Rosie O'Donnell plugged it on her television talk show. **********Unlike those shortages, though, consumers willing to spend a lot more have an alternative this year: an on-line auction site, Ebay (www.ebay.com), has been selling Furbys for as much as triple the retail price. **********Still, for all the interest in a few hot products, toy companies are only expecting modest gains in sales this season. **********Toys ''R'' Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, has the most on the line. The company is struggling to remake itself after turning in consistently dismal financial results for much of the year. The problem? Shoppers have increasingly become frustrated with the mammoth and often chaotic stores. And many have simply driven past Toys ''R'' Us stores to do one-stop-shopping at Wal-Mart or Dayton Hudson's Target. **********To fight back, Toys ''R'' Us has cut costs, in part by paring inventory, which has meant smaller orders to manufacturers. Another problem across the industry is that many of the most promising items have been slow to hit the market this year. **********A decade ago, about 70 percent of the industry's revenues came from holiday selling. And while half of the business still comes in the critical fourth quarter, the industry has been aggressively trying to get people to buy more playthings during other times of the year. **********In the last couple of years the strategy has worked well, as companies sold Tickle Me Elmo, virtual pets, Beanie Babies and other top-selling toys all year long. Keeping consumers interested in toys in the summer and spring enables companies to more accurately gauge how their year is shaping up before heading into the holiday. That, in turn, allows them to adjust promotions and supplies at crunch time. **********But this year, perhaps because of difficulties among Asian suppliers suffering from financial stress, production has been slow, which has once again tightened the selling period. So that kink, along with some product shortages, may make for spotty industrywide sales. ''Up to this point we're really kind of break even,'' said Terri Bartlett, a spokeswoman for Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group. ''With the holiday season, we are expecting it to kind of pull us through.'' **********The industry expects to turn in a modest 2 percent sales gain over last year's revenue of $22.5 billion, according to the toy group. ''I think the season is going to end up looking good,'' Ms. Bartlett said. ''I don't know that it's going to surmount what we had to face from the rest of the year.'' **********The range of nifty products certainly helps. And the industry should benefit not only from the healthy economy but also from the fact that companies are increasingly coming out with toys that appeal to a wider age range and both genders. Typically toys grab the attention of boys or girls, but not both, and appeal to youngsters in a narrow age range. **********That is still mostly the case. The wildly popular dolls based on the ''Blue's Clues'' and ''Teletubbies'' television programs still appeal almost exclusively to very young children. And Mattel's timeless toy, G.I. Joe, is still mainly a boy's toy while its Barbie doll is still a girl's best friend. **********But many more toys are bridging the gaps, which lets toy companies draw from a larger group. Beanie Babies, still much in demand, appeal to girls from kindergarten to junior high school. Even their parents are sometimes shelling out as much as $1,000 to collect ''retired'' characters. And Lego says fathers are buying its updated building blocks for themselves as well as their children of both sexes. **********The new version also expands the appeal to older children, particularly boys, the company said. Lego Mindstorms allow users to build robots and vehicles that will move and follow commands programmed into a hand-held electronic brain. **********''Adding this technology to the product maintains its core value but makes the product more relevant for older kids,'' said John Dion, a spokesman for Lego. The appeal for adults? ''A lot of guys grew up loving Legos and now they are really into computers and this combines both their interests,'' Mr. Dion said. **********There are some drawbacks to this product, however. Some potential buyers may get sticker shock at the $200 price tag. It also requires a computer to program the nerve center that brings the toys to life. **********While product appeal may be changing as toys develop brains, purchasing patterns are also evolving. More people are shopping at discount stores these days, and those chains are expected once again to set off fierce price wars to lure even more parents away from traditional toy retailers. **********Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target ''are using toys to get people in their stores and these stores get so much traffic to begin with that Toys ''R'' Us is finding that hard to combat,'' said Gene Gilligan, executive editor of Playthings magazine, a toy industry publication. **********On-line toy sellers are trying to broaden their appeal as well, playing up the ease of point-and-click shopping. Etoys (www.etoys.com), an on-line toy seller, has taken a hit at large retail competitors with a new television advertising campaign that pokes fun at the frustrations of shopping in stores. **********''The first thing the commercials do is remind people that stores are not fun and then it reminds them that there is an alternative,'' said Toby Lenk, chief executive of Etoys, a unit of Idealab. **********Etoys also says it has an edge over traditional stores because in addition to the widely known toys, it offers specialty items that the big retailers do not bother to stock. This year, for example, Etoys has had a run on a brew-your-own root beer kit from a tiny company called Copernicus. Special items like this are ''selling neck and neck with the big guys,'' said Jane Saltzman, vice president of merchandising at Etoys. **********Some categories that remain flat are board games and action figures. And some of last year's hot sellers are also beginning to lose their luster. Virtual pets are a bit of a yawn this year, and youngsters finally seem to have grown weary of some of those wiggle-and-giggle toys. **********Enjoy the respite.

On average, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are usually about 1.5 percentage points higher than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. **********That gap could narrow as Treasury rates stabilize near historic lows and mortgage rates slip, Mr. Barr said. **********This year, new mortgages for home purchases and refinancings are expected to hit a record $1.4 trillion, said Brian Carey, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. **********After the Fed's move yesterday, Norwest Bank in Minneapolis cut its prime lending rate, and others were expected to follow. The prime rate is a benchmark for other consumer and corporate loans, like credit cards, auto loans and small-business loans. The prime rate, 8.5 percent at most banks, should fall by at least a quarter-point, analysts estimate. Banks may also cut the interest rates they pay on savings accounts and certificates of deposit. **********On average, savings accounts paid interest of about 2.17 percent in April, according to Bank Rate Monitor, a research firm in North Palm Beach, Fla., that reports savings account rates twice a year. One-year certificates of deposit at banks paid an average rate of 4.69 percent as of Monday. **********Consumers with such loans as adjustable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit tied to the prime rate could see the impact of lower rates within the next few months, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial research firm in Butler, N.J."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/business/company-news-fort-james-to-cut-2500-jobs-in-streamlining.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1998-02-04", "snippet": "Fort James Corp will eliminate 2,500 positions, or 8 percent of its work force, in effort to streamline its operations in North America and Europe (S)", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORT JAMES TO CUT 2,500 JOBS IN STREAMLINING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; FORT JAMES TO CUT 2,500 JOBS IN STREAMLINING", "body_text": " **********The Fort James Corporation, the paper and consumer-products maker, said yesterday that it would eliminate 2,500 positions, or 8 percent of its work force, in an effort to streamline its operations in North America and Europe.

Simply wanting to learn a little more about the Internet, he signed on two years ago with Geocities, a service that gives people free space to publish their own pages on the World Wide Web. **********Some people use their Geocities sites to show the world their children, their poetry or their model train collection. Mr. Brown built a tribute to Monty Python, the British television comedy troupe. **********His Web site started slowly, but Mr. Brown, 34, a grocery store merchandiser who lives in Bridgeport, Conn., kept adding Python memorabilia, sound clips, scripts and pictures. Soon the site took on a life of its own, and Geocities began promoting it as one its ''landmark'' pages. **********By June, when he had a falling-out with the service over a promotion effort, his site had attracted more than 100,000 visitors. **********Mr. Brown's experience exemplifies the paradox of Geocities: The service is attracting an impressive and growing number of members and visitors, yet as it moves toward a public stock offering, it is struggling to formulate a credible image as a viable business. **********The founder of Geocities, David Bohnett, says that the sheer scale of the service's operation and popularity would have been unimaginable when he  started experimenting with the Internet in 1994. As of June, more than two million members had created personal Web sites consisting of more than 15 million pages about nearly every imaginable topic. **********Organized into 40 virtual ''neighborhoods'' at www.geocities.com, these sites add up to the third-most-visited domain on the Web, attracting 14 million viewers in April, the most recent month for which figures are available. **********The audience for Geocities has been growing at twice the speed of the average Web site, according to Media Metrix, which measures traffic on the Internet. **********Now the company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is going public. The investment bankers promoting the initial public offering hope investors will be drawn to the potential of Geocities' vast audience and to the low overhead of publishing a site created by millions of volunteers. **********They also hope that investors will not be discouraged by financial statements that suggest only the weakest vital signs of a going concern. **********Of course, as the company begins its road show over the next few weeks, it will probably talk of many plans to build its audience, to sell more advertising and to extract fees from at least some members for certain services. **********But it is not clear whether the service can build its business without alienating its members. For example, it was a promotional effort known as a watermark that set off the feud with Mr. Brown. **********The watermark is a translucent image of the Geocities logo that hovers in the lower right hand corner of the pages of its members, like the  ''ghost'' logos that identify television channels. The watermark's purpose is to encourage people entering one Geocities site to try other sites on the service. **********But many Geocities members complained that the watermark made their pages load more slowly on visitors' browsers, cluttered their screens and obfuscated links. **********So using the very tools that Geocities had given them to build their Web sites, some members created anti-watermark pages, chat rooms and mailing lists. When Mr. Brown turned the front page of his Monty Python site black in protest, Geocities stopped featuring his page. Other members got wind of this and  turned his case into a rallying point for the anti-watermark campaign. **********The whole situation, Mr. Brown said, reminds him of Monty Python's infamous sketch in which a pet store patron tries to return a dead parrot. ''The customer has a valid complaint, and the management uses every trick available to avoid facing that fact,'' Mr. Brown said. **********Such are the promise and the peril that come with trying to build a business by giving a megaphone to millions of people. Geocities is one of a growing number of ''on-line communities'' -- sites or services that allow people to publish Web pages and communicate with one another by chatting, sending E-mail and so forth. Such community sites now make up 6 of the 20 most-popular sites on the Web. Geocities is the largest, followed in descending popularity by Tripod, Anglefire, Hotmail, Switchboard and Xoom. **********Some advertisers are wary of placing their product next to chat that as likely as not will turn sexual -- or on a page that today is an affable tribute to Monty Python and tomorrow is a diatribe against the host service. **********''What gives us a nervous twitch is the fear that if a user has a bad experience they will think negatively on our clients,'' said Jonathan Adams, a media buyer for Ogilvy One, the on-line agency for Ogilvy & Mather. ''Even if 99.9 percent of the sites are squeaky clean, it's that tenth of 1 percent that will wind up in the C.E.O.'s lap.'' **********Mr. Bohnett, who has championed the right to free expression of minorities as a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, says that playing censor in chief for two million people weighs heavily on him. **********''A lot of what I'm doing has to do with being gay and part of a minority that has not had an equal voice in society,'' Mr. Bohnett said in an interview in March. ''But we have to balance freedom of expression with commercial viability. Otherwise all of this will go away.'' **********Mr. Bohnett has declined to comment on the watermark or any other matter recently because Geocities is in a required ''quiet period'' related to its planned stock offering. In May, Mr. Bohnett hired Thomas R. Evans, the publisher of U.S. News & World Report, to be Geocities' chief executive. Mr. Bohnett remains chairman. **********The impulse that created Geocities was more expressive than commercial. In the spring of 1994, Mr. Bohnett took a break from a career in software marketing after his longtime companion died of AIDS. Intrigued by the Internet, Mr. Bohnett and a friend, John Renzer, bought a $5,000 computer powerful enough to serve up Web pages and published a little site with a live picture of the Intersection of Hollywood and Vine and a few other locales. **********Within a year, they seized on the idea of giving users free home pages and organizing them into ''virtual'' cities, arranged loosely by topic. Thus, when a new ''homesteader,'' in Geocities' lingo, wants to set up a page, he or she selects a lot in a particular city. Those who are interested in cars move into Motor City; jazz fans choose Bourbon Street. **********The most heavily populated of the 40 cities are Silicon Valley, about computers, and South Beach, a vast spring break-style party. But the most popular destination among visiting Web surfers is Hollywood, the home of most of the fan pages, including Mr. Brown's Monty Python page. **********Most of the sites are simple, even hokey affairs, offering photos of pets, love poems, pie recipes and other matter that lived between the refrigerator and a magnet in the past. But some are much more elaborate. **********''If you're a bank clerk by day and a Smashing Pumpkins fan by night, this gives you an opportunity to express yourself,'' Mr. Bohnett said. **********Once they expose themselves to the world, Geocities members closely watch the count of how many visitors their sites attract, and they express glee at receiving an E-mail from a far-off place. **********''I was a ham radio operator in high school,'' Mr. Bohnett said. ''It was exciting to collect postcards from people you talked to around the world. That is a lot of what the Web is about.'' **********Even more surprising, people started sending E-mail to their virtual neighbors to comment on their sites and offer help. **********Mr. Rezner, now the company's chief technical officer, said, ''People actually go out of their way to become block captains, to join welcome wagons and to monitor chat rooms so they can have a neighborhood that is safe and clean.'' **********Indeed, Geocities now has 1,500 volunteer community leaders who help other members and watch out for offensive behavior. **********''The community leader program is the perfect environment for folks with a 'helper complex,' '' said Sherri Kaufmann, a housewife in rural Minnesota. She originally joined Geocities to show off pictures of her 10 children. Now she spends an hour a day on the computer in her kitchen watching over her corner of the ''Picket Fence'' neighborhood. **********''We truly are a community of neighbors who help each other out,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''I have made many friends here. Recently, my father became ill, and I was overwhelmed by the letters from the friends I have made at Geocities.'' **********But even more powerful than the common human urge to help a neighbor, however virtual, is the sexual urge. Much of the time of the volunteers and of Geocities' small staff is spent rooting out pornography that sprouts constantly on members' pages, as well as other illegal or objectionable material. **********''We've gone through seemingly endless debates about content guidelines,'' Mr. Bohnett said. **********And, still, its rules are uncomfortable compromises: Political opinion is O.K.; hate speech is not. You can have a page about sex but no pictures of naked people, unless they are classic artworks or on pages about nudism as a life style. Most members can criticize Geocities on their pages somewhat, but community leaders cannot. **********Similarly, Geocities has been in a constant battle with its members about how much of their pages it controls for advertising and promotion. Other protests arose when the service began superimposing advertisements over members' pages. **********Geocities has not been able to fill the ad space that it does have. Last year, the company had only six advertisers. Now, after a reorganization of its sales force, it says it has more than 100. But its members' pages are only about 25 percent sold. **********Now, with a new management team drawn from larger media companies, Geocities is trying to find ways to turn its audience into cash. It has tinkered with the design of the site to create more places for ads and to keep surfers longer at Geocities, especially on those pages that attract ad rates with a high cost for every thousand visitors, like pages about cars and other expensive items. **********And it is coming up with other sources of revenue. There are deals with on-line merchants like Amazon.com, which will sell books recommended on member pages, paying commissions to both the member and Geocities. There are services that for a fee let the most dedicated members build more ambitious and complex sites. And for those who want to set up business in cyberspace, it has started a program called Geoshops to display on-line storefronts for which it charges monthly fees starting at $25 a month. **********Taken together, Geocities hopes all these initiatives will quadruple its revenue from $4.6 million last year to a range of $20 million to $25 million this year, Mr. Bohnett said in March. Stephen L. Hansen, the company's chief financial officer, said in March that he expected Geocities to break even next year. **********But this rush to make money is leaving some members behind. **********''Right now, I feel they are pushing commercialism a little too much with all the home pages inundated with ads and links to ads,'' said Sharyn Gleaves, who has built an elaborate site devoted to drumming around campfires. **********Indeed, Mr. Brown says he is about to move his Monty Python site to another service. **********Yet Mr. Rezner, the co-founder, argues that making money is just another aspect of Geocities' virtual vision. **********''Everything in the real world should be mirrored in Geocities,'' he said. ''What do you do? You go to bars. You talk to people. You find a date. But you also go shopping, and you have a job.'' **********And, for that matter, there are virtual protests, boycotts and heroes as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/business/mutual-funds-report-in-closed-end-funds-a-fire-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Rick Gladstone", "pub_date": "1998-10-11", "snippet": "Article on bargains that can be found among emerging-market closed-end mutual funds (M)", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Closed-End Funds, a Fire Sale", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; In Closed-End Funds, a Fire Sale", "body_text": " **********WITH the embers still smoldering from the financial-market firebombings of the third quarter, prospective investors in closed-end funds might want to borrow a few lessons from junkyard dogs and other naturally skilled scavengers: Venture forth, sniff around and, perhaps, bite. **********The adventurous will inevitably be drawn to what appears to be the wasteland of emerging-market closed-end funds, which endured some of the worst of the destruction. Many have fallen by more than half from what were already low levels; some are trading for a few dollars or less a share. **********For anyone who bought these funds years ago, when prices were high and Wall Street gushed about the coming boom in Asia, Russia and Latin America, buying may seem less tempting now that the economies there have fallen so steeply. But if you missed the peak, opportunity may be staring at you. **********''This is where I think the most money will be made over the next 12 months -- the most money in the closed-end fund universe, anyway,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, chairman  of an investment advisory firm in Miami that tracks closed-end funds. ''They've just been pummeled. Fifty, 60 and 70 percent losses are not unusual.'' **********These funds, which issue a fixed number of shares that are traded like those of ordinary companies, have often fallen much further than the underlying values of their holdings have. This divergence is especially wide in Latin America, where stock prices as measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for the region have fallen 45 percent this year -- most of that in the third quarter. **********But the gap helps create a new opportunity, Mr. Herzfeld and others say. Eventually, the shares and net asset values should converge. **********Buying shares of a fund that is trading at a 25 percent discount to its net asset value, for example, is like buying a $100 stock for $75. Many of these funds, however, are trading at even greater discounts. **********Closed-end funds can trade at discounts for various reasons -- shaky  economic fundamentals, bad management, poor performance. But the severe declines in stocks have contributed to some of the widest discounts in years, especially among Latin American equity funds. **********Mr. Herzfeld cited the Latin American Discovery fund, whose discount grew from 2 percent in March to 21.7 percent at the end of September. The Latin American Equity fund behaved similarly; its discount widened from 15 percent in February to 29.9 percent at the end of September. **********One reason for the selloff is that many investors panicked after Russia defaulted on its debts in August. Sensing a spreading malaise, they dumped shares no matter where their funds were invested. **********''No one really knows where the bottom is, but there's no question that discounts have gotten pretty deep,'' said Gregg Wolper, international funds editor at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. ''That's why more of the bargains are in Latin America.'' **********Others say funds invested in central Europe were also unfairly pummeled. Douglas Beck, an emerging-markets strategist at Merrill Lynch, is looking at funds with stakes in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which he saw as likely to recover even if Russia kept foundering: ''I think it's time for investors to dip their toes back into certain markets. What we're telling clients is,  regardless of what discounts do, we're making the assumption that discounts are close to an extreme. If you're looking to gain exposure now, the ability to purchase a diverse pool at a 20 to 25 percent discount is a tremendous opportunity.'' **********He said he was looking at two funds that do not have exposure to Russia: Central European Equity, which is 30 percent invested in Germany, and Central European Value, heavily invested in the Czech Republic. Both are trading at discounts of substantially more than 20 percent. **********OF course, many people doubt that the worst is over. Some closed-end fund strategists say they remain extremely wary about Latin America partly because it is unclear whether countries like Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico will need to devalue their currencies or require International Monetary Fund bailouts. **********''There's good reason to feel the contagion has seeped into Latin America,'' said Michael T. Porter, a closed-end fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''If you feel it's a question of when, not if, the currencies come under great pressure, then a 30 percent discount in closed-end funds today may not look so big.'' **********Mr. Porter said he was looking at emerging-market bond funds; although the shares of these funds are not trading at steep discounts -- some are even trading at premiums -- their yields are relatively high. **********''In a slow-growth global environment, I might want to take bond funds relative to equities,'' he said. **********As examples of possible buying opportunities, he offered the Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Debt fund, which was yielding nearly 15 percent at the end of September, and Templeton Emerging Markets Income, yielding 13.6 percent. The Morgan Stanley fund has a discount of 23.2 percent, and the Templeton fund has a premium of 1.4 percent. **********Mr. Porter argued that even if countries represented in these funds devalued their currencies, the damage would be minimal because much of the debt held by the funds is denominated in dollars. But stocks in equity funds are denominated in local currencies and can tumble in value if there is a devaluation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/23/business/markets-market-place-computer-associates-stock-option-plan-comes-home-roost.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-07-23", "snippet": "Rich compensation package for three top executives of Computer Associates International Inc has hurt company's second-quarter earnings and contributed to large selloff; on volume of more than 25 million shares, stock lost more than 30 percent of i...", "word_count": 1053, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; At Computer Associates, Stock Option Plan Comes Home to Roost", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; At Computer Associates, Stock Option Plan Comes Home to Roost", "body_text": " **********An avalanche of selling hit the stock of Computer Associates International Inc. yesterday, after the company announced late Tuesday that unexpected tremors from the Asian economic crisis had reduced its sales expectations. **********On extremely heavy volume of more than 25 million shares, the company's stock lost more than 30 percent of its market value, closing at $39.50, down $17.50. That represented a loss of $9.56 billion for investors in the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y. **********Computer Associates derives only about 5 percent of its revenues from customers in Asia, so news of Asia-related sales weak ness clearly caught Wall Street by surprise. But the reaction may have been exacerbated because the bad news came just two months after Charles B. Wang, the chairman and chief executive, and two other top executives received a remarkable $1.1 billion stock grant that wound up costing the company about $675 million. **********''It left a bitter taste in the mouth,'' James C. Mendelson, managing director of Soundview Financial Group, in Stamford, Conn., said. ''Clearly, some portion of the selloff is an emotional reaction.'' **********The company included the warning about its sales prospects for the next six months in an announcement of its financial results for three months ended June 30. The report was released after the market closed on Tuesday, after which senior executives participated in a conference call with analysts. During that call, the executives explained that many of their big multinational customers seemed to be expecting slower growth in their own businesses primarily because of the problems in Asia. Those customers, who also have to deal with the Year 2000 adjustments, seemed to be holding back on major software purchases, the executives said. The analysts swiftly scaled back their expectations for Computer Associates' full-year earnings by about 7 percent. **********That bad news swamped the good news that the company's basic income had been slightly above expectations in the most recent quarter. With analysts expecting earnings of 33 cents a share, the company reported operating profits of 34 cents a share, or $194.2 million, up almost 25 percent from the $155.8 million the company earned in the comparable period last year. **********However, those respectable quarterly results were buried by the effects of the $675 million write-off necessary to finance the stock grants to Mr. Wang and to Sanjay Kumar, the president, and Russell M. Artzt, the executive vice president. Because of the write-off, the company reported a loss of $480.8 million, or 87 cents a share, for the quarter. **********The compensation plan, approved by shareholders in 1995, entitled the three executives to collect substantial grants of stock as soon as the company's shares had traded above a set price, $53.33 a share, for 60 trading days -- a milestone that was reached on May 21. **********As a result, Mr. Wang was awarded 12.15 million shares, which at the time were worth $669.8 million; Mr. Kumar received 6.075 million shares, which were worth $334.9 million, and Mr. Artzt received 2.025 million shares, which were worth $111.6 million. The total package was valued at $1.1 billion before taxes, but the executives essentially returned some shares to satisfy income tax obligations, reducing the package to $675 million. **********Restrictions on selling the shares will expire gradually over the next seven years, so the three executives actually suffered as much or more damage yesterday as their fellow shareholders. Mr. Wang, for example, saw the value of his recent stock grant fall by more than $200 million yesterday. **********Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist and editor of The Crystal Report, had been extremely critical of Mr. Wang's generous compensation packages even before the recent stock grants were awarded.  Yesterday's news did nothing to soften his opinion, even though the selloff reduced the current value of the stock grants to Mr. Wang. **********''He limped across the finish line, collected his huge stock award, and then suddenly they have just discovered this Asia problem,'' Mr. Crystal said. ''I think we will see lots of lawsuits. This will be like dropping 3,000 pounds of chum into a shark tank.'' **********But even Mr. Crystal said he was surprised at how deeply the stock declined yesterday, and wondered aloud whether Wall Street analysts had simply forgotten about the potential impact of the stock awards on the company's earnings. **********Joseph Farley, a stock analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, dismissed that speculation. ''The compensation plan was well known,'' Mr. Farley said. ''There was no surprise today from people just finding out about the earnings impact.'' **********There may have been some lingering resentment, Mr. Mendelson said. ''There is some bitterness being expressed,'' he said. But Mr. Mendelson defended the company's decision to share its worries about the future with its stockholders. **********''I think it reflects their desire to be as straight with the investment community as they can be,'' he said. With the company's annual stockholders meeting scheduled for Aug. 12, he added: ''It must have been a temptation to say, 'If we postpone the report a few weeks, we won't have to face our shareholders until next year.' But they did not say that.'' **********Mr. Farley remains wary, however. ''Is the selloff overdone? I think we've all got about 5 percent of the information we need to answer that question,'' he said. ''We have a company that has had a long period of very strong revenue momentum and predictability of earnings, and suddenly you are facing some vague, uncertain developments and we don't really know what happened.'' **********The Computer Associates announcement came in tandem with a similar warning from the Hewlett-Packard Company, reinforcing in several analysts' minds the need to look more closely at how vulnerable technology companies are to such secondary effects of the Asian crisis. **********Mr. Crystal pointed out that Institutional Shareholder Services, a company in Bethesda, Md., that advises investors on how to vote on proxy issues, had recommended against approval of the stock-grant plan when it was proposed in 1995. ''But it was approved by investors anyway,'' he said. ''So I guess you could say, stockholders got their comeuppance today.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/business/company-news-phelps-dodge-to-close-2-copper-mines-and-cut-680-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-10-22", "snippet": "Phelps Dodge Corp will eliminate about 680 jobs as it closes two copper mines, in New Mexico and Chile, because of continued low copper prices (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHELPS DODGE TO CLOSE 2 COPPER MINES AND CUT 680 JOBS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PHELPS DODGE TO CLOSE 2 COPPER MINES AND CUT 680 JOBS", "body_text": " **********The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the largest United States copper producer, said yesterday that it would eliminate about 680 jobs as it closes two mines, in New Mexico and Chile, because of continued low copper prices.

I still think we can reach 40 percent. But it is going to be difficult. It is best to set a target that you can very likely achieve, but is still difficult to achieve. **********We can solve the problem by introducing new cars. We are probably introducing 12 to 13 different types of cars or vehicles a year. And at the same time, we are also scrapping the older, less successful models. **********To do so will take a large investment of people and resources, but I think the company has the strength of resources to do it. **********In the global market, we are making progress on our original goal of 10 percent, and we now have set a new goal of 15 percent by the year 2010. **********Q. The automobile industry is consolidating in much of the world. Will we see further  penetration of foreign ownership in the Japanese auto industry? Could a whole company be acquired? **********A. That's something that I've been thinking about very much. I think that's quite possible, especially as other currencies strengthen. Although the yen has been strong recently, it has been weak for a long time, and, generally speaking, the stock prices of Japanese automobile companies are low. Therefore, it is possible that an American or other foreign company could acquire one of the weaker Japanese companies. I think that's something that the Japanese auto makers are concerned about, including Toyota. **********Q. For Toyota, could you envision a partnership with an American company, or an American company buying Toyota? **********A. I think there can be two different ways that could work. The first would be an equity acquisition. The second would be in the area of localized technical cooperation. In the manufacture of engines and transmissions, and to develop environmental technologies, we have to make huge capital investments, so cooperation and joint efforts would make sense. Toyota could either provide or procure technology. **********Q. Your company also has an interest in being known as environmentally friendly. Does that goal correlate with some of the larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles that you now produce, like the Lexus line? **********A. First, today's situation is transitional, as new technology replaces old. Second, we must still respond to regional customer tastes as much as possible. For example, in the United States, larger vehicles are more popular. So we work to make our products as clean and efficient as possible, regardless of size. **********Q. In a country where executives are fairly conservative, you stand out. Do you see yourself as a role model? **********A. I don't think so. Everyone is different. But what I can say about Toyota is that before I became president, the company was considered to be very conservative, so I have tried to make us more aggressive. I think our example will be followed by other companies. Companies are being less conservative and that means even more competition, so the more conservative executives might not be around in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/business/prof-richard-allen-lester-89-expert-in-wage-and-labor-issues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-01-03", "snippet": "Richard Allen Lester, economist who specialized in wage and labor issues, and dean of faculty emeritus at Princeton University, dies at 89; photo (S)", "word_count": 353, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prof. Richard Allen Lester, 89, Expert in Wage and Labor Issues", "print_headline": "Prof. Richard Allen Lester, 89, Expert in Wage and Labor Issues", "body_text": " **********Richard Allen Lester, an economist who specialized in wage and labor issues, and a dean of the faculty, emeritus, at Princeton University, died on Tuesday at his home in Hightstown, N.J.

One early theory, called the ''range theory of wages,'' offered an alternative to the prevailing view that workers in similar jobs were paid the same wages. Professor Lester said that one implication of his theory was that because wages were indeterminate an increase in the minimum wage would not necessarily result in reduced employment. **********Professor Lester also studied the labor movement, unemployment and employment discrimination.

''Now we're united in grief.''  The blast was commemorated in public assemblies in dozens of cities and towns here and in the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic. The Irish President, Mary McAleese, spoke briefly.

And today, another Republican splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army, followed suit. This means that all major paramilitary groups, Catholic and Protestant, are now observing cease-fires, a development officials say should enhance the peace agreement approved in referendums here and in the Irish Republic. **********The Irish National Liberation Army's last admitted attack was on June 25, when a car bomb destroyed part of the border town of Newtownhamilton, wounding 11 people. **********The group's statement -- announced at the west Belfast headquarters of its political representatives, the Irish Republican Socialist Party -- means that only one anti-British organization in Northern Ireland, the Continuity I.R.A., a relatively small group, has yet to call a truce. **********''We recognize that the political situation has changed since the formation of I.N.L.A.,'' the statement said.

Those polls predicted no outright winner, with two possible outcomes: either a coalition government led by a Hindu nationalist group, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or a rival coalition of so-called secular parties opposed to Hindu nationalism. In the latter case, the coalition leader would probably be the Congress Party, which has governed India for more than 44 of the 50 years since independence in 1947. **********But political turmoil in the past 48 hours in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state and biggest electoral prize, has brought new uncertainty. Many Indian political commentators had already described it as one of the most confused since Indira Gandhi called an election in 1977, after a 20-month period of emergency rule, and contrary to most predictions lost in a landslide. **********Since the 1970's, election forecasts have become more perilous because of the larger number of political parties that have joined the fray -- more than 600 in the current election -- and the number of those parties, about 30, that are likely to win seats. **********The events in Uttar Pradesh, a banana-shaped state of 140-million people that lies along the banks of the Ganges River on India's impoverished northern plain, showed just how volatile the coalition politics forced on this nation of 980 million people by the multiplication of parties can be. **********A state government formed five months ago by Bharatiya Janata collapsed on Saturday night when defectors from two other parties, including Congress, switched sides and pledged their support to a coalition government formed by a cluster of parties, including Congress, that have little in common but opposition to Hindu nationalism. **********By all accounts, the defections that brought down the Hindu party's most important state government were organized by its opponents to cause a loss of face on the eve of voting in the state in the national election. **********Apart from presenting the Hindu party as a loser in a state that it has to win by a large margin to have any hope of triumphing in the national vote, the purpose of the exercise appeared to be to strike at the power that its government, like all state governments in India, had to influence voting patterns through its control of the local administration. **********The strategy's impact on the voting in Uttar Pradesh was questionable, coming as it did only hours before the polls opened in the state -- and too late for 52 of the state's 85 electoral districts, where voting already took place last Monday. In any case, it was far from certain whether the new coalition sworn into power on Saturday night in Lucknow, the state capital, would last. **********An emergency session today of the High Court in Lucknow delayed until at least Monday a decision on a challenge by the Hindu party to the legality of the state government's ouster. The party contended that the Congress-appointed state governor allowed the takeover without allowing the administration to test its support in the state legislature. **********While this left Uttar Pradesh in a political limbo, opinions were divided as to the likely impact on the general election, in which there was voting today in 9 of India's 25 states. **********Some commentators thought that the blow to the Bharatiya Janata's  prestige could be costly in the third round of voting next Sunday, when another 150 million of the 600 million voters will go to the polls in an array of states. Next Sunday's voting includes a band of territory in southern India where the Hindu party and allied groups need a breakthrough to get to the number of seats, at least 215 by most estimates, that they need to have any prospect of forming a government coalition. **********Another view was that the turmoil in Lucknow could play to the party's  advantage by allowing its leaders to claim that its ascent to power in New Delhi over recent years has faced a ''conspiracy'' from Congress and other parties. **********A hint that the Hindu party's leaders inclined toward a pessimistic view came when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, its candidate for Prime Minister, announced he would begin a ''fast unto death'' in his Lucknow residence to protest the unseating of the Uttar Pradesh government. **********Mr. Vajpayee, 71, has generally been regarded as the most publicly acceptable face of the Hindu nationalists. He won a reputation as a safe pair of hands as Foreign Minister in a non-Congress Government in the late 1970's, and in the current campaign, he has almost completely shunned the disguised anti-Muslim rhetoric that has been a staple of Hindu nationalism. **********Mr. Vajpayee described the events in Lucknow as ''a deep-rooted conspiracy'' aimed at denying the Hindu party power in New Delhi, and added: ''To oppose it is my moral responsibility.'' **********Mr. Vajpayee's main rival for mass support in the election, Sonia Gandhi -- the Italian-born widow of Rajiv Gandhi, the former Congress Party leader and Prime Minister who was assassinated while campaigning in 1991 -- continued her own campaign today despite the upheaval in Uttar Pradesh, still drawing large crowds. **********Most polls have shown that Mrs. Gandhi's efforts have checked Congress' long downhill slide and could cause as many as 5 percent of the voters to shift back to Congress -- enough to make a Congress-led coalition government possible. **********With today's voting, only next Sunday's balloting remains before vote-counting begins, on March 2. Although voting in three electoral districts in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir will take place later, the counting that begins on March 2 is expected to provide results by March 3 in most of the 540 electoral districts up for election in the rest of the country. **********Two other seats are reserved for representatives of the ''the Anglo-Indian'' community, meaning people of mixed Indian and British descent, and they are filled by nomination after the new Parliament sits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/27/business/business-digest-676012.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Forecast for Windows 98: Slow Start, Steady Growth **********Government officials are racing to determine what antitrust action, if any, they should take against Microsoft before it ships Windows 98 to PC makers in May.

In this tightly run Asian citadel, the Lee family's crusade quickly became official policy. **********''It's very difficult to decide to change policies when they are working,'' said Lee Hsien Loong, 46, a brisk former Army general who also runs the powerful Monetary Authority and is expected to be the next Prime Minister. ''But we got feedback from bankers and others that if you want to take the next stage up, then really you have to shift gears and allow more free play.'' **********Few places on earth would set out to become more freewheeling as methodically as Singapore would. But experts in Asia are not about to poke fun: They say that this combination of flexibility and dogged determination has enabled Singapore to steer a remarkably steady course through the Asian economic typhoon. **********Although Singapore's economy finally slid into negative territory in the third quarter, it had held out longer than that of most of its neighbors. And several economists and analysts said that Singapore's strategy of cutting wages, allowing the currency to adjust downward and liberalizing the financial markets could mean that Singapore will be in healthier shape after the crisis than the normally resilient Hong Kong. **********While Hong Kong still has many advantages, Singapore is about to give it a run for its money. Singapore has introduced a futures contract based on the Hong Kong stock market that traders say is the most serious challenge yet to Hong Kong's status as the financial hub of East Asia. **********''Singapore has been more streetwise than Hong Kong,'' said J. Mark Mobius, the president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, which moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore because of its lower tax rates. ''They've exhibited a better understanding of the crisis and sounder policy.'' **********William H. Overholt, the director of Asia strategy at Nomura International in Hong Kong, added: ''Singapore has been much more willing to bite the bullet than Hong Kong. That's a big change.'' **********While Singapore has thrown off old regulations and taken a knife to its high costs, Hong Kong has moved in the opposite direction -- intervening to prop up its stock market, imposing a raft of new restrictions on trading and suspending Government sales of land to stem the decline in real estate prices. **********''We're seeing Hong Kong become more like the Singapore of the past, and Singapore become more like the Hong Kong of the past,'' said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong. **********For now at least, Hong Kong has geography on its side. While Hong Kong is the doorstep of China, a vast and still-growing economy, Singapore is sandwiched between two of Asia's sickest countries, Indonesia and Malaysia. Relations in the neighborhood are fragile in the best of times and have frayed badly under the pressure of the downturn. **********Indeed, officials here said Singapore's precarious geography has helped solidify popular support for the Government's painful recovery package, which seeks to carve $6.5 billion in costs out of the economy, mostly through a reduction of 5 percent to 8 percent in wages and even deeper cuts in pension benefits. **********''One reason Singapore has been so cohesive for so long is because of the economic and political stress we went through in the 1960's and 1970's,'' said the younger Mr. Lee, who introduced the package in Parliament. **********''When you are very small and you have to struggle for your living, if you don't hang together, you hang separately,'' he said. **********In Singapore, of course, it is often hard to separate active support from pliant acquiescence. The Lee family still dominates political discourse in this city-state of 3.4 million people. Its governing People's Action Party holds 81 of the 83 elected seats in the Parliament (10 members are appointed) and brooks little dissent from opposition leaders, labor unions or the media. **********About the only public grousing over economic policy has come from citizens' groups that say that Singapore's civil servants, among the world's best paid, should bear more of the wage cuts. **********''You're not going to see people marching in the streets or even a lot of letters in the papers,'' said Simon Tay, who is one of the 10 appointed members of Parliament. ''But the Government listens to the public and reacts.'' **********Chia Yew Boon has the glass-is-half-full outlook that is typical of Singaporeans. Mr. Chia was laid off recently when his employer, a foreign bank, retrenched in Asia. But he is considering several job offers and keeping things in perspective. **********''We're so much better off than the rest of Asia,'' Mr. Chia said over a lunch of Malay-Chinese food in one of Singapore's traditional Chinese neighborhoods. ''We're not seeing famine or riots in the streets.'' **********Considering its heavy dependence on trade with Indonesia and Malaysia, it is a minor miracle that Singapore's economy kept growing as long as it did. Output fell by 1.5 percent in the third quarter, the first quarter of reduced output in Singapore since 1986. Most economists think the city-state can still eke out positive economic numbers for the full year. **********The trouble is, at least 20 percent of Singapore's exports go to its two neighbors, both of which are in an economic free fall. Because economists predict that the two countries will continue to contract in 1999, it will be tough for Singapore to return to sustained growth before the millennium. **********The troubles of Singapore's neighbors have especially hurt in tourism and export services. Visitor arrivals are down 14.5 percent so far in 1998, and many of those who now come are fleeing riots in Jakarta rather than spending for getaway weekends at Singapore's swank hotels. **********Similarly, Singapore's lucrative export service business has collapsed, as financially troubled Indonesian and Malaysian companies can no longer afford to buy advertising, accounting and other services in Singapore. **********Malaysia has hurt Singapore in another highly visible way. When it imposed capital controls on its markets on Sept. 1, the country also prohibited shares of Malaysian companies from being traded in Singapore. **********Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, accused investors of using Singapore as a staging ground to speculate against Malaysia's currency. But the immediate effect of his action was to kill off a thriving market -- and deprive Singapore of an arrow in its quiver as a global financial center. **********Beyond these headaches, people in Singapore worry about the long-term stability of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. With 214 million people, deepening social strife and islands that lie just across the harbor from Singapore, an unstable Indonesia could pose an acute economic and security threat. **********''If these 200 million people are never again going to be a market for us, that will be a big problem,'' said Tan Kong Yam, head of the business policy department at the National University of Singapore. **********By drastically reducing costs, Singapore hopes to make its exports more competitive to those of the rest of the world. Although Asia accounts for half of its trade, Singapore is a leading exporter of electronics, petrochemicals and other products to the United States and Europe. **********Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore has allowed its currency to drift downward, though not as much as other regional currencies. In August, the Monetary Authority adopted a more flexible exchange-rate policy, and the Singapore dollar has since risen along with Asia's other resurgent currencies. **********Years before the current crisis, Singapore was eager to stake its claim as Asia's financial mecca. It exploited its convenient time zone to become the world's fourth-largest foreign-exchange market, after London, New York and Tokyo. But it trails Hong Kong in stock trading and asset management. **********Now, Singapore sees a chance to close the gap. It has opened its Government bond market, eased restrictions on foreign brokerage firms and tried to attract asset funds like Templeton by promising low or zero tax rates. **********Lee Kuan Yew, who inspired the moves, said in a written response to questions that he was influenced by Hong Kong's success, by discussions with leading bankers and by his membership on the international advisory board of J.

Simex hopes to steal business by offering lower margin requirements for its contracts than the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, which raised its margin requirements in September to thwart speculators. **********Investors have welcomed Singapore's foray, and many are considering whether to move their business southward. ''For the big players, Hong Kong's costs have become punitive,'' said Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the Pacific Group, an asset management fund in Hong Kong. **********Hong Kong gave itself even more of a black eye when it threatened to deprive Simex of the real-time data that traders need to calculate the value of the Hang Seng index. Investors were able to get the data on a Web site maintained by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. **********Now, officials in Hong Kong say they plan to cut prices to fend off the threat from Singapore. **********''Our objective is to maintain Hong Kong as the Manhattan of China,'' said Randy Gilmore, the chief executive of the futures exchange. **********For all of Singapore's moxie, Hong Kong will most likely cling to that mantle for some time. The difference, according to experts, is that Hong Kong's next-door neighbor, mainland China, is stable, growing, and friendly, while Singapore's neighbors are shaky, shrinking and potentially hostile. **********Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie, fueled Singapore's anxieties earlier this year when he dismissed the city-state as a ''red dot'' on the map. Singapore has also recently squabbled over its border crossings with Malaysia, with which it has a tangled history of close ties and bruised feelings. **********In building Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew frequently warned of disaster around the corner as a way to mobilize his people. His son said the current tribulations could have a bracing effect on a population lulled by peace and ever-growing prosperity. **********''It's been quite helpful for Singaporeans to have heard this remark about the 'little red dot' because that's what we have been telling them, too,'' the younger Mr. Lee said with a wry laugh. ''So it's a timely reminder.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/02/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1998-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********YEN DROPS FOR FOURTH DAY.

D. Power & Associates customer satisfaction survey for flights of more than 500 miles. It also has one of the best on-time records. Some industry observers say this reputation might erode through affiliation with Northwest, which has been beset recently by customer complaints and poor on-time performance. **********Indeed, last year Northwest fell sharply in the Power survey, placing ''below the industry average,'' according to a Power spokesman, in both long and short flights. In 1996, the carrier placed second to Continental on long flights, and was first in short flights. **********''Continental could be the big loser in this alliance, if Northwest begins imposing its standards,'' said Joe Brancatelli, who is a columnist for Trip.com (www.thetrip.com), a World Wide Web site for business travelers. In a recent column, Mr. Brancatelli excoriated Northwest's customer service and vowed not to fly the carrier again. **********Others say such a situation is unlikely. ''Northwest's outlay is a little over $311 million, less than a quarter of their liquidity,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst with Paine Webber. ''So it's hard to see how a 25 percent reduction in their cash position could remotely affect service standards.'' **********Joseph Berman, an analyst with Avmark, an airline consulting company in Arlington, Va., said that contrary to Northwest's low standing in Department of Transportation rankings, which are based on customer complaints, the airline has gotten ''a bum rap'' -- especially since hiring a new head of customer service less than a year ago. **********Continental does not appear worried. ''We think we understand the formula for achieving customer satisfaction,'' said David Messing, a spokesman for Continental. ''We think Northwest also understands the formula, and they're working very hard to achieve it.'' **********Northwest said it, too, was committed to providing excellent customer service. ''We made a significant investment to address these issues,'' Kathy Peach, a spokeswoman, said. ''The difference in the ratings among airlines is very small.'' **********The carriers' frequent-flier programs are expected to be linked by June 1. While many details are still to be worked out, the prospects seem to benefit the consumer. **********''This alliance offers frequent-flier members a lot more choices than in their individual programs, especially since there's so little overlap in their routes,'' said David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association in Washington. Adding KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Northwest's partner, extends that frequent-flier reach even further, he said. **********Continental's program is considered among the industry's most generous: its elite level -- which confers  upgrades and other benefits -- is  reached at 20,000 miles flown, and accrued miles face no time limits on their use. With some exceptions, Northwest's program requires 25,000 miles flown for similar perks; miles expire after three years. **********Mr. Messing said the two programs would probably function ''the way our program with America West does.'' Travelers enrolled with either Continental or America West can redeem miles earned flying on the other airline. **********Signals of an airline's service quality range from the condition of airplane interiors to in-flight food. But Mr. Stempler said the surest indication was the number of flights canceled for reasons other than weather. **********''Carriers with reliable service usually spend a lot of money having mechanics and spare parts available at airports away from their hubs,'' he said. ''That way they can fix minor mechanical problems there on the spot, even if it causes delays.'' Airlines that cut back, he said, must cancel flights to take planes back to their maintenance bases. **********Another sign might be any sharp change in top staff. ''This transaction does represent a change of control that will result in the immediate vesting of all management stock options at Continental,'' Mr. Buttrick said. ''In effect, the golden handcuffs come off, so management of Continental Airlines will be freer to pursue other opportunities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/13/world/political-parties-opposed-to-bosnia-peace-get-millions-in-rent-from-nato.html": {"writer_name": "Mike O'Connor", "pub_date": "1998-10-13", "snippet": "Financial experts say NATO forces in Bosnia and Croatia are needlessly paying millions of dollars in rent that is winding up in coffers of the political parties, that are often principal obstacles to peace; even though 1995 Dayton accord required ...", "word_count": 1074, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Political Parties Opposed to Bosnia Peace Get Millions in Rent From NATO", "print_headline": "Political Parties Opposed to Bosnia Peace Get Millions in Rent From NATO", "body_text": " **********NATO forces in Bosnia and Croatia are needlessly paying millions of dollars in rent that is winding up in the coffers of the governing political parties, say financial experts who have studied the two governments. And diplomats say those parties are often the principal obstacles to peace. **********The 1995 Dayton accord, which ended the war in Bosnia and authorized NATO's presence, required Bosnia and Croatia to provide buildings and land to NATO troops without charge. **********But the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other countries may be spending as much as $40 million a year in rent for their bases in Bosnia and Croatia, a senior NATO financial officer said. **********The exact figures could not be determined, because many of the armies involved refused to disclose how much they were paying. In addition, NATO financial officers said their records were in disarray. **********Defending the payments, NATO officers said they went to private companies for use of their property. But while many of the companies receiving the rent portray themselves as privately owned, they appear to be Government-owned and controlled by political parties. **********Interviews with company and local government officials, as well as financial experts working for Western governments in Bosnia and Croatia, indicate that much of the money is going to the Bosnian and Croatian Governments, which funnel it to political parties. Foreign diplomats suggested that in Bosnia, the money effectively buys good relations between NATO forces and local and national leaders. **********Almost three years after fighting ended, Bosnia continues to be governed by ethnic-based parties that effectively dominate three mini states. Croatia is governed by a nationalist party that virtually controls the parts of Bosnia held by ethnic Croats. Foreign diplomats say they blame those parties for blocking the Western goal of a unified and stable country with an effective national Government. **********On being told about the payments, the chief international civilian official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, said they undermined Western efforts. ''How can they pay money to these people when we are supposed to be here promoting democracy?'' he asked. **********Each foreign military force in Bosnia pays the costs of maintaining its soldiers here, while NATO pays the costs of the large headquarters that directs the operation. The British Army says it will spend about $16.5 million this year to rent its eight bases in Bosnia and Croatia. **********The United States Army says it pays rent only for bases on private land. A spokesman said the Army had spent ''several million dollars'' for rent in the last three years, including about $1.5 million a year for a single base in Croatia, but he could not detail all rents paid. **********The United States Army insists that great efforts are made to insure that it pays no rent to Government-controlled companies. But at many places where the United States has or had troops, it is not clear that the Army has always succeeded. **********A pattern emerged in interviews with local officials and with managers of companies whose property is being used by American troops and other NATO forces. It was clear that payments were being made to companies that managers admitted were Government-owned. **********For example, the Bosnian company that received the most rent from the United States, according to Army records, was paid $1.4 million to allow soldiers to put a base at its coal processing plant for nine months. **********The company's director, Pasaga Muratovic, said the company had always been wholly owned by the Bosnian Government. **********Another coal mine operation used for an American camp was paid about $744,000, the Army reported. But Sakib Dizdarevic, the mine's director, said that it, too, was owned by the Bosnian Government, and that the payment was nearly three times that amount. **********For most of 1996, the Army base named Pat lay on farmland controlled by the most radical Bosnian Serb political party, whose founder, the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, has been indicted on war crimes charges. **********Army records show no rental payment for the camp, a spokesman said. But the Mayor of the nearest town, Sekovici, said his office was paid more than $26,000 a month by the Army. The money is used for Bosnian Serb government expenses, he said. Local farmers said that although the land belonged to them, they received none of the rent. **********The headquarters of the British Army in Bosnia is in a large, unused sheet metal factory near the Bosnian Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka. The financial director of the factory, Milo Milovanovic, said that to qualify for rent, company officials had told British officers that the factory was privately owned. **********But in an interview, he conceded that the factory was controlled by Bosnian Serb officials. All of the company's directors, he said, were appointed by Government officials. Mr. Milovanovic said the money received for rent was turned over to the Government for what he described as taxes and insurance. **********In the town of Sipovo, the Deputy Mayor, Mile Bosnjak, said earlier this year that all the rent paid by British forces for an abandoned textile factory was transferred directly from the factory's bank account to the Bosnian Serb government. **********Germany and France also pay rent. A spokesman for the French Army refused to provide details, while records kept by the German Army showed that it paid $2.5 million last year to rent warehouses from a Bosnian Government company in Sarajevo. **********Rent money from government-controlled businesses goes to the political party in control in the area, said foreign financial experts studying the Bosnian economy. **********''Every important manager of these companies is appointed by the political parties,'' said Didier Fau, chief of the Economic Department at Mr. Westendorp's office. ''They do what they are told. **********Most of the NATO rent appears to have been paid to the huge state- controlled holding companies that dominated the Bosnian economy under Communism. Managers of the companies often say they have been transformed into private concerns, but the law that would allow privatization of Government enterprises was not passed until July and has yet to take effect. NATO forces have been paying rent since December 1995. **********Officials of the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, say the number of privatized companies is ''infinitesimal.'' **********''It is closer to zero percent, than one percent,'' said Richard Rutherford, the principal investment officer for the International Finance Corporation in Europe. **********Even so, Lieut. Col. James Kerrick, speaking for the American Army in Bosnia, said the ownership of properties where the Army paid rent was thoroughly investigated to make sure that it was truly private."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/12/your-money/IHT-you-should-live-to-be-100-and-you-just-might.html": {"writer_name": "Conrad De Aenlle", "pub_date": "1998-12-12", "snippet": "\"WE ALWAYS thought that at 65 we would retire, then play golf,\" says Jeremy Rifkin. \"For a lot of people now, that is just over midlife.\" Mr. Rifkin author, lecturer and diviner of scientific and economic trends \u2014 thinks that a l", "word_count": 6313, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "You Should Live to Be 100 \u2014 and You Just Might", "print_headline": "You Should Live to Be 100 \u2014 and You Just Might", "body_text": " **********\"WE ALWAYS thought that at 65 we would retire, then play golf,\" says Jeremy Rifkin. \"For a lot of people now, that is just over midlife.\" Mr. Rifkin author, lecturer and diviner of scientific and economic trends \u2014 thinks that a lot more of us, not long from now, will have to rethink our notions of old age and retirement as advances in genetic research and treatment reset the upper limit of the life span. **********\"No one knows for sure,\" he cautioned, \"but if you have a very sophisticated approach to keeping people well through diet and exercise, it seems not unlikely to have the average life span at 100 to 110 for people who are here now, people who are 2 to 3 years old. **********\"I'm being very conservative now. There is no reason in the next 20 years why we couldn't have a life span of 100 or a little more.

Depending on how fast the technology moves into the marketplace, it's not unlikely to extend the life span five to 10 years for many people.\" **********This is the advent of the \"biotech revolution,\" Mr. Rifkin said, citing some of the initial skirmishes that have been occurring with astounding frequency: sheep cloning; genetic mapping and screening; manufacture and regeneration of human body parts; the creation of interspecies hybrid cells. **********Research being done now, he said, will bring changes in all facets of life \u2014 including how long it lasts. **********\"This is not a marginal evolution, but a core revolution of the 21st century,\" said Mr. Rifkin, who founded the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington and is an adviser to governments and a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. He is the author of \"The Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World.\" **********He prefers a revolution along the \"soft path,\" with genetic screens used to devise the best programs of nutrition and exercise to maximize each person's life span. People found through screens at birth to face a risk of developing colon cancer, for instance, could be started on a high-fiber diet at the appropriate time. **********\"Over 95 percent of longevity is accounted for by better nutrition, hygiene and sanitation,\" he said. \"The way to use this science is to have a sophisticated 21st-century preventive health regime in the commercial marketplace.\" **********This approach, apart from being practical, would eliminate the ethical and social concerns of such \"hard-path\" procedures as gene-replacement therapy and, perhaps, the development of made-to-order genes. **********\"They are based on totally different approaches, with a totally different frame of reference and value system, and with different results for society,\" he said. Among his misgivings is that the quantity and quality of life could be held for ransom by a handful of multinational pharmaceutical companies owning patents on all 100,000 human genes. **********Life-science companies are looking for \"ways to control genetic instructions to extend age,\" he said. \"The hope is to turn the human stem cell into a living factory that they can control to turn on switches to produce those parts of the body they need to regenerate.\" **********The stem cell is what embryos are made of before cells become differentiated into the building blocks of the various systems of the body: blood, nerves, muscles and so forth. **********\"That's a big problem on commercial and philosophical grounds,\" he said. \"The public might be quite shocked at the prospect of global life-science companies having patents on the human blueprint. **********\"Whoever controls the genes controls the 21st century,\" he said. \"It will be as critical in the next century and controlling materials and fuels was in the industrial era.\" **********The hard-path approach, he contended, \"raises serious questions of eugenics.\" Genetic screens are already being used to influence decisions on employment, education and health insurance. It is not far-fetched to think of a two-tiered society in which the \"haves\" are born with the right genes, or have the money to buy them, and the \"have-nots\" must get by with Brand X genes. Another result could be \"gene wars\" between northern countries, which have the money and scientific expertise, and southern countries, which are rich in genetic diversity. **********\"There's a broader ethical issue here,\" he said. \"Does life have intrinsic value, or is it just intellectual property with commercial utility in the market? I think we'll see in a few years a genetic-rights movement.\" **********Mr. Rifkin dismisses the hard-path types as simplistic reductionists. He notes that their philosophy has been used to suggest that someday the contents of human brains might be stored on computer disks and placed in new receptacles to produce a sort of immortality. **********If the hard-path approach wins the day, he said, old age may be spent unpleasantly, repeatedly replacing body parts and cells that have gone on the fritz. If the path to extended life is as soft as he hopes, then those added years will be spent in good health. **********Mr. Rifkin has a few ideas about how people will be spending that extra time: \"As people get older, what we're going to begin to see are new opportunities beyond the marketplace and beyond government,\" he predicted. These will occur in a \"third sector\" of cultural, religious, civic and fraternal organizations. **********\"Why not begin to have spirited debate in every country on the possibility of creating separate vocations \u2014 paid, full or part-time?\" he said. **********\"We have to think from an early age about a vocation, and we have to plan financially much more carefully. If we live to 100, what's going to happen to Social Security? We have to understand that increased longevity brings with it added responsibilities. This notion of retirement should be eliminated altogether.\" **********- **********For further information: **********- **********THE BIOTECH CENTURY: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World.

Back in 1996, I was the host of a weekly on-line show called ''Web Whirl,'' the goal of which was to take the audience along on a tour of a dozen or so Web sites. **********The show didn't work because most home users were at the wrong end of an information bottleneck. Relying on fickle modem connections, their on-line forays resembled uneasy games of Russian roulette. Would they connect on the first try? Or even the second? Would their connections fail in the middle of downloading a Web page? After a few months, the show was canceled. **********So when I heard that the Intel Corporation was planning to broadcast the live performances of 300 bands on line this week and call the adventure a ''music festival,'' my first reaction was skepticism. After all, not much has changed in the past two years to erase the obstacles that doomed ''Web Whirl.'' Today, with most home users still relying on finicky modems, will the so-called streaming video clip from a concert arrive instead as herky-jerky niblets of image? **********I hoped not. But my first glance at the Web page for the festival (which began last night and will run through Saturday) did not reassure me. The broadcast site at www.intelfest.com instructed me to download the software tool Real Player from Real Networks so I could hear and see the on-line performances. But my first two attempts failed because somewhere between the computer where Real Player was archived and my own desktop, the connection failed. **********With 300 bands playing live in 20 New York City clubs for the four-day period, Intel faces an even greater technical challenge. For each band, the club sets up a microphone to capture vocals and the softer instruments like flutes and violins, mixing those sounds at a main sound desk. Another microphone supplied by Intel picks up other instruments, like drums and guitars. Then the feeds from both microphones are mixed and prepared for on-line broadcast on a personal computer that encodes the sound and translates it into digital bits. Intel broadcasts the digital transmission through two dual-Pentium II 333-megahertz servers, which in turn distribute the signals over the Internet. Performances at five clubs are also being broadcast in a simultaneous video feed. **********The home users with the best chance of enjoying the performances are those with newer equipment. While you might technically be able to connect to the festival's Web site on a poky old 486 machine, I doubt that you could enjoy the experience with anything less than a microprocessor that runs at 166 megahertz and employs MMX technology to enhance audio and video. As for modem speed? Well, frankly, there is no dial-up modem that pushes sound and video across the Net reliably enough -- or fast enough -- to satisfy me. **********''So why bother?'' the curmudgeon in me wondered. The whole venture sounded like a flashback to the early days of radio or TV, with the broadcasters relying on an uneasy combination of prayer, spit and willpower to overcome inevitably choppy transmissions. But then, those early broadcasts, imperfect though they may have been, were exciting partly because of the unknown limits of raw technology. The roughness was fraught with endless possibility. **********So maybe I was being unfair to the Internet -- and to Intel -- by expecting too much too soon from this nascent medium. Why not give everyone points for trying? During a similar festival that Intel sponsored last year, 125,000 computer users tuned in, er, connected -- five times as many as attended the live performances. Weren't those numbers an indication that the experiment was at least somewhat successful in increasing people's access to music? **********A closer look at the schedule on the festival Web site also swayed me. The musicians in that eclectic group of 300 bands, whose sounds include  rock, punk, rap, jazz and folk -- would surely not have agreed to participate in this endeavor if they felt that the medium failed to convey their message. There must be benefits from playing to an on-line audience that would outweigh the apparent lack of intimacy between performer and listener. **********I decided to ask a singer, Victoria Williams, who was scheduled to perform in the festival live (and on line) at the Bowery Ballroom last night. **********A few days before the performance, I spoke on the phone to Ms. Williams to tell her that I had just been listening to the folky, lyrical stories she sang on ''This Moment in Toronto With Victoria Williams,'' recorded live in 1995. ''Do you think that you will interact differently with an on-line audience?'' I asked. **********There was a moment of silence on the phone that lasted just long enough to make me wonder if the connection had failed. ''I had no idea that this is an on-line concert that I'm doing,'' Ms. Williams said. ''I thought it was a live concert.'' **********I explained about the computers that would transmit her performance across the Net. **********''You mean that people are going to be able to watch it on their computers, but it will sound kind of broken up, with herky-jerky video?'' she asked. **********I told her I wasn't sure whether the Bowery Ballroom was one of the five clubs that would transmit simultaneous video. (I quickly tried to check the Web site for her, but my connection stalled.) **********But Ms. Williams sounded so unhappy about the possibility that I felt bad for her. ''Maybe it will all work fine,'' I said, trying to sound as if I had not lived through the broadcast disappointment of ''Web Whirl.'' **********After all, I went on, here was a medium that might have the power to propel her music to a whole new audience -- to millions of people around the world who could not physically attend her concert. Maybe the Internet would prove to be as potent a broadcast tool as television had been in 1964 when Ed Sullivan introduced the Beatles to 73 million viewers. **********''Wouldn't that be great?'' I said cheerily. **********''I've just never seen it like that, but it would be incredible,'' Ms. Williams agreed. She paused again. ''Or maybe the band and I could just walk kind of herky-jerky in the club, and shuffle our feet a bit, to give the live audience the Internet experience.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/10/business/media-business-advertising-spanish-speaking-consumers-are-object-growing-number.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1998-07-10", "snippet": "Hispanic Business magazine says advertisers spent $1.4 billion last year trying to reach Spanish-speaking and bilingual Hispanic consumers; figure is more than double $628.2 million spent in 1990 and four times $333.5 million of 1985; experts say ...", "word_count": 875, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spanish-speaking consumers are the object of a growing number of marketers' desires.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Spanish-speaking consumers are the object of a growing number of marketers' desires.", "body_text": " **********ILINGUAL education may be under attack in the public schools, but American businesses do speak Spanish. **********Advertisers spent $1.4 billion last year trying to reach Spanish-speaking and bilingual Hispanic consumers, according to Hispanic Business magazine in Santa Barbara, Calif. That was more than double the $628.2 million spent in 1990 and four times the $333.5 million of 1985, based on the magazine's numbers. **********While still less than 1 percent of the $186.8 billion spent on all advertising here in 1997, according to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, experts say the Hispanic number will keep growing rapidly. **********''People are beginning to recognize that the Hispanic population is very large,'' said Dolores Kunda, director of Hispanic marketing at Leo Burnett U.S.A., part of the Leo Burnett Company and a board member of the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies. ''The Hispanic population is as large as the population of Canada,'' she said, referring to the perhaps 30 million people of Hispanic descent now living in the nation. **********The most recent census estimates for 1995 show the Hispanic population at 26.9 million, or just under 10 percent of the total population. The Census Bureau predicts that will rise to more than 11 percent in 2000 and to 13.8 percent in 2010, with the Hispanic population nudging out blacks to become the largest minority. **********In response, mainstream publications like Newsweek and People have come out with Spanish editions, Ms. Kunda said, and bilingual magazines like Latina are cropping up. **********The number of Hispanic radio stations has grown to more than 400, according to SRDS Hispanic Media and Market Source. **********And, while mainstream networks struggle to hold onto viewers in a world full of cable channels, Univision Communications Inc., the largest of two Hispanic networks, has grown to 2.8 million prime-time viewers today from 1.3 million in 1993, according to Anne Corley, vice president for public relations. It added more viewers in the coveted 18-  to 49-year-old segment than any other network, including NBC, between 1993 and 1997, she said. **********The ability to deliver a block of viewers has made Hispanic television so popular in places like Miami and Los Angeles that Spanish-language programming now leads in some time slots, said Ernest Bromley, chief executive of Bromley, Aguilar & Associates, a Hispanic advertising agency in San Antonio that is part of the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles unit of the MacManus Group. **********In the 1980's, Mr. Bromley said,  most advertisers were attracted to the Hispanic market for political reasons. ''Now, it's for marketing reasons,'' he said. ''They can see sales from the work that they do.'' **********While Hispanic Business tracks only those ads designed for the Hispanic, mostly Spanish-speaking media, Maria Zate, senior editor there, said a new breed of Hispanic ad has been cropping up over the last two or three years. These ads are in English and appear in mainstream media, she said, but are clearly aimed at  Hispanic consumers. **********She cites two examples, both for the McDonald's Corporation, one of the 10 largest advertisers to Hispanic consumers. One, she said, features a father and daughter in a McDonald's restaurant, discussing the girl's coming 15th-birthday gala. **********The other shows a toddler looking at McDonald's french fries, as his eager father tries to prod him to speak. When the child utters his first word, ''Papa,'' English-speaking viewers understand but only Spanish speakers get the joke that the word also means potato, Ms. Zate said. **********Just how much is being spent on such crossover advertising is tough to measure, she said, because determining whether the ad is aimed at Hispanic consumers can be subjective. **********Ads in English for Hispanic people might become more common because they now tend to be bilingual, she said. Figures from the 1990 census show that nine million of the 17.3 million Americans who spoke Spanish at home reported they also spoke English ''very well.'' Another 3.8 million reported speaking it ''well.'' **********But, she added, ''There's a lot of controversy there,'' because making Hispanic ads in English could undercut agencies that deal in Spanish-language ads. **********Bromley, Aguilar makes 85 to 90 percent of its ads in Spanish, Mr. Bromley said. The percentage of the Hispanic population who speak Spanish most of the time is going up,  not down, he maintained. ''We're seeing people who are English-dominant who are becoming more Hispanic,'' he said. ''They're reclaiming their language, renewed pride.'' **********''Are people going to increase their knowledge of English? Of course they are,'' Ms. Kunda said. ''Are they going to give up what makes them Hispanic, what is important to them?  I don't think so.'' **********Advertising tries to reach consumers on an emotional level, she said, and for the Hispanic population, ''Spanish is the language of the soul.'' **********Hispanic agencies will be needed for English ads as well, she added, because of the cultural nuances. **********Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, agrees that the Hispanic population will continue to have a distinctive culture best appealed to with the aid of Hispanic agencies. But he said the day when English ads for them outnumber those in Spanish could be only 20 years away. **********''The move is going from Spanish to English very fast,'' he said. Of advertisers, he said, ''The population is moving from one to another much faster than they perceive so they're getting left behind.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/29/business/united-health-to-acquire-humana-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1998-05-29", "snippet": "United Healthcare Corp, one of nation's largest health insurers, agrees to acquire Humana Inc for $5.5 billion, further shrinking number of competitors in industry and narrowing choices of managed-care plans for consumers; chart (M)", "word_count": 900, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "United Health To Acquire Humana Inc.", "print_headline": "United Health To Acquire Humana Inc.", "body_text": " **********The United Healthcare Corporation, one of the nation's largest health insurers, agreed yesterday to buy Humana Inc. for $5.5 billion, further shrinking the number of competitors in the industry and narrowing the choices of managed-care plans for consumers. **********The combination of the health plans, with more than 10 million members across the country, would dominate the South Florida market. It would be the strongest insurer in Chicago and some other Midwestern cities. **********Both companies said the agreement would strengthen their ability to offer services that patients want and provide nationwide coverage for big employers. But some health-benefits consultants called such a combination part of a consolidation trend that was unsettling for many Americans in managed-care arrangements. **********''Humana was a very aggressive player,'' said John Erb, a consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., with Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. ''They gave the Blue Cross and United a run for their money. Now, that competition will dry up. There will be diminished choices for employers and consumers.'' **********Both United and Humana recently reported strong financial results, after their success in raising this year's premiums. But like other health insurers, they are under more pressure to produce profits as consumers demand fewer restrictive rules, governments propose tighter regulations, and hospitals and physicians balk at some economizing. **********Managed-care companies also face a squeeze on Government payments for Medicare for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid for low-income people. United Healthcare, based in Minnetonka, Minn., outside Minneapolis, and Humana, of Louisville, Ky., have a combined 902,000 Medicare members and 1.2 million Medicaid members. **********Under the terms of the all-stock deal announced yesterday, United Healthcare would exchange one of its shares for two shares of Humana and assume $850 million of Humana's debt. On the basis of United's closing share price Wednesday of $64.125, before the deal was announced, the value of the stock swap is $5.5 billion. **********United Healthcare shares fell $1.625 yesterday, to $62.50, while Humana's jumped $3.625, to $29.875. **********The agreement is the latest in a series of huge-scale mergers and acquisitions in the health insurance industry. In March, Aetna Inc., which bought U.S. Healthcare for $8.8 billion in 1996, agreed to add the Nylcare health care unit of the New York Life Insurance Company in a $1.35 billion deal. **********Both United and Humana have grown through acquisitions, notably the 1995 purchase by United of Metra Health, itself a combination of units of Metropolitan Life and the Travelers Insurance Company. **********David Jones, a Kentucky entrepreneur, founded Humana with a partner in 1961. They owned nursing homes and later, hospitals. Humana spun off the hospitals in 1993 as a separate company, Galen Health Care Inc., which was later acquired by the chain that became the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. **********Mr. Jones, chairman of Humana, and Dr. William W. McGuire, chairman of United, said the combined company would promote United's ''open access'' health plans, which permit members to consult any specialist from a list approved by United, without approval in advance by their primary doctor. **********Mr. Jones said it would have cost ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' for Humana to duplicate the computerized information systems that United has developed, which make it possible to allow more flexible choices of doctors for consumers while keeping track of physicians' activity, an important cost-control device for managed-care plans. **********Doctors whose costs for patients are deemed excessive ''can be identified and counseled,'' Mr. Jones said. **********Dr. McGuire said profit margins were narrow in health insurance, while the demand for more capital was increasing. ''You've got to have strong organizations,'' he said. **********The two companies combined would have 602,000 members in health maintenance organizations in Miami, or 48 percent of that market, according to Interstudy, a nonprofit managed-care research center in Minneapolis. Dr. McGuire said United and Humana would have 1.4 million customers in all types of health care in Florida, or less than 10 percent of the state's estimated 14.7 million people. **********In the Chicago market for health maintenance organizations, United and Humana would have a 28 percent share, ahead of H.M.O. Illinois, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, with 24 percent, Interstudy said. **********Under the deal, Mr. Jones would have 4.5 million shares of United Healthcare and a seat on the United board. No new positions were immediately announced for Gregory H. Wolf, chief executive of Humana, or other Humana executives. **********Security analysts said the lesser role for Humana officials could mean less of the clash of cultures that has hampered many deals. ''The track record for mergers in this sector is less than stellar,'' said Rob Maines, an analyst with Advest Inc. Analysts said it had taken a year to 18 months for several health care companies to get back on their feet after big merger deals. **********Dr. McGuire said the Humana acquisition would bring eventual savings of $100 million to $250 million by eliminating overlapping administrative costs and ''a couple hundred million'' through efficiencies in medical care, including $100 million from lower payments to hospitals. **********The combined company, with headquarters near Minneapolis, would start with 50,000 employees before shedding an unspecified number. **********In the transaction, Goldman, Sachs & Company and the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell advised United Healthcare.

So far it is unclear whether the crew had accurate maps and altitude information when it struck the cable. **********The accident happened last Tuesday, when an EA-6B Prowler, a Marine Corps electronic surveillance plane, sliced ski lift cables near Cavalese in the Dolomite Mountains. All 20 passengers in a ski lift car were killed when the gondola fell to the ground. **********The plane's pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby of the Marines, told defense lawyers that the plane's altitude measurement equipment appeared to be malfunctioning. But experts said such equipment would have been of little use at very low altitudes, meaning that the crew would have had to rely on the human eye to spot the cable. **********Until today, the focus of the investigation into the accident was the jet's mission recorder, which keeps track of speed, altitude and route. United States Air Force officials said today that software experts from the recorder's American manufacturer were on their way to Italy after investigators were unable to retrieve all of the recorder's coded data. **********But Francantonio Granero, an Italian prosecutor following the investigation, said the mission recorder's importance receded after the audio tapes were examined. While investigators would not reveal the contents of the tapes, Mr. Granero, speaking by phone from Trento, the capital of the Cavalese region, said experts informed him that ''they now have all the elements necessary to answer the fundamental questions'' about the flight. Such questions might include the jet's precise altitude at the time of the accident and the crew's knowledge of its exact location. **********The tower-to-cockpit tapes contain conversations between the crew and air traffic controllers at Aviano air base and two civilian air fields in northern Italy. Both the plane and the crew returned safely to the Aviano base after cutting the cables. **********The jets from Aviano patrol over Bosnia, but use the mountainous areas of northern Italy as a training ground for low-level flying. The purpose of the exercise when the accident occurred was to practice flying low enough to avoid detection by radar. The four-member crew of the Prowler had been stationed in Aviano since August, and the crew had done at least one previous six-month tour of duty there in 1996. But it remains unclear whether they had ever flown over the area of Cavalese on previous training flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/business/private-sector-what-about-his-dental-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1998-10-25", "snippet": "David A Coulter, who has resigned as BankAmerica Corp president after huge losses, is guaranteed pension equal to 95 percent of his combined 1997 salary until his death; also gets $5.24 million bonus (S)", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "What About His Dental Plan?", "print_headline": "PRIVATE SECTOR; What About His Dental Plan?", "body_text": " **********When David A.
