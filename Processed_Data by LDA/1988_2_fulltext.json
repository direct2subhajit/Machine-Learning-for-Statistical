The four parties generally described as fundamentalist are more powerful than the three so-called moderate parties and set the tone of the movement. **********Differences between the two groupings deepened today when the leader of one of the moderate parties, Sibghatullah al-Mojaddedi, announced his resignation from the alliance and the party leadership. He said in an interview that he resisted the urging of the four fundamentalist parties to announce an interim government to be headed by Ahmed Shah, an official from one of them. Pakistan Urges Interim Rule **********An aide said the Pakistani Interservices Intelligence, the agency that manages Pakistan's relations with the insurgents and distributes the arms supplied by other countries, notably the United States, had pressed Mr. Mojaddedi to agree to the Government. **********In the indirect Geneva negotiations between Pakistan and the Afghan regime, Pakistan insists that an interim Government be named to guarantee peace while the Soviet troops withdraw. **********Mr. Mojaddedi said Pakistan favored the fundamentalist parties, particularly in the distribution of arms. Asked whether his stand would deprive the guerrillas that support him of arms, he replied: ''It's up to Pakistan. They are responsible to God.'' **********The moderates, none of whom would favor secular government in the Western sense, say they believe that the fundamentalists' goals are to establish an Islamic regime more radical than any in pre-Communist Afghanistan. They say that the aim of the radical ''Islamists'' is not only to undo the attempt to impose Communism, which led to civil war and the Soviet move into Afghanistan in December 1979, but also to reverse the social modernization that preceded the overthrow of King Mohammad Zahir Shah in 1973. Zealotry Is Feared **********The moderates say the fundamentalists intend to install a regime of religious zealotry, which would be marked by the total isolation of women from education and public life, the strict application of Islamic law and the hampering of modern economic activity by subjecting it to the restrictions on finance imposed by the Koran. **********They fear that such an Afghanistan would turn away from the Western world that has supported the insurgents and on which they count for the rehabilitation of their country. **********But while the fundamentalists express their views fully - and appear to be enjoying the support of the Government of Pakistan - the moderates speak their minds freely only when assured of anonymity. **********In the villas and compounds occupied by the leaders of the alliance parties -where visitors must shake hands in Afghan style with many an armed guard and inquisitive aide before being admitted - virtually identical views are expressed for publication. Murder of Professor **********The divergence between privately held and publicly expressed views has been greatly heightened, according to Afghans and Westerners close to the exiles, since the murder Feb. 11 of Prof. Syed Majrooh at his home and office in Peshawar. Professor Majrooh headed the Afghan Information Center, which had won a reputation for objective reporting. **********The United States Government, as well as private Western sources, financed the center's work. **********In public, the unsolved assassination is attributed to agents of the Kabul regime. Privately, however, some moderate Afghans and Westerners say they believe strongly that the former dean of literature at Kabul University had been made to pay the price for long giving offense to the most militant fundamentalists. **********His last published survey reported that about 70 percent of Afghan refugees favored a solution under the moderate leadership of the former king, now in exile in Italy. A Western analyst said that at his death, Professor Majrooh had been preparing to publish a report saying that the most militantly fundamentalist leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, was steadily losing ground in his party. The King and His Reign **********Asked whether he shared the suspicion against the fundamentalists, Mr. Mojaddedi replied: ''Perhaps. Many people are assassinated by them.'' **********To the fundamentalists, as well as their Pakistani backers, mention of Zahir Shah's return in any role is anathema. To the Afghans, the King's 40-year reign was marked by a yielding of Islam to modernism; to Pakistan, he recalls years of bilateral tension, a leaning toward India and the only vote cast in the United Nations in 1947 against the admission of Pakistan. **********No Afghan leader here supports the King openly. ''Professor Majrooh was the only one who transmitted the true message of Afghanistan to the world,'' one moderate said. ''For that he was murdered.'' **********In the moderate view, the fundamentalist parties are striving to submerge national tradition and social values through an all-embracing creed comparable to the militant Islam of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in neighboring Iran. They say this is so despite the fact that Iran's dominant faith is Shiite Islam, while in Afghanistan Sunni Moslems make up 80 percent of the population. An Open Threat Is Seen **********Moderates see evidence for this view in a virtually open threat last month by Mr. Hekmatyar to continue the war from Iran if Pakistan signs an accord in Geneva that does not assure the rights of the resistance groups as the fundamentalists define them. **********''The war is not just for religion but for national liberty as well,'' a moderate party official said. ''The three moderate parties are also basically religious parties, but they see the Afghan as a deeply religious man of traditional faith. It is the religion, tradition and social values that make up Afghan identity.'' **********''When you talk of the Afghan nation, you are accused of not being Islamic, an unaffiliated Afghan intellectual said. ''They say Islam has no borders.'' **********All of the resistance parties demand the creation of an ''Islamic'' government. The term is variously defined. **********''The fundamentalists' view of 'Islamic' is to let religious extremists take over,'' another moderate party official said. ''If we don't achieve some ingredients of modernity in post-Russian-withdrawal Afghanistan, we are entering into a very dark age.'' **********The official, like many others, cited particularly regression in the gains made by women and in civil liberties under the monarchy. ''We had women in Parliament, in the university, a very large number in the administration, and female education had begun even in the remotest parts of the country,'' he said. **********Moderate Afghans of both sexes, as well as foreigners working among the three million refugees in Pakistan, said that in exile women were being forced by fundamentalist pressure into extreme segregation and repression."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/11/business/patents-fire-resistant-process-for-blends-of-fabric.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1988-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 217, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fire-Resistant Process For Blends of Fabric", "print_headline": "PATENTS; Fire-Resistant Process For Blends of Fabric", "body_text": " **********Many consumers recall the controversy in the 1970's over Tris, a flame-retardant chemical used in textiles.

Miller, Attorney General of Iowa, who is the first vice president of the organization, said that increased activity by state law-enforcement officials against national advertising they deemed fraudulent had resulted from the Federal Government's lax enforcement of existing regulations. **********''It seems to us that at a time when resources available to the Federal Trade Commission are decreasing and issues relating to advertising are increasing, there is a role for states to play,'' Mr. Miller said at the meeting, held at the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan. **********In response, Terry Calvani, an F.T.C. commissioner and an opponent of many attempts by states to regulate national advertising, accused the attorneys general of acting ''like frustrated writers who want to try their own hands at writing copy.'' **********The debate took place at the annual meeting of the National Advertising Review Board, the industry's self-regulatory body, before an audience of several dozen representatives of advertising trade associations and marketing executives from numerous large companies. **********The attorneys general's group has led recent efforts by the states to regulate interstate commerce, using antitrust suits and legislation, to fill a breach they say has been created by the Reagan Administration's endeavors at deregulation. In January it issued guidelines regulating the content of airline advertising. Recently it proposed a new set of rules governing car-rental advertising. **********Advertisers and their representatives say that the work of the attorneys general is making the task of developing informative advertising difficult. **********''You can't have Balkanization,'' said Daniel L. Jaffe, senior vice president of the Association of National Advertisers. ''You can't have 50 states with 50 different rules.'' **********At yesterday's debate and discussion, several advertising representatives said that state regulation would ultimately result in less information reaching the consumer. **********Wallace S. Snyder, senior vice president for government relations at the American Advertising Federation, said proposals requiring ads to list all restrictions and limitations on airline fares or automobile prices were impossible in a 30-second television commercial. **********He quoted Daniel Oliver, F.T.C. chairman, to the effect that the recent airline ad guidelines inhibit price competition because they induce the airlines to eliminate all fare information from ads, rather than face prosecution. **********Mr. Miller, a Democrat first elected in 1978, responded that the guidelines enhance price competition. He called airline advertising emphasizing fares that are unavailable to most consumers ''the old bait-and-switch technique gone high tech.'' He also criticized car-rental ads that compare base rental prices without including additional, mandatory fees, calling them ''price advertising that is not real price advertising.'' **********Advertisers say they would prefer the F.T.C. to take the lead again in regulating advertising. But Mr. Calvani, who was appointed to the commission in 1983 by President Reagan, said, ''Beware the F.T.C.!'' **********He dismissed nostalgia for the ''good old days,'' reminding his audience of several cases heard by the commission in the 1970's. In one, manufacturers of automatic sewing machines were told to put disclaimers on the machines because the commission felt the word ''automatic'' would confuse consumers into believing that they could be turned on and would sew clothes without guidance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/home-resale-rise-is-1.1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Resale Rise Is 1.1%", "print_headline": "Home Resale Rise Is 1.1%", "body_text": " **********Sales of existing homes rose 1.1 percent in November, the biggest increase since August, a real estate trade group reported today. **********The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 million units in November.

If the answer is no, families are sent to local health centers for counseling and vaccinations. **********Largely as a result of the door-to-door program, which has its roots in a national vaccination campaign launched more than a decade ago, the percentage of immunized children in the 1-year-old to 2-year-old range has risen to 90 percent, from 34 percent six years ago, according to health statistics. About 200 children are vaccinated each day. In addition, the infant mortality rate has dropped to about 77 for each 1,000 babies, from an estimated 108 for each 1,000 babies in 1980. Program Struggles But Survives **********The success of the vaccination program, which was helped by the United Nations Children's Fund and which has progressed despite chronic nationwide shortages of medical supplies, was similar to that of one involving pre-natal care. Nearly all pregnant women here now receive such assistance, and 90 percent of all births in Maputo now take place in hospitals. **********Officials of this city of more than one million people suggest that the statistics highlight a long-standing commitment by the nation's sole political party, the Mozambique Liberation Front, to improving the health of the people. After independence from Portugual in 1975, health care was nationalized and treatment was given virtually free of charge. The party, then led by President Samora M. Machel, a former nurse, adopted a policy that gave priority to preventive health care. Mr. Machel died in a plane crash last year. 'So Few Medicines' **********''We are a poor country,'' said Dr. Oscar Monteiro, the director of Maputo's Center for Preventive Medicine. ''There are few medicines, few supplies, few hospitals. So we have to diminish the number of patients. That's why we emphasize preventive care. **********''What we are doing in Maputo is what we want to do in the whole country. Unfortunately, the bandits and South Africa won't let us.'' **********Dr. Monteiro was referring to the Mozambique National Resistance, the rebel movement that is seen here as a surrogate of South Africa. The guerrillas have for 12 years been waging a war against the Mozambican Government. The conflict, being played out largely in the countryside, has created levels of malnutrition and infant mortality that are among the highest in the world. About 6.5 million of Mozambique's 14 million people require some international food aid; 3.2 million of them are dependent on emergency food. **********Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move, fleeing the conflict, and just as many are threatened by starvation because the war has disrupted their subsistence farming. Millions Reported Cut Off **********A report by the Mozambique Health Ministry said that the destruction of health facilities by the rebels, popularly known as Renamo or the M.N.R., and the displacement of rural Mozambicans had cut off more than two million people from health services. The rebels have used dynamite and mortars to destroy more than 30 percent of the country's health centers and have looted hundreds of others. They have ambushed ambulances and killed health workers. The report said at least 21 health workers had been killed, another 44 abducted and 431 robbed of their suppplies in rebel attacks. **********The United Nations Children's Fund said the conflict, one of Africa's grimmest and most prolonged, pushed the mortality rate among children under the age of 5 to as many as 375 per 1,000 in 1986. The rate was 182 for each 1,000 in 1980. The war resulted in the death of 320,000 children from 1981 to 1986, the agency reported. The view here is that many of the deaths were due to malnutrition and preventable diseases that could have been cured had health facilities been functioning. The Disruptions of War **********The war has also disrupted parts of Maputo's health care system. Patients have been kidnapped and supplies stolen, health officials say, resulting in two of the city's eight centers with maternity wards now being closed each night. The closings have caused a drop in the number of women giving birth in such facilities, according to these sources, which could foreshadow a rise in infant and maternal deaths. **********Displaced people are streaming into the city from outlying areas in search of safety, stretching already limited resources. ''The whole country is in crisis,'' Dr. Monteiro said. ''That can't help but be reflected in Maputo.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/23/business/stock-exchange-plan-for-halt-in-trading-widely-criticized.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1988-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1904, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Exchange Plan for Halt In Trading Widely Criticized", "print_headline": "Stock Exchange Plan for Halt In Trading Widely Criticized", "body_text": " **********As the stock market went into its chaotic tailspin last Oct. 19, the New York Stock Exchange struggled to keep trading open and preserve a bedrock principle: that the exchange provides a marketplace where investors can always buy or sell stocks at fairly determined prices during operating hours. **********Protecting that principle of liquidity became a source of great pride for the exchange. But now, in a remarkable philosophical shift, the New York exchange is nearing an agreement with other exchanges and Government officials on a plan that would halt trading in times of stress. This ''circuit breaker'' would shut the markets temporarily if they swung too widely, with moves of 150 to 300 points on the Dow Jones industrial average being discussed. **********But few market experts, including most of those devising the circuit breaker plan, see it as a meaningful tool to prevent a future stock market crash. The circuit breaker, these leaders say, could prove a counterproductive response to the market flaws exposed by last October's crash. **********''I think this will scare what few small investors are left away from the market,'' said Roberta S. Karmel, a member of the exchange's board and former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Clearly, some people like this because it is a catchy phrase that the public can understand easily. But the point is that closing the market is an admission of market failure. It is not fixing anything. This is being done because it is the politically expedient thing to do.'' Complex and Thorny Issues **********At the least, the experts said, the measures may mislead the public into believing that a cure-all has been found, when the industry is far from agreeing on substantive solutions to other complex and politically thorny issues that might do more to restore stock market integrity. **********Even John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York exchange, who took part in the discussions, expressed deep misgivings. ''This may have some value in giving everyone a breather, but this is no cure-all,'' he said. ''It's become a very trendy thing to talk about circuit breakers.'' **********He said the proposal resulted largely from a desire by Wall Street and Government officials to demonstrate to the public that they are taking some kind of action to bolster the market system in the wake of the October crash. **********''One of my problems is that, if you decide to close down markets at 75 points or 100 points or 150 points, you tend to give people the idea that the markets are safe, that there is no risk,'' Mr. Phelan said. ''But they aren't, they are full of risks.'' The exchanges cannot eliminate the risks by simply halting business in times of stress, he said. **********Among the plan's backers is Leo Melamed, a senior official at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the principal market for trading stock index futures contracts. But even he is lukewarm to the circuit breaker concept, seeing it as a first step to getting a meaningful revamping under way. **********He said a shutdown was not an ideal solution, but added: ''It is not a small item. It is high on my list of priorities. The point is that if we can get by this issue, we can get to some of those other issues.'' **********Some experts fear that shutting down a runaway market - an experiment never tried in America's modern market system - could add to the panic of investors. They would suddenly find themselves holding securities of uncertain value with no ready way of trading them. **********In recent weeks, Mr. Phelan and Mr. Melamed have come close to agreement with other industry and Government leaders on a plan to stop all securities trading temporarily in a coordinated fashion after a threshold level is crossed. **********Some of the leading stock trading houses on Wall Street have said they worry that a circuit breaker may do more harm than good. **********''We are certainly not in favor of closing down trading because that will just make people more fearful,'' said John L. Steffens, president of the consumer markets division of Merrill, Lynch & Company, the nation's largest retail broker. **********Merrill Lynch, like other retail firms, has seen its business decline sharply since the crash because of the withdrawal of shellshocked individual investors who have lost confidence in the stock market. 'Getting the Ambulance Ready' **********''What this is doing is getting the ambulance ready to speed to the scene of the accident,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, which is holding hearings into market revamping issues. ''They are doing this rather than looking at things like bringing down the speed limits and other steps to make the markets themselves safer.'' **********There are several reasons why, experts say, a shutdown would not necessarily stop a crash. First, even if the market were closed after falling the limit, there would be nothing to stop it from continuing to descend just as swiftly when trading resumed if sellers continued to dominate. **********Second, traders say that there could be a ''gravitational'' effect, in which investors would rush in to sell even more heavily as the Dow average moved toward its limit in an effort to get out of the market while it was still functioning. This pressure could so swamp the market that when it did reopen the first trade would be already at a significantly lower level. An Out-of-Control Market **********What frightened both the public and Wall Street professionals last Oct. 19, when the Dow average plunged an unprecedented 508 points, was not just the fall but how it raced so out of control. The crisis threatened on Oct. 20 to spill over into the financial and banking systems. **********Regulators and Congress were concerned that only ad hoc measures helped restore order last October and that there were no established contingency plans to manage the crisis. **********In theory, the circuit breakers will calm emotions and restore balance when the market grows disorderly. A Presidential task force that studied the market plunge and issued recommendations in January suggested that some kind of circuit breaker be adopted as part of a market revamping package. **********The task force, known as the Brady commission, also recommended fundamental change in margin requirements, or the amount of money investors may borrow when buying securities, and in the system for making sure that buyers pay for their securities and sellers receive their proceeds. **********In addition, the task force called for coordinating the current patchwork regulatory system and giving one body overall authority for guiding the various regulators. **********The S.E.C. also issued a major study of the crash that jolted many with its descriptions of the powerful influence stock index futures contracts exert over the stock market. Effect of Program Trading **********Industry experts are still grappling with means to try to bridle the enormous power unleashed by the interplay between these two markets. This interplay is often referred to as program trading. **********Each of these are highly charged issues. Washington and Wall Street are split over them. Battles have broken out between different exchanges, regulatory agencies and their backers in Congress. **********Nicholas F. Brady, the co-chairman of Dillon, Read & Company and a former United States Senator who was chosen by President Reagan to head his task force, expressed frustration over the lack of progress. **********''What I see are turf battles,'' Mr. Brady said. ''What I don't see are measures that will really help the end-users in the market.'' **********Joseph A. Grundfest, an S.E.C. commissioner, said more time should be spent on issues such as building the capital behind the market system and adding to the liquidity of the stock market. Circuit breakers are the ''last step that should be taken, not the first one,'' he said. **********Some steps have been taken. The Merc has adopted a price limit of 15 points on its Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures contract, equal to a move of about 120 points in the Dow average. Under this new rule, trading in the stock index future contract, representing the value of a basket of 500 stocks, does not stop when the 15-point range is reached, but it cannot move beyond that barrier. **********Mr. Melamed also pointed out that a number of technical changes had been instituted piecemeal. **********For instance, investors in stock index futures contracts must now put down 15 percent of the value of the contract in cash, up from 7 percent earlier. The Merc's private clearing house has set up a new system for collecting and distributing margin deposits to investors during the trading session. And an improved communication network has been established between the different futures clearing houses. **********Mr. Phelan conceded that a circuit breaker already instituted at the New York exchange - a shutdown of the use of an electronic stock order system for certain kinds of program trading whenever the market rises or falls more than 50 points in a day -was of minimal effectiveness. **********''This is a way of saying that we are concerned about the problem of volatility,'' Mr. Phelan remarked of the 50-point rule. ''This is not even a circuit breaker, though; when the market is active you hardly notice it.'' **********It apparently did little when the stock market plunged 101 points on April 14. Many program traders found ways to execute their trades without using the electronic system. Specialist Capital Increased **********The New York exchange has initiated some other steps toward revamping. It has sharply increased the amount of capital that specialists, who make markets in the individual stocks traded on the exchange floor, must maintain relative to the amount of stock they buy and sell. This will provide the specialists more of a cushion against violent market moves. The exchange is also spending millions of dollars to enhance its computers and expand the market's daily trading capacity. **********One of the things that has made the American market system so powerful, many argue, is how effectively it has provided liquidity to investors. Halting trading - drying up the liquidity - just as throngs of investors are pouring into the market to buy or sell their stock could exacerbate any panic, some warn. **********The stock exchange in Hong Kong faced this problem when it was shut down during the crash last October. It was only set back in operation after two costly financial bailouts led by major banks and the Government. **********Mr. Phelan conceded that the whole question of how, step by step, the market would be restarted after a closing remained unanswered. **********''That issue has not been addressed,'' he said. But, he added, ''If you have a real crescendo of selling, anyone who thinks you're going to get it to stop with a systemic pause is crazy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/business/executive-changes-722388.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Applied Power Inc., Milwaukee, a maker of hydraulic equipment, elected its president and chief executive, Richard G.

The Chrysler Corporation took 18.3 percent, up 2.2 points, and the General Motors Corporation took 42 percent, down 7.5 points. **********It was the sixth consecutive 10-day reporting period to exceed last year's results, a showing that analysts have attributed to aggressive discounting by the Big Three manufacturers and the unexpected rebound from October's stock market crisis. 'Stronger Than I Expected' **********''Over all, the numbers are stronger than I expected,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''My old forecast was that sales would be flat, but now I think this year will be better than last year.'' **********Mr. Healy said he expected incentives to continue, in one form or another, if only to justify the increased production that the Big Three have recently announced. **********Car and light-truck sales averaged 36,493 units a day during the nine selling days of the March 1-10 period, compared with 34,328 units a day during the eight selling days of last year's period.

It includes not only clusters of stone-throwing youths along the roadsides, but also committees smuggling food into sealed-off refugee centers, medical workers giving first aid to wounded protesters, women's groups knitting the uniform blue sweaters allowed prisoners and, significantly in the last few days, businessmen's committees coordinating shop openings and symbolic strikes. All Factions Said to Agree **********''We began working about two weeks after the uprising started,'' said a member of the secret national leadership, seemingly oblivious to an Israeli Army jeep rumbling past his grimy storefront window in a West Bank town. He added that ''the important thing now is that we have the agreement and accountability of all factions'' of the P.L.O. **********''Now we are directing the leadership outside,'' he said, referring to the P.L.O. officials in Tunis and Baghdad who have been scrambling to keep up with events in the streets here. **********The clandestine organization's main method of communication is leaflets passed hand to hand on the streets signed, ''P.L.O. - National Unified Leadership of the Uprising.'' The leaflets, usually giving outlines of strikes or other tactics, are now eagerly awaited and obeyed. 'The Whole World Has Heard' **********''Let the war of stones and flags and firebombs increase,'' urged Leaflet 6, which began circulating a few days ago. ''The whole world has heard your voice. During the next weeks we want the marches and demonstrations to continue, burning tires in the streets and throwing stones and firebombs on the heads of the occupiers.'' **********The current leaflet calls for strikes on Sunday and Monday ''marking the second month of the uprising and in honor of the first martyrs,'' the resignation of Israeli-appointed municipal councils, and refusal to pay the Israeli value-added tax - a 15 percent surcharge on every business transaction - as a prelude to forcing the Israelis to cancel all taxes. **********What has astonished not only Israeli officials, but also Palestinians themselves, is that the protests, in which 43 Palestinians have been shot dead, are continuing and seemingly feeding on themselves. **********''We were surprised,'' an Israeli Army officer said ruefully, ''almost as surprised as the P.L.O.'' **********Israeli officials concede that they expect the protests to continue for months. **********They began spontaneously in the Gaza Strip on Dec. 9, after the deaths of four Palestinians in a crash with a car driven by an Israeli. **********A factor in the timing of the outburst, Palestinians say, was the Arab summit meeting in Amman, Jordan, in November, in which Arab leaders set aside the Palestinian issue. **********''The people gave up on the outside helping us,'' said a Palestinian youth in the tiny West Bank village of Beit Furik, one of the previously quiet places the unrest has reached. ''At the Amman conference, the Arabs said they were united for the gulf but not interested in our problem.'' **********As the demonstrations in Gaza continued, rivalry between Islamic fundamentalists and Palestinian leftists, which had included severe beatings less than two years ago, eased. Mosques became rallying points because of the loudspeakers in their minarets. The protests took a more sophisticated political turn by keeping from work the roughly 60,000 Gaza Palestinians who commute to low-paying jobs vital to Israel's economy. Started as Food Gathering **********A turning point, Palestinian organizers say, came early in January, when the Israeli Army began using the tactic of sealing off the refugee centers in the Gaza Strip and putting them under round-the-clock curfew - meaning no one could venture outdoors - to halt the protests. **********Grassroots committees sprang up to gather food from local farmers and smuggle it into the refugee centers. **********The idea spread among P.L.O. supporters in the West Bank and elsewhere, not only as a way of keeping the protest going, but also as a means of political mobilization for its own sake. **********The national leadership committee that evolved, the member of the secret committee and other Palestinians said, is made up of one representative each from five major Palestinian factions. The five factions are Al Fatah, the organization loyal to Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O.; three leftist organizations - the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Communist Party -and Islamic Holy War, the Moslem fundamentalist group. Fatah Is Listening Now **********''Fatah is the strongest,'' said the leader, who is a member of another faction. ''Its member has more weight. Everything is ultimately in the hands of Fatah, but what is different now is that they are listening to our suggestions. **********''But we don't make demands that people won't follow,'' he said. ''We know the pulse of the street.'' **********The organization is now well financed with money channeled both from the P.L.O. abroad and wealthy local supporters, Palestinians said. **********''Every meeting is in a different house, never in the same place,'' the clandestine leader said. **********''The representative is not necessarily the top man of each faction; usually it is the No. 2,'' he said. ''But what is very important is that the person has the authority to speak for the faction. We have round-the-clock committees to protect these five.'' **********From the national committee, the leaflets and other instructions are passed down to local committees at the neighborhood and street levels. **********These committees are organized according to the geographic strength of the factions. Islamic Holy War, which is not linked with the Lebanese Shiite organization that has claimed kidnappings, is strong in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources say. Fatah is strong among the middle class on the West Bank. **********A young organizer in the Jalazone refugee center, alluding to the factionalism that plagued the Palestinians in the past, said, ''The reason for including all the factions is so that no one group can take all the power or money, or accuse the other groups of doing it.'' Infrastructure Was in Place **********''The important thing,'' the underground leader said, ''is that a grass- roots infrastructure was already in existence. Unions, women's committees, every faction had its own infrastructure.'' **********The most important of such organizations, Palestinian sources said, was the Shabiba, or Youth Movement, which was ostensibly set up as a community service organization cleaning cemeteries or repairing drainage in refugee centers, but which in reality served as a nationalist organizing device for Fatah. **********The National Union of Palestinian Working Women was another key group. It had spent years giving hygiene classes and organizing nurseries and other activities aimed at women, while at the same time trying to foster Palestinian nationalism. **********''Women are playing a very major role,'' the underground leader said. ''For example, women are organizing Palestinian women who work in Israeli factories so that when we are ready to call a strike, it will be effective. Women are organized so that whenever a youth is grabbed by the soldiers, they will all start shrieking and try to get him away. They are very disciplined.'' **********But Israeli tactics also appear to have helped spread the protest organization. There is scarcely a Palestinian who has not felt some measure of the Israeli repression, from women confined to their homes by curfew to merchants who have their doors pried open by the troops. Each humiliation, the Palestinians say, is building hatred. **********Fear - of jail, of the army, even of the new tactic of beatings - has also been broken down by the experience of the last few weeks, both Israelis and Palestinians say. Palestinian youths consider a prison term a badge of honor. **********''The jails are our universities,'' a Palestinian lawyer said one day outside the grim, military headquarters in Nablus, surrounded by barbed wire, where some of the 2,000 or so people arrested were being rushed through military trials. ''If someone goes in blind, he comes out with a hundred eyes.'' Revolutionary Shopkeepers **********One of the major recent developments has been the organizing of businessmen's committees, turning people like the wealthy shopkeepers of the market town of Ramallah into bourgeois revolutionaries. **********The businessmen, who are preparing to demand an end to Israeli taxation, over the last few days have devised opening hours that leave their areas bustling madly for three hours a day and slammed shut on the dot of closing time in a symbolic strike. **********The strike, in which businessmen have cut off their own profits, has been one of the stranger tactics. But rather than let the stores stay closed, the Israeli Army has pried the doors open with crowbars. **********Ultimately, the new leadership is challenging not only the Israelis, but the established local notables like Mayor Elias Freij of Bethlehem and conservative institutions like chambers of commerce tolerated by both Israel and Jordan. **********''The stock of the P.L.O. factions has risen,'' the underground leader said. ''No one has ever seen us united before.'' **********''But in a way, it is the suffering caused by the Israelis that has done it,'' he said. ''Now people are following the leadership, following the instructions in the leaflets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/business/company-news-investors-disclose-talks-on-scherer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Investors Disclose Talks on Scherer", "print_headline": "Company News; Investors Disclose Talks on Scherer", "body_text": " **********Two New York-based investment firms that hold the equivalent of an 8.8 percent stake in the R.

Importance of Stability Noted **********''A stable dollar has been the glue that has held the financial markets together this year,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''But until the President, the President-elect or the Treasury Secretary makes a clear statement supporting the dollar, and leading central banks intervene to back it up, the dollar may continue to slip. **********''And a further drop in the dollar would have a devastating effect on the stock and bond markets, and substantially raise the possibility of a recession next year.'' **********While concerned, other analysts were not putting quite so much emphasis on the significance of the dollar's recent drop, which at the end of last week left it just above the all-time lows reached against the Japanese yen in December and early January. Possible Effect on Rates **********''We aren't sowing the seeds for another market meltdown,'' said John Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''But the weaker dollar and a growing recognition that the economy is not slowing down sufficiently to bring inflation down are combining to lay the foundation for higher interest rates.'' **********The dollar has re-emerged as a source of real uncertainty because its decline over the last two weeks has been met with only token resistance from central banks and comments from Government officials who have limited credibility in the foreign exchange markets. **********The tepid official reaction has in turn sparked talk that the Bush Administration will favor a lower dollar as the best way to further reduce the nation's merchandise trade deficit. A lower dollar might improve the trade picture somewhat, but it would also raise expectations about future inflation. Dollar No Help to Bond Market **********The dollar's performance last week did nothing to help the bond market, and it soured the Treasury's refunding auctions. **********Fixed-income traders in the United States were not at their desks on Friday because of the Veterans' Day holiday. But traders overseas were sellers of Treasury securities, and by the time markets in Europe closed, the yield on the Treasury's 9 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2018 stood at 9.04 percent. **********At the close of business on Nov. 3, the day before a stronger-than-expected employment report from the Labor Department was released, the yield on the closely watched issue stood at 8.75 percent. Impact on Short-Term Rates **********Long-term rates were not the only ones that felt the imact of the drop in the dollar. **********Three-month Treasury bill rates, for instance, rose by 20 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the course of the week, to an offered rate of 7.66 percent. **********''The equity market is prey to a weaker dollar,'' Mr. Kudlow said, ''because rising short-term interest rates create competition for stocks. I find this greatly troubling.'' **********Market participants are likely to be informed today by the Treasury that $9 billion worth of a new 30-year issue will be auctioned, perhaps later in the week. **********The Treasury did not include the 30-year issue as part of last week's auctions because President Reagan had not yet signed tax legislation that authorized the department to sell new bonds. In the wake of last week's developments, the delay turned out to be auspicious for the Treasury. 'Brilliant or Awfully Lucky' **********''The Treasury was either awfully brilliant or awfully lucky to leave the 30-year out of those auctions,'' said Robert Ried, president of Ried, Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm based in Westport, Conn. ''The market would have been in even worse shape if that issue had been auctioned.'' **********If merchandise trade numbers to be released Wednesday are in line with current forecasts, bond prices and the dollar could receive a bit of favorable treatment this week, even without a firm policy statement from Washington. **********The consensus estimate among economists is that September's trade deficit shrank from the $12.2 billion shortfall recorded in August, to $10.6 billion, or perhaps slightly less. Narrower Deficit Projected **********Armed with nine months of figures, most analysts are projecting that the deficit will narrow by about $30 billion this year, from the record $170 billion recorded in 1987. **********Similar gains are highly unlikely next year, however, even if the dollar falls further. **********Elliott Platt, chief economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, writes in the firm's weekly economic commentary that the deficit will contract by only another $10 billion in 1989. That forecast assumes the dollar will fall to 115 yen and 1.65 West German marks by the end of next year, Mr. Platt said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/25/business/dow-plunges-43.77-points-to-2023.87.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1988-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1003, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Plunges 43.77 Points, To 2,023.87", "print_headline": "Dow Plunges 43.77 Points, To 2,023.87", "body_text": " **********Stock prices plummeted yesterday in a broad decline that analysts linked to various factors, including a sharp drop in the dollar's value and worry over interest rates. **********A wave of computerized program selling contributed to the market's drop, and by the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 43.77 points, or 2.1 percent, finishing at 2,023.87.

A falling dollar raises fears that interest rates will have to rise to bolster the dollar's value and to keep dollar-denominated investments attractive to investors. **********Recent rises in the price of oil and other commodities have also added to the inflation concerns, along with economic reports showing continued growth in the nation's economy. **********''The combined weight of increased oil prices, the weakening U.S. dollar and higher interest rates heightened investors' fears that a more inflationary environment may be at hand,'' said Bernard Spilko, managing director of Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer. **********Mr. Spilko said that the market would need time to ''lick its wounds'' and that second-quarter earnings reports would become the main focus for providing any upward impetus for stocks. Early Selling Pressure **********In yesterday's session, the stock market was under selling pressure right from the opening bell as the dollar, which began to fall against the Japanese yen in Tokyo foreign-exchange trading, continued to decline in New York dealings. **********By the end of the first hour of stock trading, the Dow was off almost 30 points. With the weakness in stocks, futures traders in Chicago began selling stock-index futures contracts. That caused arbitragers to begin buying the cheaper futures and selling stocks in the cash market, causing a further erosion of stock prices. **********After declining steadily until midday, the stock market recovered slightly but faltered again near the close. **********Market experts said the Big Board's 50-point limit appeared to have worked, first by causing futures sellers to back off, and then by getting stock buyers to step in. **********Exchange officials and brokerage industry executives agreed to adopt the limit in February to try to restore confidence in the stock market, which had been eroded by October's stunning collapse and the subsequent volatility in prices. Approaching the Limit **********Yesterday was the fourth day since Feb. 10 that the Dow has approached the 50-point limit. The Dow was up 47 points on Feb. 10, up 48 points on Feb. 29 and off 48 points on March 10. **********Still, brokers warned that the limit could prove to be a false security blanket. If the Dow fall below the 50-point limit, member firms could execute index-arbitrage trades manually. In index arbitrage, traders seek to take advantage of the price differences between stock index futures, which reflect the value of a basket of stocks, and the stocks themselves. **********''Watch out for the first time we go through it,'' said Jeffrey S. Tabak, partner at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company, a New York firm that specializes in futures and options. **********The breadth of yesterday's decline was reflected in sharp drops in market averages other than the Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell a sharp 5.56 points, to 263.35, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 2.82 points, to 149.00. **********Market participants said that a Government report on personal income and spending had little effect on the stock market because the data had come in close to expectations. **********Among the blue chips, A.T.&T., the day's volume leader with 6.6 million shares traded, dropped 1/2, to 27 3/4; General Electric dropped 3/4 to 41 7/8; I.B.M. 1 7/8, to 109 3/4, and Digital Equipment 3 3/4, to 107 5/8.

Officials said the meeting did not signal a leadership crisis, although they were at a loss to explain why the gathering was so urgent. **********Mr. Gorbachev met as scheduled in the Kremlin today with the East German leader, Erich Honecker, and was shown on the television news this evening touring an exhibition of industrial machinery with Mr. Honecker and almost all the members of the Politburo. The Soviet leader looked relaxed and no tension with his Kremlin colleagues was evident in the broadcast. **********Mr. Gorbachev, with the reported approval of the Politburo, has planned deep cuts in the party bureaucracy in Moscow and at the regional level, an important step toward limiting the party's role in the management of nearly all aspects of Soviet society. Powerful Interests Threatened **********Although the reorganization plan was approved in general at the special party conference in June, and endorsed by the Central Committee in July, the decision threatens powerful interests in the party and may have provoked strong resistance. **********More than any other decision promoted by Mr. Gorbachev, the move to eliminate nearly half the Central Committee departments and trim the administrative operations of local party organizations cuts to core issues of power and privilege. **********Some Western diplomats here have predicted that Mr. Gorbachev would encounter serious problems by pushing his campaign to reshape the country into the party itself. **********Asked about the prospect of personnel cutbacks as part of the party reorganization, Mr. Gerasimov said today in New York: ''Every cut is serious because it is cutting of personnel. Psychologically it is also very serious because it is really kind of a revolution. But it is part of our reorganization of our political structure with the purpose for this structure to work better than it worked before.'' Hundreds Face Reassignment **********''We want the party to be concerned mainly with strategic thinking and not to interfere, as it does now, in the day-to-day affairs of the Government and the soviets,'' or people's councils, Mr. Gerasimov said at a news conference. **********If the administrative cutbacks proposed by Mr. Gorbachev are carried out, hundreds of high-powered party officials in Moscow would have to be reassigned to new jobs, along with thousands of regional and local party bureaucrats. **********The upheaval would deprive regional and local party leaders - the barons of the Soviet system and the largest voting bloc in the Central Committte - of some of their power and much of the administrative machinery they have used to wield it. **********Georgi K. Kryuchkov, a deputy head of the Central Committee organizational department, said recently that as much as a third of the administrative apparatus of republic and regional party organizations faced elimination under the Gorbachev plan. He said up to half of the Central Committee's 22 departments would be closed. **********The party apparatus in Moscow and around the country has supervised, and often duplicated, government agencies responsible for managing various aspects of the economy, education, science, the press, culture and other elements of Soviet society. Behind Khrushchev's Ouster **********Nikita S. Khrushchev's effort to reorganize the party was one of the main reasons he was ousted as Soviet leader in 1964. **********Mr. Gorbachev said in July that he wanted to put his party reorganization plan into effect this fall. **********If there is strong resistance, he may have felt it wise to seek a renewed endorsement from the Central Committee, including approval of specific steps to carry out the cuts, before proceeding. **********Close to a third of the 300-member Central Committee is composed of republic and regional party leaders. If they have formed into a nucleus of opposition to Mr. Gorbachev, he could face a more serious challenge to his leadership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/17/business/finance-new-issues-receivables-back-sears-unit-s-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Receivables Back Sears Unit's Debt", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Receivables Back Sears Unit's Debt", "body_text": " **********Sears Receivables Financing Group Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company, is offering $500 million of asset-backed securities due in 1993 through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.

Manuel Antonio Noriega. But the general arranged to have Mr. Delvalle removed instead. **********Ambassador Davis, accompanied by Representative Daniel Burton of Indiana, who is visiting here, tried to call on Mr. Delvalle Friday night. They were turned away by policemen. Soon afterward, Mr. Delvalle apparently decided to leave his home. Associates said he slipped out a back door.  [ In a telephone conversation, Mr. Delvalle's wife, Mariella, told Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a leading opposition leader in Washington, that the military officers looking for her husband said that she and her daughter-in-law would remain under house arrest until her husband appeared, Mr. Lewis said. He added that military authorities were not allowing anyone to enter or leave the house.

''It does not reflect any legal reality. I am the President of the Republic of Panama.'' **********Streets were calm in the capital today, and business was normal. Opposition leaders continued efforts to organize a general strike next week. **********The response from other Latin American countries to the confusion here was mixed. El Salvador and Honduras expressed concern at General Noriega's decision to depose the President. The Argentine Government of Raul Alfonsin, which has put down several military uprisings, recalled its ambassador as a sign of protest. But most other Latin countries were silent or issued ambiguous communiques. 'Military Wants Delvalle Out' **********There were reports that Mr. Delvalle would soon leave Panama, perhaps for the United States. Diplomats said General Noriega would probably allow him to depart. **********''The military wants Delvalle out of the country so they won't have to deal with him,'' said a diplomat who has been in contact with senior Panamanian officers. ''That could be a mistake. He'll just fly to Washington and make speeches that will crucify Noriega.'' **********Mr. Delvalle is one of several former associates of General Noriega who have turned against him in recent months. **********Protests crippled the country last summer after the former second-ranking military commander, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, said he had evidence that the general was guilty of corruption and political murder. Trouble Blamed on 'Sedition' **********More recently, the Panamanian Consul in New York, Jose Blandon, resigned from his post and testified at Senate hearings that General Noriega had effectively traded intelligence information to the United States for informal protection against investigations into his alleged crimes. **********Today the pro-military newspaper Critica blamed Panama's difficulties on ''internal and external sedition.'' It also published a front-page photograph of Ambassador Davis under the headline ''Davis, Get Your Hands Off Panama.'' **********General Noriega has charged that American criticism of his rule is part of a campaign to destabilize Panama and restore civilian oligarchs to power. He asserts that the United States is seeking a pretext to retain control of the Panama Canal beyond 1999, when it is scheduled to be turned over to Panamanian control. **********Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement calling on the Government to respect the Constitution and guarantee civil rights, including freedom of the press.

''No matter how hard we try, such an outbreak is likely to happen in the aftermath of a disaster.

Some are distributing clothes and blankets. Several relief camps have been set up in the town, housing more than 500 people.

Others are in schools and religious inns. Some continue to stay in their broken homes. They have no choice.'' Residents say much depends on how soon and how much the Government will assist with loans to build new homes and businesses.

Blandon, who was dismissed as Panama's consul general in New York last month, made the assertion before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee. **********Mr. Blandon's testimony was his fullest declaration of how the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, transformed his country's banks, Government and military institutions, corporations, airstrips and harbors into a ''gigantic machine'' that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in payoffs from drug smugglers and other criminals. Mr. Blandon said the activity began in the early 1970's when General Noriega took over as Panama's intelligence chief. **********The testimony follows General Noriega's indictment last week by two Federal grand juries in Florida on charges of drug trafficking and other crimes. Under Round-the-Clock Guard **********Mr. Blandon, who is under round-the-clock protection by Federal marshals, also said today that as chief of political intelligence until two years ago, he had read classified Panamanian military intelligence reports that described the political beliefs and the personal lives of senators and Congressional staff members. He said the documents identified the source of the information as the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. **********Mr. Blandon said he had received reports on the activities of Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican and a longtime critic of General Noriega, and on Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. **********In one instance in 1986, Mr. Blandon said, he read a report with information purportedly provided by the C.I.A. on Deborah DeMoss, a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who was visiting Panama. It stated that she ''hated'' General Noriega, Mr. Blandon said, and a profile of her appeared shortly afterward in a Panamanian newspaper calling her an American Mata Hari. **********Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who heads the subcommittee, called it reprehensible that reports included details about the private lives of public officials, adding that the handing over of such information was apparently ''part of the ingratiation process, part of the sweetheart relationship'' between General Noriega and the C.I.A. A Denial by the C.I.A. The C.I.A. said in a statement that it ''categorically denies'' furnishing such information to the Government of Panama.

At the same time, he enjoyed a close relationship with the C.I.A. **********Mr. Blandon's allegations of C.I.A. involvement in a cover-up involved the decapitation of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a Noriega opponent, in September 1985. Mr. Blandon said that after the killing, the C.I.A. station chief in Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez, known by the pseudonym Tomas Castillo, sent a ''witness'' known only as Hoffman to Panama where he appeared on television and declared that Salavadoran rebels were behind the killing. **********Mr. Fernandez was later disciplined by the C.I.A. for his involvement in supplying aid to the Nicaraguan rebels while such aid was prohibited by Congress. **********Mr. Hoffman, whom Mr. Blandon described as a specialist in electronics who sometimes worked for the C.I.A., was never questioned by Panamanian law enforcement officials and was whisked out of the country. A Summons by Noriega **********According to the testimony today, General Noriega summoned Mr. Blandon, then his senior political adviser, to his suite at the Helmsley Palace in New York and attributed the murder to Luis Cordoba, now a member of the staff of the joint chiefs of Panama's Defense Forces, which General Noriega commands. Mr. Blandon quoted General Noriega as then saying, ''In any case, he deserved to be dead.'' **********General Noriega has been accused by another high-ranking officer who broke with him of having ordered the murder of Dr. Spadafora, What is motivating Mr. Blandon to speak out remains murky, and some Panamanian opposition leaders believe that if he outlasts General Noriega he may try to run for President in Panama's elections next year. A lifelong politician, he has not joined the Panamanian opposition and today called himself a principal leader of the Government-allied Democratic Revolutionary Party. **********On the charges that C.I.A. files on legislators and staff members were forwarded to Panama, a C.I.A. spokesman said tonight that the agency ''does not engage in this practice.'' **********''Under the law,'' the spokesman added, ''C.I.A. may only collect or retain information on U.S. persons if it has a legitimate foreign intelligence or counterintelligence value.'' **********An Administration official said that there were no restrictions on the agency providing information to foreign governments provided it had been lawfully acquired. **********The White House today rejected a suggestion by General Noriega on Monday that the United States end its extensive military presence in Panama.

The experiment was the second conducted under a verification agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union. **********The previously unreported data, which are classified, suggest that American seismic measurements taken far from the test site were about as accurate in measuring the size of the blast as the on-site verification approach that the United States favors. **********The Administration opposes Congressional ratification of a 1974 treaty that limits the size of underground nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons unless verification of the agreement is improved. **********The United States says each side should have the right to conduct on-site measurements of all blasts greater than 50 kilotons. It favors using a technique called Corrtex, in which a cable is placed in a hole close to the blast. **********But the Russians have argued that only a limited number of on-site measurements should be taken as a way of assuring the accuracy of traditional seismic measurements, which are obtained far from the test site. In a Remote Area **********The test, the last of two, was conducted Sept. 14 at the Semipalatinsk test site, which is in an unpopulated corner of the republic of Kazakhstan, not far from the Chinese border. **********The American measurement process, in the opinion of many, also functioned well in the first experiment, which was conducted in August at the test site in Nevada. But those results were discounted by some Administration officials, who argued that it was not surprising that the seismic estimates were accurate because the United States has extensive knowledge of the geology of its own test site. **********In the Soviet test at Semipalatinsk last month, an American on-site measurement is said to have put the size of the blast at 115 kilotons, while a Soviet on-site measurement estimated it at 122 kilotons. **********But American seismic measurement put the blast at 135 kilotons, once adjustments were made to try to take account of the geological differences between the Soviet and American sites, a Government expert said. **********The expert said that seismic estimates would be even closer to those obtained in the on-site procedure if further refinements in techniques were made to take account of new information supplied by the Russians. As part of an effort to improve verification techniques, the Soviet Union and the United States exchanged data in June on the size of five old nuclear blasts. Administration Defends Stand **********Using the Soviet data, the size of the blast at Semipalatinsk would be estimated at 125 kilotons, the Government official said. A kiloton is equal to the explosive force of 1,000 tons of T.N.T. **********Asked about the results of the experiment, a senior official asserted that the Administration still believed that the on-site approach was the best method. **********Such on-site measurements are ''instrusive and expensive,'' said Troy E. Wade, acting Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs, who declined to discuss specifics. He added: ''But they are the most accurate. If your purpose is verification of testing treaties, this is the way to do it.'' **********Other Government experts say privately that the data from the experiments suggest that seismic estimates, while not exact, can be improved to the point where they would rival the on-site approach in effectiveness. **********Some Administration officials, who favor the on-site approach, concede that such improvements in seismic estimates may be possible. **********In the first experiment, in August in Nevada, American seismic estimating procedures also appeared to perform well. The American blast was said to have in the mid-140 kiloton range. **********An American seismic measurement is said to have put the blast at 139 kilotons, while on-site measurements put it over the 150-kiloton treaty limit. **********An on-site measurement taken by placing a cable in the actual explosion hole measured the blast at 163 kilotons. An on-site measurement in a hole nearby put it at 155 kilotons. The Soviets are said to have estimated the blast through on-site means at 170 kilotons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/business/executive-changes-162388.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Britton Lee Inc., Los Gatos, Calif., a maker and distributor of computer hardware, appointed James B.

Gen. Henri Namphy, to lead his country away from the heavy tradition of dictatorship. **********But as officials deliberate among themselves, they show signs of grasping at straws. As some of them concede, every new idea seems to have less potential than the one before. **********An example is the notion, mentioned by one senior official, that the United States might somehow exploit lethal rivalries among soldiers and thugs to foil General Namphy's plan to hold what the Administration anticipates will be a rigged election on Jan. 17. Outside observers will be barred and authorities will monitor every ballot. The Stick Is Rejected **********''We do want to find something that works,'' said Richard N. Holwill, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Caribbean. ''You can't, at this point, go to Namphy with a stick. We could go with a stick, and everybody would feel good, but it ain't going to change anything.'' **********The stick was wielded Nov. 29, after thugs and soldiers shot at polling places and killed at least 34 Haitians, bringing an end to the country's first effort to conduct a free election. The Administration moved quickly to cut off almost all aid that went directly to the Government, after speedy consultations among Mr. Holwill and Paula Dobriansky, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, who were in Port-au-Prince; Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********But there is no taste for further sanctions. In effect, the Administration has rejected calls by several Haitian opposition politicians that a trade embargo be imposed, that the Government emerging from the coming balloting be denied diplomatic recognition and, as a last resort, that an international military force be sent to Haiti to supervise truly free elections. **********Nor have these steps drawn significant support from other Caribbean countries, which met this week in Barbados and issued a mildly critical appeal to the Haitian Government. Venezuela, an oil exporter, reportedly opposed any oil embargo against Haiti, citing previous American admonitions after the Arab oil boycott against using petroleum as a political weapon. Idea of Invasion Is Resisted **********Unlike Grenada before the American invasion in 1983, Haiti does not have a Communist Government, so there is no sense of an imminent geopolitical threat and no enthusiasm for military intervention. **********Furthermore, the Reagan Administration does not want to burn all its bridges with Haiti. ''We recognize that no matter what happens in elections, the United States will continue to have an interest there,'' Mr. Holwill said. These include concern about drug trafficking as well as what he called the ''compassionate interest'' in attacking Haiti's deep poverty. **********''Over the long term, the compassionate interest will drive us to maintain food aid,'' he said. ''We will be in a position of working around the Government to feed the people. Haiti doesn't all of a sudden fall off the edge of the earth if they don't hold an election.'' A total of $78.7 million in aid projected for the current fiscal year was suspended in November. This included $30 million for the Haitian treasury, about 80 percent of which was to be used to pay for fuel purchases, $27.9 million for economic projects, $18 million for a program in which the Government sells surplus food in the Haitian marketplace, $1.6 million in food to compensate for reduced American sugar imports and a $1.2 million military aid program aimed mostly at riot-control training, according to the Agency for International Development. **********Left intact are an anti-narcotics program, $22.7 million for private organizations that engage in anti-poverty efforts in Haiti and $7.8 million in food for distribution by those organizations. **********Officials think the major effect of the cutoffs will be on Haiti's balance-of-payments deficit, which is expected to rise from $46 million to more than $100 million, precluding further loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. France, which gave $20.1 million in 1987 and planned $18 million in 1988, has also cut off all aid except funds for humanitarian purposes, American officials said. Canada, which provided about $5 million last year, continues to give humanitarian aid. U.S. Help for Elections **********American political and financial support for the electoral process has been extensive. Before the November elections, the United States contributed $8.1 million toward the $10 million cost of conducting the balloting, according to Dwight A. Ink, assistant administrator in the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean of the Agency for International Development. **********He said that $40,000 was also provided to the National Democratic Institute to send an observer team to monitor the voting. The National Endowment for Democracy, financed with Federal money, gave a $110,000 grant to a Haitian organization to conduct forums on democratic procedures. **********Close Congressional involvement has existed as well. Walter E. Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's Delegate to Congress; Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and others have urged pressure for democracy. **********Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, has even called on some old personal relationships with Haitians, formed when some were colleagues and students when he taught English at Haiti's military academy from 1959 to 1962. General Namphy was an army captain at the time and a fellow instructor. The Foreign Minister, Col. Herard Abraham, was one of Mr. Oberstar's students. Leverage 'Very Limited' **********After the abortive November elections, Mr. Oberstar recalled, Foreign Minister Abraham complained to him that the American sanctions were very harsh. They were meant to be, Mr. Oberstar replied. **********Mr. Oberstar said he hoped the Administration would come out with a strong denunciation of the electoral process now planned. **********But there is no confidence in Washington's ability to influence the situation. ''Our leverage,'' a State Department official said, ''is very, very limited at this point. I don't perceive that we have the possibility before us of changing the rigged elections.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/19/world/police-shoot-tear-gas-at-south-africa-pupils.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Police Shoot Tear Gas At South Africa Pupils", "print_headline": "Police Shoot Tear Gas At South Africa Pupils", "body_text": " **********The police fired volleys of tear gas today at schoolchildren campaigning for clemency for six condemned blacks. **********Witnesses said riot-police officers fired at about 400 students at Mondale High School in Cape Town's mixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain.

Today's American participation in the foreign exchange market was the heaviest in months, and some experts said it indicated that the Reagan Administration wanted a stable dollar, at least for a while. Aggressiveness Cited **********''It looks like the Fed wanted to stop it from going much lower,'' said Allan R. Leslie, vice president of the Discount Corporation of New York, securities dealers. ''We haven't seen them in there that aggressively in some time.'' **********After falling to a post-1940's low of 120.50 Japanese yen in Asian trading, the dollar strengthened later today. In New York trading, the dollar ended at 123 yen, up from the New Year's Eve close of 121.50, and at 1.5880 West German marks, up from Thursday's close of 1.5630 marks.  [ Page D16. ] [ In trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar continued to strengthen, rising to 124.08 yen in the early afternoon. ]  On Wall Street, stocks rose strongly, and some traders largely attributed the rally to the dollar's recovery and computerized program-trading. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 76.42 points, or 3.94 percent, to close at 2,015.25. Even though they were pleased with the rally, investors and traders said they were not inclined to read too much into it.  [ Page D1. ]  Recession Is Feared One concern raised by the dollar's slide is that an increase in interest rates might ultimately be necessary to bolster its value, and that the resulting inflation could slow down the nation's economy and lead to a recession. **********Moreover, while the dollar's decline has helped American goods become more competitive abroad, many economists say another danger is that it could fall to a level that severely hurts the exports of foreign countries, weakening their economies and reducing the demand for American goods that is an objective of Washington. **********More and more, economists and currency experts contend that, for basic economic reasons, if not for today's official dollar buying, the dollar's three-year decline ought at least to stall soon. ''We're getting close to the low point of the dollar,'' said Richard E. Witten, vice president for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company, ''but I would expect it to go a little further.'' **********Still other currency experts caution that the decline could resume if economic circumstances, like a persistently large American trade deficit, warrant it. James Hohorst, a managing director in the foreign exchange department at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said: ''There are a lot of people who like the dollar right now. But if we don't start to see an improvement in the trade deficit, they could get disenchanted very quickly.'' **********By buying and selling currencies, governments are trying to influence the market's outlook on exchange rates. The government buying means that speculators who have been expecting further declines of the dollar might suffer financially. **********Jack A. Kessler, trading manager at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said the intervention ''got some traders to step back and reassess their views.' **********According to traders, the dollar's fall in Tokyo trading yesterday led to an estimated $1 billion in dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan. Moves by Central Banks **********They said the Federal Reserve and the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland and other countries also later moved into the market, and some experts said the Federal Reserve on Sunday night might have bought dollars in Tokyo. To push up the dollar, the central banks bought dollars with other currencies. **********Today in the markets, like much of last week, speculation arose over the intentions of the Group of Seven industrial countries as expressed in a statement on Dec. 23 that ''excessive fluctuation of exchange rates could be counterproductive.'' It said that they desired ''more stable exchange rates'' and that they would ''cooperate closely in exchange markets.'' Reports on Secret Ranges **********Unlike previous agreements, the seven nations - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - said nothing about desiring a certain ''level'' for currencies, their code for setting ranges within which currencies rise and fall before the governments act to stabilize them. But European officials were cited in wire service reports today suggesting that ranges had indeed been set secretly. **********A Treasury Department spokesman, Arthur Siddon, declined to comment on those reports. ''The communique itself calls for close cooperation on exchange rates,'' he added, but he declined to elaborate. **********However, any commitments to a range for the dollar would fly in the face of the Treasury's own disenchantment with an apparent rate-fixing agreement early last year and with views in the marketplace that governments cannot enforce such agreements for long. **********''The statement showed there was no basis for an agreement on anything,'' said Neal M. Soss, an economist at First Boston. ''They made it only to keep people from pestering them about the dollar.'' Floor of 120 Yen Seen **********Ranges for currencies, if there are any, are probably very temporary, other economists said. Stephen H. Axilrod, a former senior official of the Federal Reserve and now vice chairman of the Nikko Securities Company in New York, said today's intervention suggested that the countries have set a floor of 120 yen for the dollar. ''But I doubt that there's a point that says 'This far and no further,' '' he added. **********In the Administration, views of the dollar that have been in conflict for several months seem to be converging toward a desire for stability. The long decline, exceeding 50 percent against some currencies since it began almost three years ago, has succeeded in altering the economics of trade. **********It has laid the groundwork for a decline of the record trade deficits by making American exports cheaper and imports more expensive. The dollar's decline has also partly fulfilled the goal of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d of forcing Japan and West Germany to lower interest rates and to take other measures to spur their own economies and enhance their appetites for imports. **********At the same time, larger reductions in the Federal budget deficit and increases in American interest rates -the two domestic policy changes that economists say should stabilize or strengthen the dollar for more than a few weeks - are unlikely, in part because such actions might slow the economy in a Presidential election year. **********''People want the dollar to stop falling,'' a White House official said of Administration views. ''But no one wants to start a recession to do it.'' The official said the Administration's hopes for the dollar were focused on Jan. 15, when the Government will announce the trade deficit for November. A sharp decline could help the dollar, the officials assume."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/world/moscow-permits-world-court-role.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOSCOW PERMITS WORLD COURT ROLE", "print_headline": "MOSCOW PERMITS WORLD COURT ROLE", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union is prepared to let the World Court arbitrate any disputes over the interpretation of some treaties, a visiting Soviet legal official says. **********The senior Soviet official, who asked not to be named, said the Soviet Union wanted to be on a more equal footing with the United States, which has agreed to let the World Court decide any disputes arising over some 60 treaties and conventions it has signed. Moscow has refused to let the Court settle such quarrels in the past. **********The Soviet official said the process of changing Soviet law to give the World Court binding jurisdiction in those cases had already begun but might be long. He said that ''military considerations'' might also be involved. **********The Soviet disclosure comes a little over a year after Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, called for the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as the World Court is officially called, to play a bigger role in resolving international disputes between nations. Talks on Jurisdiction **********In particular, Mr. Gorbachev suggested the five powers with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council - Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States -should strengthen the Court by accepting its binding jurisdiction in mutually agreed areas of international law. **********The United States and Britain responded by asking Moscow to prove its new support for international law by accepting the clause in many treaties and conventions that gives each side the option of submitting any dispute to the World Court. **********An example of such a treaty, lawyers said, is the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities, which regulates the status of foreign diplomats in the countries where they are accredited. **********The four other permanent Security Council members also agreed to start informal talks with Moscow about its plan for them all to accept binding Court jurisdiction in agreed legal areas. Finance and Trade Disputes **********This fall, the Reagan Administration presented some more specific ideas to the Soviet Union, including the suggestion that the permanent members use the so-called chamber procedure at the World Court, which allows a dispute to be decided by a panel of 5 of the 15 judges chosen by the Court president in consultation with the litigants. **********It also suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union agree to let the World Court decide any future disputes between them relating to the immunity of each Government from judicial action by the other. **********The State Department's chief legal counsel, Abraham D. Sofaer, said this week that the talks among the five permanent Security Council members were ''proceeding constructively.'' But he declined to discuss specifics or to comment on the Soviet Union's apparent readiness to accept World Court arbitration in selected treaty disputes. **********The Soviet official said Moscow thought the five permanent Security Council members might consider agreeing to World Court arbitration in several areas of international law, including disputes about finance and trade and in cases relating to international terrorism and drug trafficking. Views on Sovereign Immunity **********American legal officials said they were having second thoughts about sending disputes over sovereign immunity to the World Court because the American and Soviet starting points in the discussion appeared too far apart. **********The United States traditionally takes a narrow view of sovereign immunity, arguing that only strictly governmental acts - and not those of state-owned trading corporations or other official bodies, for example - should be immune from judicial review. The Soviet Union, however, favors a broader definition. **********The Reagan Administration's interest in discussing a bigger role for the World Court with the Soviet Union and the other permanent Security Council members also represents a shift in American attitudes toward the Court, officials say. **********When the World Court was set up in 1946, the United States accepted its binding jurisdiction in all cases except those falling within the jurisdiction of American courts, as determined by the United States. Another 43 countries also accepted the Court's jurisdiction though usually with important reservations. France, China and the Soviet Union did not. **********But two years ago, the Reagan Administration withdrew the qualified American support for the Court after Nicaragua sucessfully sued the United States for mining its ports and aiding rebels fighting the Government, leaving Britain as the only permanent Security Council member which in principle still accepts the Court's general jurisdiction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/world/violence-worsens-in-south-korean-protests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Violence Worsens in South Korean Protests", "print_headline": "Violence Worsens in South Korean Protests", "body_text": " **********Thousands of South Koreans battled with riot policemen in downtown Seoul today after the authorities blocked a planned march on the home of former President Chun Doo Hwan. **********The violence, two days after large-scale clashes on Thursday, appeared to be the worst here since the popular revolt against President Chun's autocratic rule in June 1987. **********The police fired tear gas to disperse chanting protesters as thousands marched through the main part of the city demanding Mr. Chun's arrest and the overthrow of his successor, President Roh Tae Woo.

But the pressure has risen in recent days. **********According to the chief of South Korea's governing Democratic Justice Party, Mr. Chun has promised to apologize for the excesses of his rule. **********On Thursday, the authorities mobilized more than 20,000 riot police to block a student attempt to raid Mr. Chun's house."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/world/americans-living-in-ex-canal-zone-complain-of-harassment-by-panama.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1988-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Americans Living in Ex-Canal Zone Complain of Harassment by Panama", "print_headline": "Americans Living in Ex-Canal Zone Complain of Harassment by Panama", "body_text": " **********American residents of the former Canal Zone say the Panamanian Government is harassing and intimidating American civilians and military personnel here. **********On at least four occasions this month, American military and civilian personnel have been detained by the Panamanian army or by the police, and in one case two Americans said they were seized and beaten. American residents of the canal area say Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has begun using them as pawns in his battle with the Reagan Administration, and they complain that the United States Government is not doing enough to protect them. **********''In the midst of the present turmoil here, it seems that we have been forgotten and left to deal with life entirely on our own,'' said Loree Olsson, the wife of a canal pilot and the mother of two small children. ''This feeling of widespread desertion is taking its toll on the work force of the Panama Canal and its families.'' Threatened With Death **********In the most recent case of detention and intimidation, two American employees of the Panama Canal Commission were arrested on Wednesday by the Panama Defense Forces. They said they were beaten, threatened with death and held incommunicado for 12 hours. The men were eventually released. They have been charged with endangering the security of the state. **********The arrests and beatings are said to be the first involving American civilians who work for the canal. Before, Panamanian criticism of the United States had been directed at the 10,000 troops of the Southern Command. The Government, which is under the control of General Noriega, had repeatedly guaranteed the safety of canal employees and of other American civilians. **********''We were threatened with being shot, with being sent to Cuba and with being cut up in little pieces and sent to Reagan,'' said Allen Sheppard, a dredging foreman for the canal who was one of those arrested. ''We were handcuffed and repeatedly kicked, shoved, elbowed and walked on.'' **********Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, American employees of the Canal Commission who are arrested by Panamanian authorities are guaranteed the same rights they would have in the United States. But in the latest incident, uniformed and plainclothes Panamanian police are accused of acting outside legal guidelines. Held at Gunpoint **********''They never showed us any I.D., and when we asked them for identification, they poked a .38 in our faces,'' said Karl Marohl, the other detained American. ''That was I.D. enough for me,'' said Mr. Marohl, a crane operator for the canal. **********Mr. Sheppard and Mr. Marohl were arrested while trying to buy food to distribute to hungry families. The money had been raised by employees of the Panama Canal Commission after the banks closed on March 3 and the Government found itself unable to pay its employees. Supermarkets were closed as part of a general strike intended to topple General Noriega. **********Both men said the Panamanian police who beat them and the military intelligence officials who later interrogated them attributed the rough treatment to the state of tension between the United States and Panama. **********''We were told how we are at war, how we were invading their country,'' said Mr. Marohl, 38 years old. ''They kept saying that 'because we are at war, we have to do it this way, and you'd better get that into your heads.' '' Soldiers Are Detained **********Earlier this month, three American soldiers in civilian clothes were detained in the Atlantic port of Colon and accused in Government newspapers of being ''agitators'' who were organizing anti-Noriega mobs. Shortly afterward, four United States military police officers were detained in the capital. They were denied the right to speedily inform United States authorities of their detentions, as required by agreements between the two Governments. **********This week, a United States Army truck whose driver apparently lost his way during a trip across the canal region was stopped by the Panamanian military. The driver and 14 passengers were briefly held, and the Government complained that the incident represented an American violation of the canal treaties. **********The events highlight the delicate situation facing the American community here. More than 50,000 Americans, including soldiers, canal employees and private citizens and their dependents, live in the capital area. **********Of the 7,500 employees of the Panama Canal, 1,134 are American citizens. When dependents are included, the number of Americans who draw their livelihoods in the former Canal Zone is more than 4,000. Most of the soldiers and their families live on military installations like Fort Clayton and Albrook Air Force Station. But the Southern Command says 1,200 military families, about 5,000 people, live in private housing in Panama City. Heightened U.S. Vigilance **********In the last 10 days, the Southern Command has doubled its security detachment to 1,200 military police and soldiers. The force patrols bases and housing areas for United States military personnel and their dependents. **********President Reagan said Thursday that the United States is not contemplating a military invasion to end the political crisis here. But some American residents said they felt like they were being held hostage. **********''We, as foreigners, living under Panamanian jurisdiction, are prime targets in an environment which has begun to turn into chaos,'' said a leaflet distributed Thursday at a meeting of canal workers. ''This chaos surrounds us and will, sooner or later, affect us all.'' **********Since the 1977 treaties, American residents of the Canal Zone have been living under Panamanian sovereignty. In return for a payment from the Canal Commission, the Government supplies services, including police protection. Police Turn Against Americans **********But in the present crisis atmosphere, Panamanian police have not been responding to calls for assistance from some American residents. In other instances, residents said, the police circulated in residential areas, arresting, threatening and insulting Americans. **********Most of the American criticisms are directed at Panamanian authorities. But some zone residents complained about what they see as a business-as-usual attitude on the part of the Department of State and the Canal Commission. **********On March 16, during a failed military effort to oust General Noriega, ''a group of Guardia engineers were dug in behind Curundu Junior High, well within M-16 range of the school,'' said Stephen J. Bellofatto, a traffic scheduler for the canal. ''Yet no one at the commission or in the U. S. military seemed aware or to care that here was a very nervous group of young men who didn't know what side they were on.'' **********A delegation representing the canal workers is scheduled to leave for Washington this weekend. It will meet with members of Congress and with representatives of United States agencies in an effort to make ''our fellow Americans aware of the serious situation we face daily here in Panama,'' Mrs. Olsson said.  Mr. Marohl said of the United States Government: ''They better come down here and do something about protecting me. If not, then shut up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/15/world/ousted-palestinian-american-says-shamir-made-me-a-hero.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1988-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 542, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ousted Palestinian-American Says Shamir 'Made Me a Hero'", "print_headline": "Ousted Palestinian-American Says Shamir 'Made Me a Hero'", "body_text": " **********Mubarak Awad, the Palestinian-American advocate of nonviolent opposition to the Israeli occupation, said yesterday that in deporting him, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ''has made me a hero.'' **********''He has made Palestinian civil disobedience important,'' Mr. Awad said at a news conference at the Manhattan offices of the National Council of Churches, situated in the Interchurch Center, 475 Riverside Drive at 120th Street. **********Commenting on his expulsion after an eight-month battle in the Israeli courts to remain in East Jerusalem, where he was born 44 years ago, Mr. Awad said that the Israelis should have jailed him for his nonviolent activities but that ''they were not willing to challenge civil disobedience in courts.''

For one thing, there is his history. In 1943, when the tide turned against Hitler's armies, and the decision came to raze the Warsaw ghetto, he was the 22-year-old deputy commander of the desperate Jews who challenged German might by taking up arms. **********Unlike most survivors, Dr. Edelman, now a distinguished cardiologist, chose to stay on in Poland. More than that, though, he is a man who says things simply and unmistakably. In a 1976 interview he bristled at the notion that the millions of Jews who did not rebel against the Nazis somehow betrayed their dignity. He thus appeared to dismantle the idea that the resistance fighters had been the real heroes. **********''Those people went quietly and with dignity,'' he said. ''It is a horrendous thing when one is going so quietly to one's death. It is infinitely more difficult than to go out shooting.'' **********Ten years later, in an interview with an underground newspaper, he upset his Polish compatriots by describing the virtual abandonment of the Jewish resistance by Poland's underground Home Army, the major resistance group against the Nazis. An Annoyance to Both Sides **********Dr. Edelman is causing severe discomfort these days. He is at the center of a series of unofficial events to commemorate the ghetto uprising, events that have annoyed both the Polish leadership and Jewish representatives from Israel and elsewhere who have been permitted to flock to Poland to mark the 45th anniversary. **********Over the weekend, the 67-year-old physician mingled with Polish opposition leaders like Adam Michnik, an essayist, and Jan Jozef Lipski, a historian, to dedicate a monument to two Jewish Bund leaders who were executed by Stalin in 1941 for protesting the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland. **********The Government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, loyal to the Soviet ally, was not delighted with the modest red granite stone bearing the names of Henryk Erlich and Wiktor Alter, Jews and fiercely loyal Poles who were executed on trumped-up charges of espionage for Nazi Germany. **********What chiefly irks the Government and the Jewish visitors is that Dr. Edelman's project for alternative events has upset a discreet agreement by the two sides, under which Jewish representatives helped diminish General Jaruzelski's image as international pariah, by meeting with him in New York three years ago, at a time when he was being shunned for his crackdown on Solidarity. In exchange, Poland became the first Soviet bloc country to re-establish limited diplomatic relations with Israel after an 18-year break. Unsettling to Diplomacy **********What also bothers the Jewish representatives from abroad is what they see as the lack of a united front, and a slighting of the ghetto memory by directing attention to two seemingly unrelated figures. But the deeper concern to the Israelis and other Jews appeared to be the unease it caused General Jaruzelski. **********Israeli officials and other Jewish representatives met with General Jaruzelski for nearly two hours today but failed to elicit a commitment for re-establishing full diplomatic relations between Poland and Israel. **********For Dr. Edelman, the criticism from both establishments rang hollow, as he insisted that for each person the ghetto recollection must mean something different. The Right to Personal Memory **********Against General Jaruzelski's Government he fiercely defends the right of independent recollection. **********''This commemoration of the ghetto must not only take place under the banner of the state,'' he said. ''Society has a right to express its honor for the ghetto uprising.'' **********The Polish Government has denounced the independent events as political grandstanding. Israeli and other Jewish representatives, except for a handful of Jewish Bund veterans from the United States and Canada, assiduously avoided them. **********For the Polish Government, the entanglement with Dr. Edelman is nothing new. In 1980, he became active in the Solidarity movement, a role he continues to play. **********Three years later, he called for a boycott of Government-sponsored ceremonies to mark the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising, saying attendance would be ''an act of cynicism and contempt'' in light of the suppression of the Solidarity movement. Medal for Valor Is Spurned **********This year, to lure him into the official ceremonies, the Government offered him Poland's highest decoration for military valor. Dr. Edelman turned it down. **********Those who know the silver-haired physician say that in a sense the love for Solidarity springs from his rediscovery there of the closeness and ideals of the wartime comrades. **********That view appeared to find confirmation in words Dr. Edelman spoke Sunday, when he stood on a mound in front of the low red stone in the sunlit Jewish cemetery. **********''They are dead, but their ideals live on,'' he said, eulogizing the two Bund leaders. ''Organized freedom movements were established in Poland. The Committee for the Defense of Workers, and from its intiative the Solidarity union, with its many millions of members, was born. It is true that over seven years ago it was suppressed, but it continues on in spite of all difficulties, fighting for a free and independent Poland in which all working people will be equal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/19/world/haiti-s-ordeal-the-years-of-strife.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Haiti's Ordeal: The Years Of Strife", "print_headline": "Haiti's Ordeal: The Years Of Strife", "body_text": " **********985  November: Although President Jean-Claude Duvalier had announced a series of political reforms earlier in the year, anti-government rioting breaks out when several teen-agers are killed during a demonstration.

''I don't think they are helping by filling the vacuum,'' a prominent Indian said, choosing his words so as not to offend an American questioner. ''The Peace Corps operates where there is a need,'' said Ambassador Leonard Rochwarger, a retired businessman. ''The Indians left because of the political situation; the Peace Corps comes in to fill a need.'' **********The Ambassador stressed, however, that the need for teachers was such that even if the Indian exodus were not under way, the Peace Corps would be increasing that part of its program. **********Mims J. Austin, the South Pacific island nation's Peace Corps director, said the issue of whether to go on providing help was a continuing subject of discussion among Peace Corps volunteers since General Rabuka overthrew the elected government in May 1987, and instituted openly discriminatory policies against the ethnic Indians, Fiji's largest population group. **********The general is preparing a constitution that will give ethnic Fijians a permanent majority in Parliament, and says that if Indians are unhappy about exclusion from political power, they should leave. He has also said that efforts should be made to convert the Indians, most of whom are Hindu or Moslem, to Christianity. **********The general, a Methodist lay preacher, has imposed upon the largely Hindu or Moslem commercial sector strict observance of the Christian sabbath. Ms. Austin said one volunteer had left to express opposition to the military regime, and the issue had been a factor in some premature departures. **********But both the Ambassador and Ms. Austin assert that to withhold Peace Corps assistance would punish not the Government, but the Fijian people. **********The same American reasoning does not prevail on the matter of foreign aid. Acting under a law that suspends assistance if an unlawful government seizes power in a country, the United States halted its modest aid program. **********The Reagan Administration also held up the dispatch of its new Ambassador after the coup. Mr. Rochwarger did not arrive until March, three months after General Rabuka had nominally restored civilian rule by returning to office Sir Kamisese Mara, the Prime Minister he had deposed. The Government that the general named rules by decree, and he holds the dominant position of Military Commander and Home Affairs Minister. **********Since the return to partial civilian rule, General Rabuka has again embarrassed the United States and other Western countries that had begun to make their peace with the new regime, and installed virtual martial law. **********The United States has not joined India, Australia and New Zealand in publicly condemning the action. But the Ambassador said in an interview, ''America is very concerned by the potential for human rights abuses in the decree and has so stated it to the head of Government.'' **********The most open disapproval of General Rabuka's rule has come from India, instrumental in persuading the Commonwealth to expel Fiji last year and is resisting all efforts to readmit it unless its policies are reversed. Such nations as Malaysia, which also give advantages to indigenous ethnic groups over its Chinese and Indian citizens, favor bringing Fiji back. **********For a country that gladly surrendered itself in 1874 to Queen Victoria, and whose Parliament stands on the corner of Victoria Parade and Gladstone Street, being ousted from the Commonwealth is painful. The word ''loyal'' continues to appear in many official designations in this new republic. **********The country that has rushed in to take advantage of Fiji's loss of friends is France, whose colonial policies and nuclear testing have made it unpopular in the South Pacific.

The results of the inquiry are expected to be published before 1989. **********Until now, the British Government and an international commission of historians established in Austria have failed to find evidence directly linking Mr. Waldheim to war crimes or ordering the deaths of soldiers or civilians. **********In February a commission of historians assigned by the Austrian Government to look into Mr. Waldheim's wartime record reported that he must have been aware of atrocities committed around him and did nothing about them, and that he tried to conceal his military past. But the panel said it had no evidence that Mr. Waldheim himself was guilty of war crimes. To Be Published in Britain **********The newest evidence against Mr. Waldheim was uncovered by Christopher Montague Woodhouse, commander of the Allied mission to the Greek resistance in World War II. Details of Mr. Woodhouse's allegations will appear in the September issue of the British magazine Encounter. **********Mr. Woodhouse, an authority on Greece, has been a diplomat, a Minister of Aviation and a Conservative M.P. He has also written books on Greece and is a professor in the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek at King's College, University of London. **********In addition to the author's personal recollections of the military situation in Greece at the time, Mr. Woodhouse's article cites an interrogation report from the German archives that was first sent to Washington at the end of the war but then returned to the West German Federal Archives in the 1960's. Mr. Woodhouse did not say when he first saw the document. **********The interrogation by Mr. Waldheim ''suffered massive deletions with a brush-tipped pen,'' Mr. Woodhouse said. In the article as well as over the telephone, Mr. Woodhouse said it was unclear why deletions were made. Interrogation Report Cited **********Mr. Woodhouse writes that Mr. Waldheim, as an intelligence officer, signed an interrogation report naming a prisoner, Capt. D. A. La Touche Warren, an Australian-born British Army officer, as a leader of a Sabotagetruppen, or Commando Group. Thus, Mr. Woodhouse writes, Mr. Waldheim knowingly sealed the fate of Captain Warren, executed on May 14 or May 15, 1944. **********Less than two years earlier, Hitler issued a ''commando order'' decreeing that all Allied ''sabotage troops'' captured in German-occupied countries were to be ''completely exterminated.'' **********At the time of his capture, Captain Warren was in charge of an attempt to evacuate a group of escaped prisoners of war, mostly Russian and Polish soldiers, from Greece to Italy. **********The Waldheim commentary said Captain Warren was involved not only in sabotage but also in an Agentennetz, a network of secret agents helping Russian and Polish prisoners escape. **********''All this was pure fantasy,'' Mr. Woodhouse wrote. ''We had no such Agentennetz.

Repeated requests to ignore his presence and continue their work had no effect. **********Mr. Pitroda - who has the rank of a minister of state in the Gandhi Government, the equivalent of deputy secretary in the United States - decided one day that he had had enough. He marched into the typists' room and, when a woman rose, he grabbed her by her shoulders and pushed her down into the chair. ''And don't ever dare to get up again when I come in!'' he thundered at a stunned room. All five typists abruptly sat. ''I never had problems after that,'' he said, laughing, in an interview at his office here. ''The word got around, this guy means business, he actually loses his temper.'' **********Mr. Pitroda, who is 45 years old, was born of poor parents. He worked his way to wealth within a few years of arriving in Chicago in the 1960's with a couple of hundred dollars. He had several companies and a formidable reputation in the American telecommunications industry as an expert in digital switching and dozens of patents to his name. He helped his wife and 36 other relatives go to the United States. **********Last year, Mr. Pitroda startled American Embassy officials here when he announced his plans to renounce his American citizenship, a status coveted across the world as a passport to opportunity. ''I had money, I ran businesses over there, but here I saw I could do something to reshape the country,'' he said. But he says the decision was a painful one. **********He said he wanted to go back to being an Indian national to continue his work as ''a catalyst'' in government management, setting work targets in development areas as diverse as setting up rural telephone exchanges equipped with digital switching equipment, immunizing pregnant women against tetanus and infants against diphtheria, and improving production of oilseeds, an important cash crop. **********Mr. Pitroda and his team at the Center for Development of Telematics are also looking at areas that include protecting the environment and improving the dairying system. **********Although these technology missions formed a part of India's seventh five-year plan, which was started in 1985, it was Mr. Pitroda and a core of technologists, engineers and officials who gave content to the concept. In the inital stages, they ran into stiff opppositon from government agencies that saw a threat to their own powers and faced skepticism from newspaper commentators and economic specialists. **********Mr. Pitroda visited India in 1981, after discussing vague ideas of helping his native land with other India-born Americans in Chicago. It took many meetings and visits before he could convince the Government that he had no ulterior motives in offering his expertise. In 1984, the approval to form the telematics center came through. **********At first, he wanted to confine himself to improving telecommunications but was asked by Mr. Gandhi to broaden his perspectives. And as he began getting more involved, Mr. Pitroda realized that he would have to make a definite commitment to India. **********He returned for good in 1986 with his wife and children and left behind multi-million-dollar businesses in Chicago and Milwaukee, placing them in trusts. **********Mr. Pitroda's critics accuse him of being too ambitious and glib.

Liveried waiters served roast quail on Limoges china and poured Loire Valley wines, properly chilled against the equatorial heat. **********''Bon appetit,'' said the 58-year-old President. 'Versailles in the Jungle' **********More than 20 years after seizing control of his country, Mr. Mobutu has come home. The son of a cook and a hotel maid, Zaire's leader is building an edifice here that some call Versailles in the Jungle. **********Indeed, equipped with luxurious guesthouses and a 100-room motel run by the Mobutu family, Gbadolite is increasingly serving as an international conference center.  [ It may serve as the site of an expected meeting on Saturday between Mr. Mobutu and President P. W. Botha of South Africa. ]  A visit to Mr. Mobutu's ancestral village reveals much about its builder and much about modern Africa. **********Lavishing money on a hometown is not unique to Zaire's President. In Gabon, President Omar Bongo built a $2 billion railroad to his village, Franceville. In the Ivory Coast, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is building an edifice in his tribal capital, Yamoussoukro, that is generally accepted to be the largest church in the world. Daily Airline Service **********The visit to Gbadolite started in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital of three million people. Daily Boeing 737 service now links the capital with Gbadolite, population 37,000. **********After flying 700 miles northeast across a vast nation once called the Belgian Congo, air passengers began to glimpse Mr. Mobutu's extensive family holdings: oil palm, coffee and coconut plantations, orange and grapefruit groves, and beef and dairy cattle ranches. **********The plane touched down on a runway that was lengthened in September to accommodate long-haul jets from Europe. From the shade of a glass and aluminum air terminal, a small fleet of black Mercedes scuttled out to greet party officials and foreign dignitaries who regularly fly here to conduct business. **********Once loaded, the cars passed the construction site of a separate protocol building, already ringed with enough flagpoles to honor the 53 members of the Organization of African Unity, then passed a view of the old Gbadolite -women in front of mud and wattle huts, rhythmically pounding manioc roots in wooden mortars. **********''I think it's fine like that,'' one of the President's economic advisers mused later, echoing Zaire's laissez-faire policy. ''Let them build better houses when they want to. Maybe the palace will inspire them.'' Now It's a City, Officially **********The cars sped down Boulevard Mobutu, a handsome parkway. Quickly it became evident that Gbadolite is no longer the lethargic village of 1,700 souls it was in 1965, the year Mr. Mobutu seized power in a military coup. **********Officially made a city this year, Gbadolite increasingly looks like one. **********Four of Zaire's banks have opened branches here. A satellite-dish communications station provides crisp color television and crackle-free international telephone calls. A German-run hospital provides the best health care between here and the Congo River. And Gbadolite citizens look forward to the inauguration here in November of the first Coca-Cola bottling plant in Equateur Province. **********''Fifteen years ago, people used to hunt monkeys here,'' said Bolo Ngbomga, a cousin of the President who directs a family company responsible for the town's development. **********The man who has made all this possible was delighted. **********''The airport, the farms, the palace - all these are investments in Zaire,'' Mr. Mobutu said one morning as workmen labored in the background, building a new, four-story palace residence. Corruption? He Says Not **********Standing on the marble terrace, shaded from the tropical sun by a fuchsia and avocado colored beach umbrella, the President said he was annoyed by recent declarations by Michel Camdessus, the executive director of the International Monetary Fund. **********Mr. Camdessus, whose job is to police overspending by third-world leaders, declared in mid-September to a West German newspaper that much of the third-world debt problems was due to corruption. **********''There is corruption in those countries,'' Mr. Camdessus declared. ''There are people there whose limitless egoism pushes them to deposit their money overseas, which incurs a terrible flight of capital.'' **********Mr. Camdessus did not mention Mr. Mobutu by name, but the Zairian leader said he had heard the criticism before and he denounced it as ''scandalous.'' **********''I don't subscribe to the opinion that African leaders are irresponsible about the development of their countries, that they waste available capital, that they keep their money in foreign bank accounts,'' Zaire's leader said at the palace. ''Me, for example, I have invested here in Gbadolite.'' Worth Put at $5 Billion **********Over the years, journalists have compiled a list of Mr. Mobutu's overseas real estate holdings: a 16th-century castle in Spain, a 32-room palace in Switzerland, and residences in Paris and on the French Riviera and in Belgium, Italy, the Ivory Coast and Portugal. The State Department has estimated his personal fortune at $5 billion. **********But in an interview last spring with an American Congressman visiting here, Mervyn M. Dymally, Democrat of California, Mr. Mobutu said his European bank accounts held ''less than $50 million.'' **********''Is that such an exorbitant sum for someone who is, for the last 22 years, the head of state of such a great country?'' he asked. **********Critics reply that Zaire has pressing, unattended social needs. About one-third of the children die before the age of 5 in Zaire, which has a per capita income of $180, the eighth lowest in the world. **********The critics say that true development does not mean an occasional water-skier weaving among the dugout canoes on the Ubangi River near here, or a Jesuit priest coming here to teach Zairian children to sing Gregorian chants at the Mobutu family chapel. High-Priced Power on Way **********In his defense, Mr. Mobutu cited the construction of a 27-megawatt dam across the Ubangi, at Mobayi, a spot 10 miles from here. When partly operational next year, the dam will provide power to the town and the palace. **********But in Kinshasa, a European banker grumbled, ''At its maximum capacity, power from Mobayi will be three times more expensive than from any other dam in Africa.'' **********While many European and American diplomats question the success of Mr. Mobutu's economic policies, they generally agree that his blurring of public and private finances has allowed him to co-opt and to control one of Africa's most diverse nations. Zaire, which was torn by civil war before Mr. Mobutu took power, is a nation of 200 ethnic groups. **********The fact that Mr. Mobutu spends up to four months a year in this remote village indicates how well he controls Zaire. **********When asked recently about the suppression of Zaire's only opposition party, the man whose face is stamped on every coin and bill in the land suppressed a small smile. **********''How can you imagine, for a single instant, that a political leader who is so loved by his people, as is my case, that he would oppress the people who adore him, who find in him the expression of discovered peace?'' the President asked as his advisers nodded their heads in absolute agreement. Monotony at the Court **********In a sartorial reflection of Mr. Mobutu's tight political grip, the advisers loyally wore abacost, a closed-necked tunic styled by the President in the late 1970's to replace Western suits. As they stood under the equatorial sun, beads of perspiration formed at their temples and slowly rolled down their cheeks. **********With this vast nation firmly under control, Mr. Mobutu seems restless. **********Court life can be monotonous. Two recent evenings produced a similar dinner guest list - family relatives from the President's Ngbandi tribe who were bused in from nearby villages; an Indian-born therapist from Stamford, Conn., who was helping the President lose weight through yoga and a vegetarian diet, and an elegantly attired Senegalese adviser who, between bites of pate and chilled salmon, spoke nostalgically of friendships with black power militants at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1966. **********A powerful, gravel-voiced man, Zaire's President often seems eager to pace a larger stage. In recent weeks, he jetted in and out of the new airport here, seeking to broker a peace agreement between two warring factions fighting a civil war in neighboring Angola. **********A few years ago, he startled the Organization of African Unity by proposing a new organization that would exclude Africa's Arab countries - the League of Black African States. The idea never went anywhere. Other African leaders saw it as an ill-disguised bid for leadership of the continent. **********Mr. Mobutu's preoccupation with grandeur was perhaps subconsciously revealed in the official transcript of this correspondent's French-language interview.

Zimmer power plant here will probably be the world's only coal-fired plant with a control room designed to survive a nuclear meltdown. **********Zimmer began as a plant at the forefront of nuclear technology. But when construction costs kept mounting, its owners decided to abandon those frontiers and go back to what they knew - coal. **********''We know coal inside and out,'' said Allen M. Hill, a vice president of DPL Inc., whose subsidiary, Dayton Power and Light, owns the plant along with Cincinnati Gas and Electric and American Electric Power. **********The companies had already pumped $1.7 billion into Zimmer as a nuclear plant when they discovered that another $1.7 billion would be needed before it generated its first kilowatt of electricity. So for about the same money it would have taken to finish the reactor, they are grafting on a coal boiler of much larger capacity. Company officials said the project was under budget and ahead of schedule. **********''It's nice after years of nuclear announcements, which are always higher and longer,'' said Peter H. Forster, president and chief executive officer of DPL, referring to the construction delays and cost overruns that have become typical of nuclear plant projects. **********Zimmer is not alone in nuclear plant conversion. Another failed nuclear project, Midland in Michigan, is being converted to gas. Both plants could point the way to conversion of a Zimmer twin, another 800-megawatt General Electric nuclear reactor. That plant is Shoreham on Long Island. After $5.3 billion and 21 years, its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, has agreed to sell it to the State of New York for $1, for scrap. **********But utility executives on Long Island and here at Zimmer, on the Ohio River 30 miles east of Cincinnati, point to some differences that indicate that coal or gas may not be appropriate on Long Island. The experience in Michigan and Ohio suggests that engineering plays a role in choosing between gas or coal conversion and abandonment. So do politics and regulatory policy. **********Engineering is not an obstacle here, where the post-nuclear era is taking shape rapidly with few if any problems. Sometimes, though, the plant can be a bit jarring to the eye. **********Behind the latticework of girders that will support a 1,300-megawatt coal boiler is the steel-reinforced containment building that houses the reactor that will never be used. And turning the corner inside a re-used turbine hall, the visitor comes to doors marked ''radwaste,'' for radioactive waste. The reactor is sealed, but the radwaste system will be useful for non-radioactive water. **********After completion, the plant will function far more reliably than the typical reactor, because its major components, including an advanced antipollution system, are modeled on five operating coal plants of similar capacity, according to John R. Jones, the project manager for American Electric Power, which is managing the conversion. ''Nothing here is unproven,'' he said. **********Efficient coal boilers make steam hotter and under more pressure than reactors do. But the builders here concluded that if they ran that steam through a standard coal turbine, the second-hand steam emerging at the other end would be very similar to what comes out of a reactor. That allowed them to re-use two of the reactor's three turbines, plus its cooling tower, steam condensing system, electric substation and transmission links. **********More important, perhaps, it also saved the trouble of finding a new site and getting the numerous permits from regulatory bodies. **********That does not mean the decision to abandon Zimmer as a nuclear plant was easy. **********''We took a huge hit,'' Mr. Forster said, referring to the financial drain. ''It had to be the most difficult decision our company ever faced. These things drain the energy of a company, too. The fact that you're really turning your back on all that work and all that energy is an emotional thing. You really don't want to do it.'' The decision also included suing the reactor's manufacturer, General Electric, over design problems. **********There were some technical challenges in the conversion, too. The site here is a scant 300 acres, about the amount that forms the ''lay down'' area for storing parts at a standard coal plant construction site. So American Electric had major components built elsewhere and shipped in by barge in modules, at a cost saving. The procedure also saved time, which is money, because interest costs are accumulating on the earlier investment at about $1 million a day. **********The Zimmer conversion has also benefited from political support. The new coal plant will create a demand for 3.5 million tons of coal a year, which is welcome in Ohio. The state's depressed coal industry produced only 31 million tons last year. **********The conversion was also helped economically by another non-engineering factor: Ohio law prohibited the companies from recovering any of their investment from rate payers unless the plant was ''used and useful.'' Adding a coal boiler allowed the companies to say that about half the expenditures on the reactor were useful for the coal plant. **********Meanwhile, Midland's conversion to gas is under way. The original builder, the Consumers Power Company, contributed the site and equipment in exchange for a 49 percent stake in a new consortium. Consumers Power spent $4.1 billion to bring two reactors at Midland to what it said was 85 percent of completion, but was forced to walk away in the summer of 1984 because of skyrocketing costs and construction difficulties. **********About $600 million in new money will turn one of the reactors into a 1,380-megawatt gas-fired generator, which will also supply steam to a nearby Dow Chemical plant. **********Paul Knopick, a spokesman for Consumers Power, said conversion should be ''dynamite for the people at Shoreham.'' It is far faster than starting from scratch, he said. If gas is chosen instead of coal, ''we don't have any environmentalists jumping up and down, worrying about acid rain.'' **********At Lilco, Russell C. Youngdahl, the president, said there were no technical barriers to conversion of the reactor, but added, ''The economics of it are clearly poor.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/09/world/shevardnadze-to-meet-with-shultz-in-2-weeks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shevardnadze to Meet With Shultz in 2 Weeks", "print_headline": "Shevardnadze to Meet With Shultz in 2 Weeks", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State George P.

The primary sources for the beans are Canada and Belgium. The new trade restraints would also apply to Nicaraguan shrimp, another product that is processed and packaged in third countries. **********Americans that import the coffee, mostly small businesses and food cooperatives, said the Administration had previously listed the shrimp and coffee as the products of the third countries.

Students at Hazelwood, a secondary school in north Belfast, have been frequently taunted and stoned by children from primary schools. After the windows of the school's bus were smashed by bricks, another route had to be found. **********The decision by some teachers to work at the school, in an area noted for factional violence and murders, has caused bitter divisions within their families. **********The hard-core hostility stems from the fact that Hazelwood is an integrated school, which in the vocabulary of Northern Ireland means that both Roman Catholic and Protestant children are taught together. 'Branded as Troublemaker' **********''When you speak out here you become branded as a troublemaker or traitor,'' Mr. Rowley said in his office. ''That is what we are in educational terms. But when you divide people, you are telling them unconsciously that there is something threatening or odd or funny about the other group. In America in the 1960's, if you went to an all-white shool you didn't have to be told that blacks were strange. Everything, even the wallpaper, told you that.'' **********The student body is made up largely of children from groups viewed here as most prone to sectarian prejudice. At least half of them are from working-class families and 30 percent have parents who are unemployed or on welfare. **********The school is still a glaring rarity in a place where communities boldly proclaim which side of the divide they are on with vivid protest murals on crumbling walls, political slogans on lampposts and, too, with the barrel of a gun. Of the nearly 350,000 students in Northern Ireland, just over 1,000 attend seven integrated schools, all of which have opened since 1980. **********Any school that receives public funds is required by law to accept children of any religious denomination. But the reality, education officials say, is that there is little mixing. 'A Big Challenge' **********''The bedrock of division, segregation and bitterness is the working-class communities,'' said Tom McKee, the Northern Ireland official of a national teachers' union that favors integration. ''Hazelwood is deliberately trying to recruit children from working-class backgrounds. That's a big challenge. ''They are coming face to face with sectarianism. If you bring Catholic and Protestant children together and they work and play together, do you draw the line there? What happens if a Catholic boy meets a Protestant girl and they want to get married? How are they going to be greeted by their community? It would be a real crisis. You can never underestimate the difficulties.'' **********In an effort to change this situation gradually, the authorities have shifted from a policy of what one Government official characterized as ''passive benevolence'' toward integrated education to one of active encouragement. For the first time, the Government has proposed laws that would require it to foster integration. **********In a package of education legislation announced two months ago, the authorities laid out plans to provide financing to develop new integrated schools and to allow existing segregated schools to change into institutions for children of both traditions. Commitment to Integration **********But the authorities plan to facilitate integrated education only where parents express a desire for it. The measures do not require that schools have a specific percentage of Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils before they can receive funds but instead that they demonstrate a commitment to and progress toward integration. **********''The Government is taking a much more active role,'' a Government spokesman said. ''But the fundamental principle is that it's education in accordance with parents' wishes. We can't impose integrated education.'' **********The Government's move has been met with criticism, including some from Catholic and Protestant religious leaders who have portrayed the measures as a direct threat to the authority of their churches. In addition, some Catholics express fear that the commitment to integrated schools could cause their their church-managed schools to be neglected in the allocation of scarce public funds. **********''I would eventually like to see integrated schools,'' said Danny Morrison, an official of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. ''But the fact is that the British Government's reasons are not altruistic and the basic idea is to produce people who support the union, to produce little unionists. Had we not gone to Catholic schools when we were younger, we would have received no education in the history of our country. This is not about bridging the sectarian divide.'' Called Courageous Leap **********But others call the changes a courageous leap forward. At Hazelwood, where the student body has grown from 17, when the school was founded three years ago to 210 today, the mix is about 55 percent Catholic and 45 percent Protestant. There is a waiting list of 150. The school had to struggle to raise about $1 million over the three years before the Government accredited it several months ago and began public financing under a formula of 85 percent aid. But the school estimates that it will still have to raise about $170,000 a year to cover its 15 percent share, while trying to pay off $180,000 in debts. **********Mr. Rowley says that simply putting children together is not the answer because they must go back to the jagged-edged streets and unrelenting peer pressure of their ghettoes. What Hazelwood tries to do is establish a mini-society of sorts that promotes values and attitudes at odds with what the students experience in their communities. **********''My generation has been ruined as far as mutual understanding,'' Mr. Rowley said. ''There has been so much hostility and hatred. We are trying to take the blinders off the children. Then we can expose them to alternative viewpoints and encourage them to ask 'Why must I?'"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/nkomo-sees-beginning-of-zimbabwean-unity.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1988-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nkomo Sees Beginning of Zimbabwean Unity", "print_headline": "Nkomo Sees Beginning of Zimbabwean Unity", "body_text": " **********Joshua Nkomo, the patriarch of Zimbabwean black nationalism, stood before an attentive crowd at a political rally and said he had a story to tell. **********''It is a long story, which we have just completed,'' Mr. Nkomo, his huge frame full of animation, told about 5,000 people seated in the dust of this ramshackle town in Mr. Nkomo's southwestern political base of Matabeleland. **********The white-haired politician, 70 years old, was referring to two years of difficult negotiations between his opposition group and the nation's ruling party that led last December to an agreement to unite the two parties. In a larger sense, the story involves the chaotic fortunes of a man who once sought to become Zimbabwe's unchallenged leader but now seeks only lasting peace and a measure of political participation in the land where he fought white rule for three decades. 'Just One of the Leaders' **********''I am just one of the leaders of the country,'' Mr. Nkomo said softly in an interview after the rally earlier this month. His ever-present carved walking stick, a symbol of chieftainship, rested against a table at a Roman Catholic mission where he and his followers had gone for a meal and relaxation. **********''I've been one for quite a long time and what has kept me going all the time is the bickering that has been going on.

I am now in the beginning of completion.'' **********Mr. Nkomo initiated the negotiations with President Robert Mugabe, his long-standing political rival. The resulting agreement is viewed as a step toward healing deep, historically rooted divisions between the country's Ndebele-speaking minority, who make up Mr. Nkomo's constituency, and the majority Shona-speaking followers of Mr. Mugabe. Last Hope for Political Survival **********The pact, too, represents Mr. Nkomo's last hope for the political survival of his followers, members of the Patriotic Front-Zimbabwe African People's Union. The party had fallen increasingly into disarray under the pressure of repeated crackdowns by the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front against what the government insisted were armed dissidents loyal to Mr. Nkomo. **********In the end, the terms of the agreement were largely dictated by Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Nkomo settled for the position of a senior minister in the president's inner circle and, in the view of some of his supporters, allowed his party to be swallowed by the ruling group. **********''We are comrades,'' Mr. Nkomo said of Mr. Mugabe, who entered politics as the former opposition leader's junior aide. Clashes With Mugabe **********''We were comrades at arms when we fought for independence. We are now coming together as comrades at arms, not sharp arms but arms to build a strong and hard-working nation.'' **********But history provides a different version of the relationship between the two politically ambitious men. **********More than 30 years ago, Mr. Nkomo was the pre-eminent nationalist leader in then white-ruled Rhodesia and represented both the Shona and Ndebele ethnic groups. **********But in 1963, Shona politicians, including Mr. Mugabe, broke with Mr. Nkomo to found the party that was to lead the country to independence as Zimbabwe 17 years later. **********In the seven-year war for majority rule, Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo maintained a loose alliance called the Patriotic Front. But they kept their guerrilla armies separate, and personal animosity between the two men, each of whom spent a decade in detention, was just below the boiling point. Fled Country in '83 **********The alliance fell apart when a British-sponsored peace was proclaimed in 1980. Elections, which both men contested individually, were held and Mr. Mugabe emerged the winner. Mr. Nkomo reportedly wept. **********Mr. Nkomo entered a fragile government coalition as a member of Mr. Mugabe's Cabinet. But he was dismissed in 1982 for purportedly plotting a coup, a charge that he denies. In 1983, when government troops were accused of having massacred civilians in Matabeleland, Mr. Nkomo fled to Botswana and then to London. He returned to Zimbabwe in August of that year. **********In years past, Mr. Nkomo complained that his supporters were harassed and detained and his home raided. In an interview in 1986, he said that Mr. Mugabe ''seems to be hostile toward me'' and that he had ''suffered much more in the last four years than in the 30 years of my struggle for independence.'' Said to Plan Retirement **********Close associates say that Mr. Nkomo plans to retire in a few years, after what he hopes will be the consolidation of true unity in this southern African nation. For now, he is delivering fiery speeches at rallies in this region of flat, sun-charred savannah, and elsewhere, to canvass support for the party merger in Mr. Mugabe's drive toward a socialist, one-party state. **********The leader commands enormous respect from many Zimbabweans, receiving more applause than the President at some public events. But those in a more radical camp still consider him a sellout because of his negotiations with the former white-minority Government of Ian D. Smith during the liberation campaign. **********''I've had bumps here and there,'' Mr. Nkomo, the son of one of his country's first black missionary teachers, said of his political life. **********''If I was one who did not understand what the world really is, maybe I would feel bitterness.

Only the steady up-and-down cadence of his knees betrays whatever tension he feels as the court hears details of how at least 12 Californians, perhaps many more, died in an orgy of kidnapping, sexual abuse and murder. **********Although the 27-year-old former United States marine has his wrists and ankles manacled, the eyes of two Mounties beside the dock rarely leave him. The last time someone from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ''Ten Most Wanted'' list faced an extradition hearing in Canada, he escaped and remained free for two years. This time, the Canadians have said that Mr. Ng is being kept in the tightest security their prison system allows. **********If he does not seem particularly anxious, it may be because the Hong Kong-born Mr. Ng, whose name is pronounced ING, has the prospect of remaining in Canada for several years while extradition proceedings continue. And in theory, at least, even if his extradition is ordered by the courts, the Canadian Government could invoke a section of a 12-year-old extradition treaty to block his return to California unless the state guarantees that he will not be executed. **********Canada has never exercised that section of the treaty. But the case of Mr. Ng, who fled to Canada in June 1985 after the police said they had discovered a torture chamber on a property in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, illustrates the plight that has arisen for Canada as a result of the growing use of the death penalty in the United States. While Canada carried out its last executions in 1962 and formally abolished the death penalty in 1976, there are 37 American states with death penalty statutes, and about 2,150 people are on death row in American prisons. Grisly Case Outlined **********In the grisly case being outlined here against Mr. Ng, the heavily muscled former marine has been depicted as the partner in a two-man ''brotherhood'' that abducted men and women from the San Francisco area to a remote property outside the mountain town of Wilseyville, 120 miles away. Among the victims were two small children. Videotapes said to have been made by the killers reportedly show two women being tortured and sexually abused in a concrete bunker constructed for the purpose. **********Leonard Lake, the former marine who the police say was Mr. Ng's partner, committed suicide after his arrest. But Mr. Ng fled to Calgary, where he was arrested within a month during an armed robbery, for which he is currently serving a four-and-a-half-year Canadian prison term. **********Gov. George Deukmejian of California has written to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that allowing Mr. Ng to stay here ''could have the unfortunate consequence of making Canada a haven for death-penalty fugitives.'' **********And among relatives of the California victims, bitterness runs high. ''It's fine for your country to have no death penalty if that's what you want,'' said Sharon Sellito, mother of Paul Cosner, a 39-year-old car salesman whom Mr. Ng is accused of murdering. ''But why are you making it applicable across the border?'' **********A conflicting stand has been taken by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Ng case and the cases of Joseph Kindler and Roger Judge, whose extradition is being sought in connection with capital murder cases in Pennsylvania. Henry Schwarzschild, director of the A.C.L.U.'s capital punishment project at the organization's New York office, said in a telephone interview that Canada should demand that no death penalty be carried out in the Ng, Kindler and Judge cases as a condition for returning the fugitives. Another American Extradited **********While the men deserved to stand trial, Canada should not ''play Pontius Pilate,'' he said. ''The treaty enables the Canadian Government not to deliver these people to the hangman.'' **********The record suggests that if the courts order Mr. Ng's extradition, the Government might approve it without demanding that his life be spared. Although the treaty containing the death-penalty provision went into effect in 1976, it was not until 1985 that the first case came up for a government decision. The case involved Mr. Kindler, one of the two Philadelphia men, who was convicted in 1984 of the first-degree murder of a robbery accomplice who had been beaten to death with a baseball bat and dumped into the Delaware River. **********In approving Mr. Kindler's extradition in January 1986, John Crosbie, Justice Minister at the time, said the Government wanted ''to discourage those who commit murder in a foreign state and seek haven in Canada hoping to avoid the death penalty.'' Moves to return the American were frustrated when he escaped in October 1986, but after he was rearrested in New Brunswick last month a new court ruling staying the minister's order was issued. The judge said that returning the American to face a possible death sentence could be a denial of his rights to ''life, security and liberty'' under Canadian law. **********A similar challenge on Mr. Ng's behalf seems certain. Donald W. MacLeod, the Calgary lawyer representing the former marine, said in an interview that California should follow Washington State's example in the case of another of Mr. MacLeod's clients, Tony Ng. Tony Ng, no relation of Charles Ng, was wanted in the 1983 slaying of 13 people in a Chinese gambling club in Seattle. Efforts to halt his return to the United States were relinquished in 1985 when Washington dropped plans to seek the death penalty. Mr. Ng later received seven consecutive life terms for his role in the affair. Lawyer Rejects Argument **********Mr. MacLeod rejected the argument that American fugitives here had no right to hide behind Canada's abolition of the death penalty. ''There are a great many people opposed to the death penalty in the very state that seeks to prosecute Charles Ng to death,'' he said. **********He implied that Governor Deukmejian and prosecutors in Calaveras County, Calif., where 11 of the 12 murders occurred, were being stubborn. ''What prosecutor in his right mind is going to say, 'Because I can't kill him, I don't want him back'?'' he said. **********John Martin, the District Attorney for Calaveras County, said in a telephone interview that agreeing to drop the death penalty in the Ng case had never been considered. He said the case had been compared for its brutality to the Charles Manson case. **********''The only way that justice can be served in this case, for the sake of the victims and in the interests of the people of California, would be for Charles Ng to face trial in California with the possibility of the death penalty,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/13/business/robins-gets-new-offer-from-american-home.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1988-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 780, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Robins Gets New Offer From American Home", "print_headline": "Robins Gets New Offer From American Home", "body_text": " **********With the support of a committee representing shareholders in the A. H. Robins Company's bankruptcy proceedings, the American Home Products Corporation yesterday sweetened its takeover bid for the Richmond-based drug company. **********The new offer, like all the others in the month-old bidding war involving American Home, Rorer Group Inc. and Sanofi of France, was criticized as overly generous to shareholders by the lawyers representing tens of thousands of women who say they were injured by Robins's Dalkon Shield birth-control device. **********But analysts said the new offer was likely to derail Robins's plan to sell a 58 percent stake in the company to Sanofi, unless the French drug maker improves its offer. Robins is scheduled to seek the permission to sign its Sanofi agreement on Jan. 21 from United States District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. Under American Home's new offer, Robins's shareholders would get $700 million in American Home stock, up from $600 million. As an alternative to its earlier proposal to provide $2.48 billion over six years to the trust fund being set up to compensate Dalkon Shield claimants, American Home offered the possibility of paying $2.15 billion in cash to the trust as soon as the takeover is completed. **********The Dalkon Shield claimants have said that Judge Merhige's estimate that the total injury claims are worth $2.48 billion means that such a sum must be paid into the trust as soon as Robins's bankruptcy plan is approved. In addition, they argue, the claims should be paid before shareholders receive anything. Robins's Stock Rises to $23.50 **********''This offer, like all the others, stands the bankruptcy code on its head by paying shareholders before creditors,'' said Murray Drabkin, the lead attorney for the claimants in the bankruptcy proceedings, referring to the six-year payment plan. **********The new American Home offer amounted to about $29 a share for Robins's stock, about $1.50 a share more than the current Rorer offer. Rorer has proposed swapping each Robins share for 0.685 share in the Fort Washington, Pa., drug company, which finished trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $40.25, down 87.5 cents. **********American Home ended trading on the Big Board at $74 a share yester-day, down $1. Robins's shares ended at $23.50, up 50 cents. **********Analysts said that the Sanofi offer was worth $15 to $20 a share to Robins's shareholders, depending on estimates of the likely trading price of the company that would be created by merging Robins with CEVA Laboratories Inc., the Sanofi animal health products subsidiary. **********The analysts said that the current value of the funds that Sanofi has proposed putting into the compensation trust over five years was about $1.9 billion, or $250 million less than American Home's new offer. **********''That fact that American Home has sweetened the equation for both the shareholders and the Dalkon Shield claimants shows how serious they are,'' said Viren Mehta, who has been following the battle over Robins for S. G. Warburg & Company. Sanofi Still Interested **********Robins declined to comment on the new offer yesterday, but a spokesman for Sanofi, France's second-largest pharmaceutical company, indicated that the company believed the battle was far from over. **********''As Mr. Dehecq said last week, Sanofi is here to fight and win,'' said David L. Duffy, referring to Thursday's appearance before analysts in New York by Jean-Francois Dehecq, Sanofi's chief operating officer, and E. Claiborne Robins Jr., Robins's president and chief executive. **********Sanofi has placed a much higher value on its bid than the Robins shareholders, arguing that its deal was worth $25 a share now and would be worth more than $30 a share in several years. **********American Home became the first of the rivals to win the Equity Committee's support in part because it designed a way to protect the value it has promised to the shareholders. The new offer proposes to swap anywhere from 0.351 American Home share to 0.429 American Home share for each Robins share, depending upon whatever ratio makes for a total deal worth $700 million at the time the merger takes place. **********''We view this as a collar that protects us against a 10 percent move in share prices either way,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director at Rothschild Inc. and financial adviser to the Equity Committee.

Both sides simply discussed their positions, and negotations are expected to continue for days or perhaps weeks. **********After the hourlong discussion between senior officials from both parties, Mr. Peres, the leader of the Labor Party, said: ''We heard an invitation. Some things were explicit, and some things were open. Now we are going to discuss it among ourselves.'' #21 Days to Reach Pact On Monday, President Chaim Herzog officially invited Mr. Shamir to form a new government after 63 members of the newly elected Parliament - none of them from Labor - told him that they preferred Likud over Labor. **********Mr. Shamir now has 21 days to reach formal agreements with those members of Parliament, including 18 from religious parties that have extracted a broad array of promises from Likud, which with its allied right-wing parties won 47 seats in the national elections Nov. 1. Sixty-one seats form a majority in the 120-member Parliament. **********Tens of thousands of Israelis have been protesting the inclusion of the religious parties in Israel's next government. That is one reason Mr. Shamir is negotiating with Labor, even though it is probable that he could form a goverment that excluded Labor if he chose. **********But even if Labor decided to accept Mr. Shamir's offer, the Prime Minister said this evening, he is not planning to drop the religious parties, even though three of them are flexible on the issue that seems to be of the most importance to Likud: holding onto the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Domestic Issues Favored **********To the religious parties, domestic issues are of far greater importance, so they have not raised the issue of the occupied territories. **********''I explained to Labor that it's my opinion that the good of the people demands a wide goverment with Likud and Labor and the other parties that said they wanted to participate in a government led by me,'' Mr. Shamir said this evening. **********Labor probably would have little trouble accepting that. By all accounts, Labor made even more extravagant promises to the religious parties while still involved in negotiations. **********Earlier today, Mr. Shamir said he has no plans to back away from the pledges Likud made to the religious parties. He has promised them control of four Cabinet ministries and subordinate positions in several others. Two Controversial Laws **********He has also told them he would insure enactment of two laws that have aroused controversy. One would close restaurants and businesses on the Jewish Sabbath, sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. The other would change the definition of who is Jewish. If that law passed, only people with Jewish mothers or others who converted to Judaism under the supervision of an Orthodox rabbi, not a Reform or Conservative one, would qualify for automatic Israeli citizenship. **********But when he accepted Mr. Herzog's invitation on Monday to form a new government, Mr. Shamir said, ''I am aware of the voices of concern and apprehension reaching us from diaspora Jewry, especially U.S. Jewry.'' **********Later, his office issued a statement intended to placate American Jews.

Jankowski, president of the Broadcast Group, are realized it will help bring a younger audience to the network that attracts the oldest. **********The advertising is the work of Backer Spielvogel Bates, which was assigned what was described as a $50 million account last summer. It will be running on the CBS network (no other network or station would take it for competitive reasons) as well as in print and on radio. **********The theme is, ''CBS. Television you can feel.'' **********And that, according to Mr. Jankowski, comes out of consumer research that shows that viewers who watch the tube are looking for ''involvement.'' It is also a line that the agency has adapted to all the programs it wishes to advertise, the theory being that the younger, sought-after audience can be attracted by promoting certain well-reviewed new 1987-88 programs. **********''The emphasis,'' Mr. Jankowski said, ''is on quality and risk taking.'' **********Each of the 20-second TV spots -and the print advertising is a perfect lift from the TV - focuses on a different show. **********For ''Tour of Duty,'' the series about Vietnam infantry combat, the line comes out, ''So powerful you can feel it.'' For ''Frank's Place'' it is, ''So spicy you can feel it.'' **********The word inserted for ''Beauty and the Beast'' is ''romantic''; for ''Wiseguy,'' ''intense''; for ''High Mountain Rangers,'' ''gutsy.'' **********For an upcoming miniseries, ''Windmills of the Gods,'' the line becomes, ''So gripping you can feel it.'' **********And it will be adapted to news and sports programs as well, not only for the network, as pointed out by Warren Spellman, vice president advertising and promotion of the Broadcast Group, but also on local stations, both owned and affiliated. Their managements saw the ad program during a recent three-day conference on Maui, Hawaii, and, Mr. Jankowski and Mr. Spellman both attest, greeted the effort with a standing ovation. (Ever hear that before?) You'll notice that when Mr. Spellman talked about the possibilities of the theme line, he included all of the divisions of the Broadcast Group. That's something new, because when the account went to B.S.B., it represented a consolidation of the advertising needs of the Broadcast Group for the first time. Previously, each of those divisions within the group did its own advertising and often had its own agency. **********One of the reasons for the consolidation is that these days, when Mr. Jankowski looks at the competitive scene, he no longer sees only NBC and ABC, which flank him on the popularity chart, but also all of the other video, including both cable and videocassette recorders, that contributes to the erosion of his audiences. **********He is looking for strength through unity. And he said he feels he can get people to remember CBS by changing the way it advertises. He figures he has gotten advertising that stands out, and now he expects to use the media differently. **********In the past, 80 percent of the print budget went into TV Guide. That is being cut back, but by how much Mr. Spellman declined to say. As a matter of fact, when it came time for him to get specific about budget or media use, the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn alumnus developed a slight case of lockjaw. He said it was brought on by the competitive climate. **********Mr. Spellman did manage to squeeze from between clenched teeth the information that ads would run in national newsweeklies and in newspapers in the top 10 markets, but never all at the same time. **********As to the budget, well, when B.S.B. got the account it was estimated in the press at being a $50 million piece of business. **********Since there will be more advertising this year outside the CBS network, there will be a considerable increase in the actual cash outlay. That, said Mr. Jankowski and Mr. Spellman, will be offset by the savings from the consolidation of all the different advertising departments within the group, as well as the agencies that serve them. **********''Economies of scale,'' said Mr. Spellman when he recovered from his attack."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/13/world/luanda-journal-a-troop-paper-for-all-their-men-from-havana.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1988-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 993, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Luanda Journal; A Troop Paper for All Their Men From Havana", "print_headline": "Luanda Journal; A Troop Paper for All Their Men From Havana", "body_text": " **********The newspaper's weekly language lesson teaches Cuban soldiers how to say '''brother'' in the language of the Kuanhama tribe of southern Angola. **********This summer, the paper printed exclusive photographs of MIG-23 jet fighters coming in to Cahama airstrip, a landing field hurried to completion to bring Cuban air power within five minutes' range of South African positions in Namibia, the territory formally known as South-West Africa. **********In a war fought in a remote, almost empty countryside, Angolan officials generally succeed in camouflaging the extent of Cuba's participation.

Judging from the pages of Verde Olivo, such a withdrawal may be difficult to accomplish. **********In addition to building airstrips, the Cubans repair tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers; provide medical care; maintain radio and field phones, man radar and antiaircraft batteries, and provide officers and advisers for many Angolan Army units. Helpless Without Cubans **********''The Angolans will be absolutely helpless without the Cubans,'' a European diplomat here said. ''The Cubans maintain the equipment and supply transport.'' **********Furthermore, according to Verde Olivo, Cuban troops have taken part in heavy fighting along what the newspaper called ''the southern front.'' This information was offered by a Cuban soldier, Antonio Vega Ramos, who recently told a Verde Olivo interviewer about his experience under attack in an armored personnel carrier at Cuito Cuanavale, in southeastern Angola: **********''One missile set the gasoline tanks on fire; another was a direct hit in the engine and wounded the mechanic; the third wounded the driver. **********''We abandoned the vehicle by the back exits under heavy enemy fire,'' the soldier said. His unit was fighting the combined forces of South African soldiers and Angolan guerrillas, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. **********As in virtually all Verde Olivo stories, this account ended in victory for the ''combined Angolan-Cuban forces.'' No casualty figures were given. More War Stories **********In other editions, there were long articles on two other battles with heavy Cuban participation: the destruction of a South African armored column in Tchipa on June 27 and the bombing of Calueque Dam the same day. **********In the Tchipa battle, Lieut. Avilio Osvaldo Perez told a Verde Olivo interviewer, the Cubans carried the day in part because ''the South African armored cars are very tall, and by getting close, we were under their angle of fire.'' **********The attack by Cuban and Angolan MIG pilots on the Calueque hydroelectric complex took the lives of at least six white South African soldiers and, according to some opinion, helped induce the South Africans to withdraw from southern Angola. A Verde Olivo photo essay on the attack included a picture of a Cuban guard at the dam holding aloft a shoulder-level antiaircraft missile. **********''Apartheid boots will never again step here,'' the caption read. Out With the Troops **********Increasingly, Verde Olivo reporters accompany Cuban units on missions. **********Luis Pardo Dieguez wrote recently of his trip with a supply convoy heading to the front lines. **********''On the first day, as we passed a hut, a little girl shouted happily, ''Cubans, Guajira, Guantanamera!'' he wrote. ''Is there any corner of this country where they don't know us, I wondered.'' **********Similar to other armies fighting oversea wars, Cuban soldiers are regularly entertained by musical troupes from home. **********Two groups toured Cuban front lines in Angola this summer - a team of singers, dancers, guitarists and circus acrobats from the National Art School and an ''artists' '' brigade from the Cuban Interior Ministry.

Political Lessons, as Well **********For the political education of the troops, Verde Olivo carries a weekly front-page editorial on southern African affairs. A recent headline about Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebels' leader, caught the drift of such pieces: ''Savimbi's visit to the West was a total failure.'' **********In addition to emphasizing the military links between Cuba and Angola, the publication also points out the close political relationship. **********A series of ceremonies in Angola marked the 35th anniverary of the July 26, 1953 attack on Moncada Barracks by a young Fidel Castro - a landmark event that Mr. Castro's Government sees as the opening shot in the eventually successful revolution against the forces of President Fulgencio Batista. **********At Jose Marti Park in Luanda, Angolans and Cubans planted trees and unveiled a bust of Mr. Marti, hero of the struggle for Cuban independence in an earlier time. **********In a lengthy message to ''Cuban internationalists,'' Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos hailed the event as a first step by Cubans ''to end inhuman imperialist exploitation.'' **********And at Cahama, two MIG-23's inaugurated the new airstrip, landing in quick succession, with their parachutes billowing behind them. **********Cuba's Ambassador to Angola, Martin Mora Diaz took part in awarding Orders of Che Guevara to outstanding airport construction workers, Verde Olivo reported."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Amid the hoopla - and criticism - over Kodak's $5.1 billion acquisition of the Sterling Drug Company later that month, the new product went virtually unnoticed. But in a sense, Create-a-Print is more symbolic of the changes at Kodak than is its gargantuan acquisition. **********It took only 22 months for Create-a-Print to go from product idea to market. Design, manufacturing, marketing, all the managers geared up in tandem. They did such things as start on a $250,000 mold to make a key element of the system before they were certain the specifications were perfect. And they did them all on just two say-sos, those of Robert L. Smith, the photofinishing systems division's general manager, and of William J. Janawitz, its manager for manufacturing equipment. **********''In the old days, Create-a-Print would have taken four years,'' Mr. Janawitz said. ''But nowadays, there is a sense of urgency. Everybody knows the future is not as certain as it once was.'' Kodak is in the throes of a cultural upheaval that could serve as a case study for what happens when an old company faces new competitive groundrules. It has changed its internal power structure, its manufacturing methods, its dealings with suppliers and competitors, almost every aspect of how it does business. It has slashed its production costs and fine-tuned its quality assurance systems. And, perhaps most striking at a company that used to view any risk as anathema, it is encouraging its people to take chances for the sake of speed. **********But while the atmosphere at Kodak's State Street headquarters here almost crackles with new-found entrepreneurial energy, the changes have also brought problems. **********Last month, for example, Kodak announced that its innovative nine-volt lithium battery, a product that moved from conception to market in just two and a half years, needs further work to provide the 10-year shelf life the company had claimed for it. In the past, Kodak might well have waited 10 years to bring the product out - a wait that might have meant forgone sales, but would have left the company's reputation for quality unsullied. **********Similarly, Kodak's planned joint venture with Fuqua Industries in photofinishing has been stayed temporarily while the courts sort out the antitrust complaints of smaller competitors. The ''old'' Kodak would have been unlikely to have considered such a joint venture in the first place. **********Investors have lost patience with the company. Kodak's stock has taken several beatings, first when it agreed to Sterling's high price, and again when the Polaroid Corporation said on Feb. 19 that it would ask for $5.7 billion in damages after the courts ruled in its favor in a suit against Kodak for patent infringement. Both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation have recently lowered Kodak's debt ratings. And Kodak's announcement last week that it is offering $1.1 billion of 10-year notes, rather than the $750 million it had originally said it would sell, is not having a calming influence on financial analysts already worried about the company's mounting debt. **********Nor did Kodak's 1987 performance yield huzzahs on the Street. The company's revenues were up 15 percent, to $13.3 billion. Its net earnings, $1.18 billion, were triple those of the prior year. Still, analysts said Kodak had led them to expect earnings even higher than that. In fact, when Kodak announced its fourth-quarter results, Ty Govatos, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, was prompted to warn that, when it comes to disappointing earnings, ''The old Kodak is back.'' **********Despite the barbs, Kodak's executives say they are racing down the right path. ''We must grow, and our internal changes were necessary structural adjustments to assure that growth,'' said Colby H. Chandler, Kodak's chief executive. **********In fact, Kodak has developed a small but nonetheless vocal cadre of supporters among analysts and investors. ''Kodak isn't so concerned about what its earnings will be this quarter, but is looking out to the 1990's,'' said David Presson, an analyst with Edward D. Jones & Company, who continues to recommend Kodak stock. ''And for the long term, it has chosen the right strategy.'' **********Kodak's new peppiness is no aberration; it has been institutionalized. Three years ago Kodak scrapped its centralized organization. It dismantled its huge manufacturing, research and marketing staffs, and created 24 business units, each with a general manager. It made those managers responsible for costs and profits as well as for quality. **********Each manager is now using a team approach to product development. Each is looking at joint ventures and combing the world for low-cost suppliers, once unheard-of concepts in Kodak's do-it-yourself-or-not-at-all culture. And each is trying to come up with the greatest number of new products at the lowest possible cost. **********Indeed, compared with its old lumbering self, Kodak is a whirling dervish. It is spewing forth products at a dizzying speed, 250 in the last two years alone. It has set up a separate venture division to provide seed money and assistance for staffers with ideas for new products. It is embracing new, quicker manufacturing technologies. **********The new pace is evident in all Kodak's business lines. Kodak's newest color copier, introduced on Jan. 13, took only two and a half years from start to finish, just like the lithium battery. But unlike the battery, it has run into no quality complaints. The Fling 35, Kodak's new disposable camera and the first Kodak product designed entirely by CAD (computer-aided design), was ready for market in just six months. **********Even its decision to acquire Sterling was made inordinately quickly, for Kodak. ''We used to be so slow and ponderous, we'd still be talking about whether to buy it, rather than discussing how to integrate it,'' said Kay R. Whitmore, Kodak's president. **********Mr. Chandler seems delighted with the changes. ''We are a high-margin company, and it is new products, not old ones, that have the highest margins,'' he said. **********Still, his pleasure is tempered a bit. Kodak is not the only manufacturing company to compress its product development cycle. Xerox, Ford, Hewlett-Packard and a host of others have all upped their pace in recent years. **********But Kodak, long known as the Great Yellow Father for its cradle-to-grave relationship with its employees, has arguably paid the highest human price. It has been forced to abandon its old attitudes of paternalism toward its own employees and arrogant aloofness toward anyone else. ''It's been hard for some of the old-line executives to accept the need for the change,'' Mr. Chandler said. **********J. Phillip Samper, Kodak's vice chairman and a prime mover behind the reorganization, is more graphic: ''There's been an enormous amount of pain and trauma. And the culture's not completely changed yet.'' **********If any one word could have described Kodak's old culture, it would have been insular. **********Kodak's world was bounded by its Rochester headquarters. It was international in the sense that up to 40 percent of its revenues came from outside the United States. But as far as Kodak was concerned, the only worthwhile ideas or processes were those that originated within its labs and offices. **********Kodak was almost pathologically secretive about its technologies. It rarely bought anything from outside suppliers, partly because it did not trust them to provide the quality the company wanted and partly because it did not want to give away trade secrets. After all, if you let an outsider provide parts, you must first provide it with a reasonable idea of the final product those parts will be used for. ''Kodak didn't trust others, at first for good reasons, later for ostrich reasons,'' said William F. Fowble, vice president of manufacturing. **********Over the years, research, design and manufacturing executives developed an inordinate amount of power at Kodak. They guarded their fiefdoms jealously, and respected each other's turf. And, they called the shots. If research wanted to spend an extra month, even an extra year, coming up with the perfect product, no one raised a voice in protest. ''We used to brag about how long it took us to work on a product,'' recalled one long-time Kodak veteran. **********Because of its reputation for high quality, Kodak was always able to command high prices for its products. Thus, its managers would never tinker with anything that might put quality at risk. While Xerox and other competitors were moving to molded plastic parts on their copiers, Kodak stubbornly stuck with metal components. While other companies were trying to streamline manufacturing processes, Kodak was sticking with the same assembly-line procedures it had always used. **********Indeed, for most of the company's 108-year history, it shied away from being first with anything. Kodak could arguably have given Xerox a run for the dry copier market in the 1960's; instead, Kodak spent a decade putting the finishing touches on its copiers before bringing one to market. It did not set up a mini-processing photo lab of its own until Japanese and French competitors had sold more than 800,000 of them in the United States. **********Throughout the 1970's, Kodak ignored the fact that it was becoming the high-cost producer in many of its markets. In photographic films and papers, where margins are an astonishingly high 70 percent, cost was not an apparent problem. And it simply chose to ignore the problem in its other businesses. ''We'd choose suppliers because they were within 200 miles of Rochester, not because they were low bidders,'' recalled Robert P. Crandall, manager of equipment design and manufacturing for the copy products division. **********Its provincial attitudes spilled over into its marketing. ''When we came into this market in 1970, Kodak just wasn't merchandising film,'' recalled Thomas H. Shay, a spokesman for Fuji Photo Film USA Inc. It was Fuji, not Kodak, that introduced the concepts of multi-roll packages of film and of huge, colorful point-of-sale displays. Kodak has followed suit, but it has never recaptured the 10 percent of market that Fuji managed to grab away. **********A few - very few - Kodak managers were troubled by the company's complacency. In 1971, when Mr. Chandler was director of program planning, he produced a balance sheet and earnings statement for 23 of Kodak's product lines, as a way of checking analytically how the company was deploying resources. He suggested a similar line-of-business reorganization then, but no one much liked the idea. ''The company wasn't ready for it yet,'' he said.  So Kodak continued to suffer from its insularity and caution. By not interacting with outsiders much, it lost touch with its markets and made a series of destructive product decisions. It assumed that 35-millimeter cameras would not catch on with consumers and stopped making them in 1970, effectively handing that market to the Japanese. When it got back into that market in 1985, it had to sell Japanese-made cameras, rather than its own. It assumed the public would never go for instant photography either and let Polaroid run away with that market. When Kodak finally jumped in, Polaroid cried foul, and the courts agreed. Kodak overestimated the market for disk cameras and went into full production on them in 1982; a few months ago it closed its disk camera plant to work off excess inventories. **********It is even playing catch-up with its Fling 35 disposable camera. Although it may have designed it in record time, it did not get started on it nearly soon enough. Fuji has been marketing a 35-millimeter disposable model here for more than a year. And less than two weeks ago Fuji introduced a new disposable product, a 35-millimeter camera with an electronic flash. **********The 1980's brought two things that changed Kodak, probably forever. One was the soaring dollar; the other was Phil Samper. During 14 years overseas, mostly in Latin America, Mr. Samper had seen European and Japanese competitors chip away at Kodak's market share even as Kodak's sales and earnings continued to rise. When he returned to Rochester as a marketing executive in 1976, he was appalled that no one at headquarters was even tracking market share. ''No one had the responsibility,'' he said. **********Mr. Samper initiated a program to take hard looks at Kodak's products and those of competitors, checking them against each other in terms of costs, quality and the like. ''We got the information in, and it wasn't flattering,'' he recalled. **********So in 1980 and 1981, Mr. Samper went on a campaign to shake the company from its complacency. He made a video ''challenging the wonders of the Great Yellow Father,'' and sent it around to employees. He made personal visits to plants, trying to persuade managers that their costs were too high and that their products were growing obsolete. **********''We really raised the ire of Kodak employees, because no one wants to be told they are not the best,'' Mr. Samper said. ''We said, yes, we are a strong company, but the time to correct things is when you are strong.'' **********Actually, Kodak was about to have its strength threatened in ways that even Mr. Samper did not foresee. In the early 1980's, the price of silver, one of Kodak's main raw materials, soared to $50 an ounce. The company never paid that much, but the prospect shook management up more than a bit. **********Silver prices came back down - just in time for the dollar to start its inexorable march upward. By the time the dollar declined last year, it had cost Kodak, by the company's own estimate, more than $3.5 billion in overseas income. **********If the strong dollar had any virtue for Kodak, it was in giving the staff a sense of fallibility. ''The overvalued currency showed us we were on a plateau, set in our ways,'' said Mr. Chandler. Mr. Samper added, ''It is easier to get people to sign onto a culture change in bad times.'' **********But Kodak's culture was not just changed, it was upended. The new profit center structure required an aggressive, competitive attitude that was markedly absent among Kodak's veteran managers. So most new lines of business managers were leapfrogged over the heads of their prior bosses, many of whom left or accepted demotion. **********William J. Prezzano, 47 years old, moved from a slot in international marketing to head Kodak's photographic products group. Charles L. Trowbridge, also 47, was a middle manager in marketing when he was made head of Kodak's copy products division. **********Bill Fowble, 49, was far down the manufacturing hierarchy when he was named the head of manufacturing. Kodak's manufacturing people now must underbid outside suppliers to provide anything other than photographic films and paper, and top management felt that Mr. Fowble had the right attitude for that. ''We had to throw out the seniority process, because we wanted to take the strongest people we had,'' Mr. Samper said. **********To make matters worse, the reorganization dovetailed with a company-wide downsizing, in which managers were told to cut their budgets 5 percent, their work forces 10 percent. Merit increases were canceled. Many workers took early retirement; others simply lost their jobs. By the end of 1986, Kodak was down more than 12,700 jobs. **********Kodak may have to do yet more belt-tightening. The Sterling acquisition brought Kodak's debt load to 55 percent of total capitalization, up from just 35 percent before the acquisition. ''The acquisition dilutes their earnings and creates an extraordinary amount of leverage on their balance sheet,'' said Eugene G. Glaser, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, who went from a ''buy'' recommendation to neutral on Kodak stock. **********In mid-February, a group of Kodak and Sterling executives, led by Mr. Whitmore, met with analysts in an attempt to persuade them that the company's earnings would continue to soar in 1988 and that the Sterling acquisition would provide so many marketing strengths and economies of scale that it would begin to pay off as early as 1989. **********Many Wall Streeters accept that Sterling brings valuable distribution and product strengths to Kodak. Sterling counts such well-known brands as Bayer aspirin, Lysol cleaners and Mop & Glo in its vast stable of prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medicines and household products. Still, they question whether Kodak might not have found those same strengths at a lower price. ''This was like buying a dog to pin the tail on,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache. **********Mr. Chandler, the chairman, disagrees vehemently. He notes that Kodak already has a $1 billion health care business. In addition to its sizable X-ray machine and film business, Kodak holds the patents on natural Vitamin E and already makes a number of pharmaceuticals. The company continues to systematically screen its roster of more than 500,000 proprietary chemical compounds for medical use. **********''For us, the Sterling price was a good price,'' he said. ''For I.B.M. or G.E., it would be a bad price. But we have the synergies to justify it. We bring scientific skills, Sterling brings marketing strengths.'' **********Perhaps most important, pharmaceuticals are a high-margin business, and high margins in industries that are not easy to get into are what Kodak is all about. ''Health care is the highest-margin business of the future with a high cost of entry,'' Mr. Chandler said. **********He may be right - but Kodak's photographic products people are not ready to give up the top spot. ''Last year we had the largest percentage of growth in 10 years in color negative exposures, and that's the biggest barometer of photographic products health,'' said Mr. Prezzano, who has committed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to modernizing film operations. ''That does not suggest this is an industry that is plateauing.'' **********Still, Mr. Prezzano is no ostrich. For example, he has set up a separate electronics division in his group to work on electronic cameras, which do not use film at all and thus could some day cannibalize Kodak's silver halide photography business. **********Kodak is taking a closer look at its other photographic businesses, too. For example, it has made a good deal of money supplying photographic papers and chemicals to other photofinishers, but photofinishing itself has never been particularly profitable for the company. **********That is why it wants to merge its photofinishing businesses with those of Fuqua. If the merger is allowed to go through, it will create the world's largest photoprocessing company.Fuqua will manage the new business, as well as own 51 percent of it. ''We wanted to maintain a presence in photofinishing, but letting Fuqua run it makes it look less like we are competing with our own customers,'' Mr. Prezzano explained. **********Such competitive conflicts are not a problem in the 10-year-old copier division. But Mr. Trowbridge, too, is taking a realistic look at potential problems. ''This has already become a replacement business,'' he said. ''We see the total optical copier market slowing and finally declining in the 90's. What will substitute will be multi-function devices.'' Mr. Trowbridge already is pursuing an electronic printing project. **********Meanwhile, Kodak continues to pursue its cultural change. It has a steady stream of professors and consultants teaching its people new ways to manage. It has elevated its blue-collar workers to the status of team members, and elicited productivity improvement suggestions from them. **********But whether Kodak will keep the right stream of products flowing at the right pace remains to be seen. The Great Yellow Father is acting like a feisty teen-ager - but in adolescence, growth has always been a painful process.

The following are some of the key deals.  Jan. 22, 1988. Kodak announces its largest and most controversial acquisition ever: Sterling Drug, a maker of prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter drugs and a variety of household cleaning products. It will pay $5.1 billion.  Dec. 7, 1987. Kodak and Fuqua Industries agree to merge their United States photofinishing operations, creating the world's largest photofinishing company. Fuqua will manage the joint venture, which will use Kodak materials. (The agreement has been temporarily stayed by a Federal court.)  Nov. 12, 1987. Kodak and Digital Equipment agree to market jointly the Kodak information management system, which uses Kodak software and hardware provided by both companies.  Aug. 6, 1987. Kodak buys one-fourth of Genencor, a San Francisco-based biotechnology company. The other owners are Genentech, Staley and Corning Glass.  July 7, 1987. Kodak and theJU Tokyo-based Imagica Corporation form a photofinishing joint venture in Japan. The venture will use Kodak materials.  Sept. 17, 1986. Kodak reorganizes its consumer electronics division into a new profit center called the electronic photography division, which will concentrate on electronic products and systems that do not use Kodak's mainstay silver halide photographic processes. For now, the division will focus on commercial and industrial applications.  May 22, 1986. Kodak gives one of its small ''venture'' operations, Ultra Technologies, full status as a business unit in its Photographic Products Group. The company was created to develop Kodak's lithium nine-volt consumer-use battery.  May 15, 1986. Kodak and Cytogen agree to jointly develop and market products for diagnosing and treating cancer.  Feb. 27, 1986. Kodak and Amgen, which specializes in genetic engineering, agree to work jointly on specialty chemicals, for which Kodak would have manufacturing and marketing rights.  Jan. 31, 1986. Kodak forms the Eastman Kodak Credit Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary to provide long-term financing for Kodak customers and to lease them Kodak equipment.  Dec. 18, 1985. Kodak and Nova Pharmaceutical agree to use Nova's receptor screening system to analyze selected items from Kodak's library of 500,000 chemical compounds to see which ones might have pharmaceutical applications.  June 13, 1985. Kodak acquires Verbatim, a maker of floppy disks for personal computers. The company is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary.  March 5, 1985. Kodak buys into Japan's Chinon Industries, and announces it will sell Chinon's 35-millimeter cameras under the Kodak name."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/10/business/what-s-new-in-specialty-beers-the-mellow-art-of-the-micro-brewer.html": {"writer_name": "A.

Even though sales of these micro-beers doubled last year, to 100,000 barrels, their share of the American market of 178 million barrels a year market remains minuscule. But fans maintain these brews are beerdom's last bastion of quality. **********Jack McAuliffe, a former Navy electrician and beer enthusiast, is loosely credited with giving birth to the American micro-brewing industry in 1977, when he began the New Albion Brewery in Sonoma, Calif., producing British-style ales and stouts. But after three years of losses, Mr. McAuliffe closed down. **********His vision, however, lives on. Today more than 75 micro-brewers are operating in barns, basements and backyards from New England to Southern California. Another 36 or so have sprung up in Canada. By the end of the decade, according to the American Homebrewers Association, there could be as many as 200 micro-brewers in the United States alone. Capitalizing on the sudden interest in specialty beers, several new labels from overseas have started to appear on American store shelves and restaurant menus. **********''Many Americans are beginning to recognize what they've been >missing in beer,'' said Alan Eames of Chesterfield, N.H., a marketing representative for Guinness, the British brewing house, and author of ''A Beer Drinker's Companion,'' soon to be published by Ayers Rock Press. ''The micro-brewing phenomenon is a response to that trend.'' **********By definition, a micro-brewer is one who produces and sells no more than 15,000 barrels of beer a year - although most micros turn out far less than that. A subset of micro-brewing, the craft brewer, is defined as one producing fewer than 3,000 barrels a year. The smallest of the micros are the pub brewers - tavern keepers or restaurateurs who brew just enough for their customers, usually only a few hundred barrels a year. **********Micro-beer prices vary among brands, but tend to hover somewhere above the midscale Millers and Michelobs and below the upscale Amstels and Heinekens. Getting space on crowded liquor store shelves is always a challenge, but micro-brewers generally find acceptance at restaurants and bars close to home. **********''There's a certain cachet associated with micro-brewing,'' said Mr. Eames, who provides technical and marketing assistance to small brewers and importers. ''A few years ago people were falling over themselves to invest in vineyards and micro-wineries. Today the action has shifted over to brewing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/26/business/cyberpunks-seek-thrills-in-computerized-mischief.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1988-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cyberpunks Seek Thrills In Computerized Mischief", "print_headline": "Cyberpunks Seek Thrills In Computerized Mischief", "body_text": " **********A policeman patrolling after midnight in a Silicon Valley shopping mall recently witnessed an unusual sight, even for this center of high technology: two teen-agers wedged in a phone booth, laboring over the keyboard of a laptop computer clipped into the telephone line. **********The youths, who were arrested for telephone fraud and computer abuse and are being held in jail here, belong to a shadowy culture of computer ''hackers'' committed to illegally entering - and frequently tampering with - the computer networks that American society has come to rely on. **********The hackers in this expanding underground have broken into corporate and military computers and tampered with telephone billing and switching equipment, sometimes altering services and monitoring telephone lines.

Rosenblatt, head of the high-technology unit of the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting the Washington teen-agers. ''It's a question of deterrence. We have to do something or we'll have hundreds of these yo-yos.'' **********Mr. Rosenblatt said his agency spends as much 30 percent of its time trying to fight computer hackers and those who tamper with the telephone system. He said that in the last year a tougher attitude toward computer hacking by law enforcement officials and corporate security officers had resulted in dozens of arrests. In a number of cases, ''sting'' operations were set up in which police and telephone company officials masqueraded as hackers to snare offenders. Illegal Communications **********The cyberpunks live in a hidden electronic world in which they do not submit to interviews in person. When they call on the telephone to describe their activities, it is often via a call placed with stolen credit cards, or with illegal technology that permits manipulation of the phone system. Sometimes the communications are via voice-mail systems, which permit storing and retrieving telephone messages, or anonymous messages posted on electronic ''bulletin boards.'' **********''Phreaking is moral,'' said an 18-year old California hacker who calls himself ''Frank Drake'' in messages he leaves on the bulletin boards. ''There is no theft involved. It's not theft of services, because this equipment would otherwise be idle.'' **********Frank Drake edits a small newsletter called ''W.O.R.M.,'' which he calls ''a magazine for cyberpunks.'' It lists a post-office box address in San Mateo, Calif. Those who want to reach him call a voice-mail system telephone number in the San Francisco Bay area, where they can leave a message. **********He argues that most underground hackers are interested only in exploring the computer systems that are linked by networks, not in destroying data or tying up machines so they cannot be used. **********It was Frank Drake who telephoned at midnight one day recently and set up a conference call with another person he identified as an East Coast hacker who called himself Thomas. Stock Computer Claim **********Thomas described himself as a member of a group named ''the Legion of Doom,'' and said he had recently taken an interest in computers used by banking and investment firms. He asserted that he had entered several computers used for stock trading applications. He did not describe what he did after entering the computers, nor did he identify the institutions involved. **********Thomas said he had developed a formula to avoid being caught: ''I keep to myself and don't place multiple calls to the same phone number.'' He said he was not motivated by any desire to destroy or steal. ''I love to learn things,'' he explained. **********As with most cyberpunks, it is difficult to verify the claims of Frank Drake and Thomas. **********There are no clear estimates of how many hackers spend their time using personal computers and modems - devices that convert computer data so that it can pass over phone lines - to enter remote machines illicitly. However, both computer security experts and members of the hacker community suggest that they number in the thousands in the United States alone. Tricking Company Officials **********In many cases, special programming skills are required to enter telephone and computer systems illegally. But hackers sometimes place telephone calls to computer system operators at a target company and trick them into divulging information about the company's computer system. The hackers call this ''social engineering.'' **********Thomas claimed to be a skilled social engineer, saying he had successfully convinced various computer system operators to give him passwords and other information. Sometimes the social engineers pose as telecommunications or computer security investigators working on a case. **********In recent months, the computer virus, a malicious program that can be passed unnoticed from computer to computer, has become the best-known manifestation of the cyberpunks' activities. Instruction on Creating Viruses **********Although virus programs are not new, they have only recently been perceived as serious threats, and cyberpunks have shown a particular interest in them. Articles describing how to write viruses have appeared in several publications that are widely circulated within the underground. **********Writing in the journal 2600, which says it speaks for the computer underground, an author using the pseudonym ''The Plague'' described how to create a virus. ''If people's data is destroyed, then so be it,'' he wrote. ''If people are stupid enough to accept pirated software, then they deserve to be punished.'' **********Despite efforts by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to stop its spread, copies of the Arpanet program written by Mr. Morris of Cornell have become collectors' items for hackers, say those who follow the activities of the underground. 'Misfits and Losers' **********Computer experts working in the industry who have become involved with malicious hackers see them as computer addicts possessed by an anti-social obsession. **********''They're misfits, losers or troubled individuals lacking a sense of duty or morals,'' said a computer researcher at a Silicon Valley research institution. In recent years this researcher has offered four underground hackers programming jobs in an effort to channel their energy away from destructive use of computers. In each case the experiment ended in failure, he said. **********The researcher asked not to be identified, and his reason is revealing. He fears that the cyberpunks are so skilled at tampering with computers that they might be able to alter his credit rating or have his electricity turned off. **********''Every single one of them had deep psychological problems,'' he said. **********Some members of the hacker underground appear to agree with his psychological assessment. **********''They have this crazed need to find the answer,'' said Eric Corley, editor of 2600. Mr. Corley, whose personal hacking resulted in three brushes with the law before he started the publication in 1984, said: ''They keep exploring where they know they shouldn't go. A true hacker won't stop just because he gets in trouble.'' **********Although computer experts believe the number of outlaw hackers is growing, the behavior they exhibit is not new to the high-tech world. Recalling 'Captain Crunch' **********For example, a computer programmer, John Draper, spent six months in jail during the 1970's for illegal use of the telephone network. Mr. Draper's nickname, ''Captain Crunch,'' derived from his discovery that a whistle that came as a prize in a cereal box was tuned to the correct frequency to unlawfully manipulate telephone company switching gear. **********After getting out of jail Mr. Draper wrote Easy Writer, a popular word-processing program that was the first such package available for the I.B.M. PC. Despite the financial success of the program, he was charged last year with belonging to a group counterfeiting tickets of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Mr. Draper pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and is on probation. **********Mr. Draper said that the underground computer culture had changed for the worse in recent years. ''It's not elite any more,'' he said. ''Computer hackers have proliferated because information is so much easier to obtain.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/31/business/in-quotes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN QUOTES", "print_headline": "IN QUOTES", "body_text": " **********''In New York the distinction between hostile and friendly takeovers has been very much blurred.'' - Yoshiji Fukushima, executive vice president, Nomura Securities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/16/world/for-sri-lanka-an-agonizing-election.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 734, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Sri Lanka, an Agonizing Election", "print_headline": "For Sri Lanka, an Agonizing Election", "body_text": " **********On Monday this small country, trapped for years in cycles of ethnic violence, faces what many describe as its most crucial election. **********But the citizens of a land that was once a democratic model for Asia will vote in four days, if they dare, under conditions that make a free and fair election virtually impossible, by most accounts. **********In the voting, Sri Lankans will be asked to choose a successor to President J. R. Jayewardene, who is retiring after half a century of public service. **********Mr. Jayewardene's United National Party has nominated the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa, as its presidential candidate. He is being challenged by Sirimavo Bandaranaike, a former Prime Minister, under the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party. A coalition of leftist parties is fielding a political newcomer, Ossie Abeygoonasekara. New Forms of Violence **********Since Mr. Jayewardene decided in September not to run, Sri Lanka has been battered by new forms of violence and terror. The causes of this breakdown in the social order are numerous, complex and often confusing. **********After several years of fighting guerrillas representing Tamils, the country's largest ethnic minority, the Jayewardene Government became the target of Sinhalese extremists, drawn from the ethnic majority. **********The Sinhalese militants, or those purporting to support that cause, have capitalized on opposition to Mr. Jayewardene's decision to bring Indian troops into Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm the Tamils. The Sinhalese militants want the Indian troops to leave and oppose concessions to Tamils. **********The Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, make up 74 percent of Sri Lanka's 17.5 million people and predominate in the Government. The Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, constitute 17 percent of the population and are most numerous in the north and east of the island. **********There have been reports, taken seriously by both Indian and Sri Lankan officials, that the Sinhalese militants are being assisted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the last group of northern separatists holding out against the 50,000 Indian troops. They also seek an end to Indian military involvement in Sri Lanka. **********In the last six weeks in Sinhalese areas, people have been dying at the rate of 25 to 50 a day at the hands of Sinhalese guerrillas trying to force the cancellation of the election, or increasingly repressive troops and paramilitary forces armed with sweeping extra-democratic powers, or mysterious vigilantes known as ''anti-subversive subversives.'' **********Public services in many areas in the south are now run by soldiers, who are rounding up thousands of young Sri Lankans in a region that was peaceful until last year, when Indian troops arrived to disarm ethnic Tamils in the north and east. The north is now, paradoxically, a safer part of the country. Social Disruption Widespread **********In Colombo and most of the Sinhalese areas, schools and universities are closed. Local administrations have ceased to function. Electricity is cut off intermittently, garbage piles up, and shops are shut under threats from militants, who have also engineered a series of dramatic prison escapes. **********The militants threaten to bring the country to a standstill this weekend and through the election Monday with a general strike and campaign of intimidation intended to keep people at home. **********Many Sri Lankans contend that the election should not be held, but if it is not, the Government will be seen to have bowed to terrorism. **********If it is held, and the Government candidate wins, more violence will almost certainly follow, politicians of all views say. Militants have warned that they will not accept the election results. Many Sri Lankans who do not share the miltiants' views nevertheless agree that it will be difficult to hold a fair election when ballots have been burned and election offices closed in many towns. **********The campaign against the Government and the election is thought to be led by the People's Liberation Front or its military wing. **********The front and its leader, Rohana Wijeweera, are not new to Sri Lankan life. In 1971 the front, then promoting itself as a Marxist movement, led a brief revolution that was quickly and brutally crushed by Mrs. Bandaranaike's Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/28/business/finance-briefs-066388.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** First Federal Savings Bank of Puerto Rico plans to issue $50 million of certificates of deposits at 3 percent above the Consumer Price Index to institutional investors. *********** First Fidelity Bancorp. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf registration of up to $500 million in debt securities and warrants to buy debt securities. *********** General Electric Capital Corp. is issuing an 8 1/4 percent $300 million Eurobond, priced at 101.20 and due in 1991, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. *********** Procter & Gamble Co. is issuing a 7 3/8 percent $100 million Eurobond priced at 100.75 and due in 1989 through underwriters led by Goldman Sachs International Corp. *********** Sequa Corp. offered $250 million of 10.5 percent, 10-year subordinated notes through Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear, Stearns & Co.

After being crushed in legislative elections in March, his Christian Democratic party has split into bickering factions and may well lose the Presidential election next year. **********On being informed that he would probably die later this year, Mr. Duarte immediately began what he appears to have thought was his last effort to recover some of the ground he has lost. **********''He believed he would die and so he called in his advisers and said 'let's plan for the future,' '' a close friend of Mr. Duarte said. ''He told us not to worry, that the trauma had passed and that we had to work.'' Departure to U.S. Delayed **********Mr. Duarte then delayed his departure for three days in order to meet with virtually every important group in the country except leftist guerrilla representatives, his friends said. He called on all he met to seek national unity and to support efforts to democratize the country, they said. **********Mr. Duarte repeated that message in a long letter to the National Assembly and in another letter to his bitterly divided Christian Democratic party that have been made public in recent days. **********He told his fellow party members to ''recognize our errors and have the courage necessary to correct them,'' especially emphasizing the need to reunify the party. ''The future of our fatherland is in your hands,'' he warned his party. **********Mr. Duarte also wrote a letter to the army high command that has not been made public, but that his aides say is an appeal to the army to keep supporting the election of civilian governments and to respect human rights. Mr. Duarte's closest friends say he considered the statements to be his final political testament. **********That is a conclusion shared by most Salvadoran political leaders who now speak of Mr. Duarte in the past tense and, when asked to assess his political legacy, have to struggle, to put aside the strong partisan feelings Mr. Duarte has always aroused. 'He Started a Process' **********''For me, his period has ended,'' said a close friend of Mr. Duarte. ''History will judge him positively. He started a process - a tendency towards democracy.'' **********Mr. Duarte's many rightist opponents and the Marxist guerrillas who have fought his Government are unlikely to be so positive in their final assessments. Rightists have regularly accused Mr. Duarte of being a Communist and running a corrupt party. Leftists accuse him of being a warmonger and an American puppet. **********Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, an extreme rightist political columnist, accused Mr. Duarte of faking his illness because he did not have the courage to take responsibility for what he has done to the country. **********In fact, it appears too early to judge Mr. Duarte's legacy to El Salvador. If his term in office proves to have been the start of real democratization, Mr. Duarte is likely to be lauded as a courageous political pioneer. **********If El Salvador falls into deeper war and repression, Mr. Duarte is likely to be seen as a flawed leader who squandered a fleeting opportunity to move his country forward. **********At present, his Government is widely judged as inefficient and many of Mr. Duarte's ministers are suspected of being corrupt. Mr. Duarte sharply reduced human rights abuses by the army, but never was able to stamp them out or punish guilty officers. **********He was badly beaten, then exiled by the army after he won the presidential election in 1972. Returning to join an army-run junta in 1980, Mr. Duarte tolerated mass killings by the army in what he said he saw as a necessary pact that would one day allow him to tame the army and remove military elements in the Government. Gap of Mistrust **********Mr. Duarte appears never to have forgiven the army or the upper class for supporting decades of dictatorship that he charges caused the Marxist insurgency. **********A close friend said he had tried repeatedly to encourage talks between Mr. Duarte and conservative businessmen, but that the gap of mistrust and resentment was too wide. **********The friend said Mr. Duarte referred to the programs of land redistribution, nationalization of banks and nationalization of export crops as ''the three reforms'' under his tenure. **********The friend said Mr. Duarte then listed ''the fourth reform'' - that from now on ''the president makes the decisions in El Salvador,'' instead of the upper class and the army. Talks With Rebels **********His highest point of political power was a first attempt to negotiate with the rebels at the village of La Palma in 1984. That effort has withered in the years since. **********But while the rebels' military commanders keep fighting, Mr. Duarte has permitted rebel civilian leaders to come home and actively pursue their alternative political vision. **********Mr. Duarte's political decline began when the rebels kidnapped his daughter in late 1985. He forced the army to release more than 100 rebel prisoners to win his daughter's freedom, a deal the army criticized as surrender. **********Mr. Duarte then seemed to lose his touch. He told friends that simply finishing his term and seeing in a new elected government was the most he could hope to achieve. **********Mr. Duarte's critics say that step is not enough to save a country in crisis.

Ten percent of that aid would be spent for weapons and ammunition; the rest would be used for food, medicine, spare parts and transportation. **********The vote in the House of Representatives, which is expected Wednesday, is considered to be extremely close. Perhaps two dozen moderates from both parties hold the key to the outcome, and they have been bombarded in recent days by television commercials in their districts, visits from church groups and campaign supporters, and invitations to meet personally with the President and his top advisers. Point of Democrats **********The question of how best to encourage democratic change in Nicaragua has become a central argument between the Administration and foes of contra aid. While Mr. Reagan says that continued military pressure is essential, Democrats argue that such pressure would kill the peace process, not advance it. **********Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, delivering the Democrats' response to the President, said, ''The way to greater freedom in Nicaragua is not greater firepower for the contras.'' **********''The President's policy will not bring pressure for peace, but the escalation of war,'' said Mr. Gephardt, a candidate for his party's Presidential nomination. ''The Administration wants to capture Nicaragua.'' **********The selection of Mr. Gephardt to deliver today's address demonstrates how the contra aid issue has become deeply enmeshed in the Presidential campaign. 'Politically Charged Issue' **********''Contra aid is the most politically charged issue around,'' said a senior White House official. ''The opposition is pretty strident, and I assume they see a political gain in it.'' **********The Democrats say they are on the right side of the issue politically, because public opinion polls consistently show that voters oppose aid to the contras by about two to one. **********Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, pointed out that Mr. Gephardt was making contra aid an increasingly important part of his campaign in Iowa, a state known for liberal views on foreign policy. **********However, the White House points out, if the aid proposal is defeated, the Democrats will then have to take the political responsibility for events in Central America. Risk Cited **********''There's obviously a risk to defeating this package,'' said a White House strategist. ''The opponents would be saddled with the consequences, good or bad.'' **********Democratic leaders acknowledge this risk, and have tried to minimize it by promising lawmakers that if the President's request were shelved, a new proposal containing strictly non-military assistance would be quickly offered. **********Many moderates are reluctant to cut off all aid to the contras, and are seeking some ''political cover,'' said Mr. Bonior. **********In addition, the Democrats are worried about what would happen if they do win, and are blamed for what then happens in the region. Details Not Yet Set **********''What we're saying is, we don't want to get caught with our pants down,'' said Representative Tony Coelho, the Democratic whip. ''We want a program for Central America that makes sense.'' **********Mr. Coelho said details of the Democrats' alternative were not yet set, but it would probably provide for aid channelled through an international organization, such as the Red Cross. ''If we have a plan, we are protected if Ortega does something,'' he said. **********President Reagan has made the contra aid issue his top priority, according to his aides. He is making telephone calls to swing lawmakers this weekend, as are many of his key advisers, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci. **********Mr. Reagan will address the issue again Monday, in a speech to a group of religious broadcasters, and he plans a nationally televised message Tuesday night, on the eve of the House vote. 'Every Rock and Every Stone' **********''We are turning over every rock and every stone to find every available vote,'' said a senior White House official. **********White House officials say the vote will not only affect the situation in Central America, it will provide the first important test of the President's strength on Capitol Hill as he begins his final year in office. ''We don't want to lose - badly,'' said the senior aide. **********Democrats point out that the President has spoken many times about the contras, and they argue that ''his clout on this issue is pretty well exhausted,'' in the words of Mr. Bonior. **********However, the Democratic leader added, the President is still in a position to offer specific inducements to wavering legislators. ''I suspect he can buy a few votes for a project here and there,'' said Mr. Bonior. ''Some guys can't wait to get an invitation to go down there with a list of things they want.'' Arguments on Both Sides **********One White House aide, asked if such promises were being traded for votes, replied: ''I hope so.'' **********But the heart of the lobbying battle is the arguments being made on both sides. Mr. Reagan is saying that his view of the Sandinistas has shifted, and that he is now encouraged about the chances for peaceful change in Nicaragua, according to aides who have attended meetings with key lawmakers. **********Mr. Reagan, these aides say, believes that the Sandinistas still want to exert total control over Nicaragua but that a combination of military pressure from the contras and economic pressure from a slumping business climate have forced the Sandinistas to make concessions. **********''The President is encouraged by what Ortega did,'' said one adviser, who was referring to Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader. ''It appears the Sandinistas have opened the door to democracy; now we must close the door behind them.'' **********This line of argument is crucial to Mr. Reagan's assertion that he now seeks a political solution in Central America, not a military one. According to his aides, he no longer believes, as he once did, that his only goal in the region is to make the Sandinistas ''cry uncle.'' **********Democrats express serious doubts, however, that Mr. Reagan has changed his basic view of the Sandinistas, and they say his argument is merely a cosmetic one, designed to win sympathy and votes from lawmakers who prefer a negotiated settlement. **********''I'm very skeptical,'' said Mr. Bonior. ''I believe he wants the Sandinistas gone before he leaves office. I don't think he's changed his policies on that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/market-place-biotechnology-loses-luster.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1988-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Biotechnology Loses Luster", "print_headline": "Market Place; Biotechnology Loses Luster", "body_text": " **********BIOTECHNOLOGY stocks, once a glamorous investment, are in the doldrums. The result, analysts said, could be increased takeover activity within the industry and bargain-hunting opportunities for patient investors. **********In contrast to some other stocks, biotechnology stocks have not recovered from the October market crash. The index of 64 biotech stocks compiled by Biotech Investor, a New York investment advisory newsletter, fell 3.2 percent from the end of October through May 20. By comparison, the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose half of 1 percent in the period and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 13.2 percent. **********Several factors account for this, but the main one is that for most biotechnology companies, true earnings from product sales are a few years in the future, and in a bear market, investors are not willing to invest as much in promises. **********''Companies with earnings have done well but development stage companies are rocking along the bottom,'' said James McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif. He noted that institutional ownership of many biotechnology companies had dropped since the market crash. **********A plunge in the stock price of the leading biotechnology company, Genentech Inc., has also thrown ''a wet blanket over the whole group,'' said Jeffrey W. Casdin, the publisher of Biotech Investor. Genentech's stock, which reached a high of $47.50 earlier this year, closed Friday at $25.625. **********Unlike the other companies involved in genetic engineering, Genentech already has products on the market, including tissue plasminogen activator, the new blood clot dissolver that is expected to have the highest first-year sales of any drug in history. Still, analysts have been peeling back their estimates of the sales because of unclear data from studies on the drug and the likely resistance among some health care providers to its high price of $2,300 a dose. **********Genentech's stock was buffeted again late last week as word circulated about a major study on T.P.A. in Europe that could spur T.P.A.'s competitor, streptokinase, which is made by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. and the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, which has a license to sell the product from Kabi Vitrum of Sweden. **********Jeffrey R. Swarz, a biotechnology analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he had learned that the study, involving 5,000 heart attack victims, showed that T.P.A. reduced the rate of mortality after 30 days by about 20 percent, not significantly greater than the 18 percent reduction streptokinase had shown in an earlier trial. That could make streptokinase, which is one-tenth the price of T.P.A., a stronger competitor and could force Genentech to lower T.P.A.'s price, Mr. Swarz said. **********Fred Hoar, a spokesman for Genentech, said the company could not comment on the unpublished study yet. But he said that it would be inappropriate to compare the T.P.A. test with the results of the streptokinase study. **********Uncertainty over patents is also casting a cloud over the biotechnology industry. The Cetus Corporation, for example, which is banking heavily on the anti-cancer drug interleukin-2, suffered a setback in April when a United States patent on the substance was granted to the Ajinomoto Company of Japan, which has licensed American rights to Hoffmann-La Roche. **********The depressed market is also likely to make it harder for young companies to get the capital they need to continue product development. Earlier this month, for instance, the NeoRx Corporation of Seattle, the first major biotechnology company to try to go public since the market crash, withdrew its offer when it appeared as if it would not get the price it wanted. **********Low stock prices and the inability to raise money on the market could in turn bring about a flurry of mergers and equity investments in small companies by large ones. Stuart Weisbrod, a biotechnology analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, thinks that Biogen N.V., Cetus and Centocor Inc. would be the most likely takeover targets. **********Meanwhile, analysts say there are some buying opportunities for investors who are patient. **********Mr. McCamant of the Medical Technology Stock Letter said some stocks are now ''ridiculously cheap.'' Synergen Inc. closed Friday at $6.625 a share, half the price that Eli Lilly & Company paid for a stake two years ago. California Biotechnology Inc. is selling for close to its book value. **********Mr. McCamant also likes the Xoma Corporation, which is expected to seek approval within the year to market two products. Its stock closed Friday at $10.50, compared with a 52-week high of $25. **********Mr. Weisbrod of Prudential-Bache is recommending no stocks for short-term gains, but a few for long-term appreciation. One is Centocor, which is considered the leader in a branch of biotechnology known as monoclonal antibodies. Another is Applied Biosystems, which sells equipment for use by biotechnology companies.

The Government spokesman said there had never been a policy of free hospitalization. **********On Tuesday, administrators of the nine Government hospitals in the West Bank were notified that the hospitals will charge about $175 a night, double the previous fee, no matter what medical problem the patient has. **********Patients will have to pay for three days in advance, the doctors said, and then sign a document binding them to any remaining accounts. **********The doctors also reported that the military governor told them that Arabs wounded in the uprising would no longer be excluded from paying. All building projects at Government hospitals in the West Bank were halted, too, they said, and exemptions for low-income patients had been canceled. **********They also asserted that they were informed that patients could no longer be transferred to hospitals inside Israel. **********But Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the military government, which Israel calls the Civil Administration, said Palestinians could still seek treatment unobtainable in the West Bank at Israeli hospitals, provided they pay for it themselves. He said the rules were ''new, internal regulations in order to cope with the financial situation.'' **********''The Civil Administration has encountered financial difficulties,'' Mr. Rafowicz said. ''Some of the reasons are the business strikes, the decrease in income and less taxes'' that resulted from the uprising, he added. **********''But if you want to say this is a new policy linked to the intifada, it's not,'' Mr. Rafowicz said emphatically, using the Arabic word for uprising. ''Many people who received medical treatment in the past simply haven't paid.'' **********The public health system inside Israel has been on the brink of financial collapse for several years. Government hospitals have been crippled by striking doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians and maintenance workers seeking rises. **********Medical costs for nearly 90 percent of Israelis are paid by the country's national insurance or through membership in one of several socialized health funds.

Fernando Matthei, who has headed the air force since 1978, said the choice facing Chilean voters was ''not dictatorship or democracy; either road leads to democracy.'' **********He said that if General Pinochet won a new eight-year term, he would retire as army commander and govern as a civilian, accompanied by a Congress to be elected in 1989 and by the increasingly free press. **********If the political opposition defeats General Pinochet, he said, the plebiscite will be followed by competitive presidential elections as promised, as well as the election of Congress and a free press. Differs With Opposition **********''The choice is democracy or democracy,'' he said, differing from the interpretation of the organized opposition, which has adopted the stance that democracy will come only after General Pinochet is defeated. **********Nevertheless, General Matthei expressed frustration at the inability of Chileans ''to come out of the trenches and reach a consensus position'' that would allow a less confrontational transition from the 15-year-old rule of the armed forces. **********Discussing the failed attempts at direct negotiations over the last three years, he said, ''At first, the opposition told the armed forces that to talk to them we would have to come with our resignations in hand.'' **********Although the armed forces had broad public support when they overturned Salvador Allende Gossens' Socialist-Communist coalition in 1973, he said, ''we have never had the recognition by the opposition parties of the legitimacy of this Government.'' **********''During all these years,'' he continued, ''the only option the opposition has planted is that nothing that has been done is valid, and the opposition has still not been able to come down from that tree.'' **********But he also said, ''The intransigence comes from both sides.'' **********''The Government has not looked for consensus, either,'' he said. ''We have not done our part. Military men are not made for that. It may not be good, but that's the way we are.'' **********Although recently ''some politicians have recognized something good of this Government,'' he said, it was probably too late to find the ''consensus candidate'' that he and some other military commanders have often said they were seeking to become a transitional president. Nomination by Armed Forces **********Under the terms of the 1980 Constitution, General Matthei and the commanders of the army, the navy and the national police, including General Pinochet as head of the army, are to unanimously nominate someone to run for an eight-year term in a one-candidate plebiscite late this year. If that candidate loses, open presidential elections are to be called within a year. **********The commanders may nominate anyone, military or civilian, but the candidate is expected to be General Pinochet, who has made known his desire to continue in power and has been campaigning for more than a year. The three other commanders have made clear that they would prefer to nominate someone else, but they do not want an open confrontation with General Pinochet and the army. **********General Matthei did not criticize General Pinochet directly in the interview but noted that all of the military leaders except General Pinochet were ready to get out of politics. **********''I have no political interest or ambition,'' he said, ''The President yes, the rest of us no.'' General May Retire **********General Matthei, at the age of 62 a decade younger than General Pinochet, said that if the military-nominated candidate won the plebiscite, he intended to retire as air force commander after the inauguration March 11. If the opposition wins, he said, he would probably remain as commander until March 1990, by which time the presidential and congressional elections would have been held. **********The four-man military junta, which performs legislative functions, is supposed to disappear in March 1990. **********General Matthei said the military leadership was going ahead with the plebiscite despite the fact that current polls give no assurance of victory to either side. That raises a risk he said he did not like - that the defeat of General Pinochet would look like a rejection of all the armed forces. **********He said the main accomplishment of the military leadership had been to return ''economic and social liberty'' to Chile after the Allende Government's attempts to put the state in control of most of the economy. ''Now,'' he said, ''we want to return political liberty.'' Economic Successes Cited **********He cited successes of the free-market economy - with high growth and rapidly expanding exports - after tough periods in which many people lost their jobs. He said the armed forces had taken a country that was ''really bankrupt in every way'' and made it into ''a country that works.'' **********While many critics have accused Chile's leadership of ignoring the poor and merely improving the situation of the affluent, he contended that it had created an ''impersonal economy'' in which the old landed families and industrialists long accustomed to subsidies and tariff protection were forced to become competitive or go out of business. **********He said the oil and foreign debt crises had made it crucial for Chile to become an aggressive trading nation. He said the days were gone when the Government ''could commit whatever economic foolishness and copper would always pay the bill.'' **********''If the politicians win big in the plebiscite and try to change what we have accomplished with the economy,'' he said, ''the people will soon realize which was the better government.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/22/business/company-news-hoffmann-raises-sterling-bid-to-81.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1988-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 460, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOFFMANN RAISES STERLING BID TO $81", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HOFFMANN RAISES STERLING BID TO $81", "body_text": " **********Sweetening its hostile takeover bid for the second time in three days, Hoffmann-La Roche & Company, the big Swiss drug producer, offered yesterday to pay $81 a share, or nearly $4.7 billion in cash, for Sterling Drug Inc., manufacturers of Bayer aspirin. **********Wall Street professionals said Hoffman-La Roche was putting Sterling's directors under pressure to negotiate.

St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the committee, would give banks a number of new underwriting powers, but it stopped short of legislation that would permit them to underwrite either mutual funds or corporate stocks. **********The bill would also place restrictions and conditions on banks entering securities underwriting. **********Bankers, calling Mr. St Germain's bill anti-competitive and anti-bank, said that while on the surface it was similar to a bill passed earlier this year by the Senate, in essence the bills represented sharply different ways of regulating banks. Bankers Prefer No Bill **********Under the St Germain bill, the bankers said, the cost of entering underwriting fields would be prohibitively expensive. These bankers said they would prefer no bill. **********Despite the opposition from bankers, aides to Mr. St Germain and banking lobbyists said they expected the bill to be approved by the House Banking Committee, possibly as soon as next week. **********The fate of the bill in the House is uncertain. If the Banking Committee passes the bill, it will go to the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose chairman, John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, is expected to press for additional restrictions on banks' participation in the securities business. Impetus Seen for Compromise **********Some lobbyists and Congressional aides suggested that the Supreme Court decision last month that upheld the right of banks to engage in some limited securities underwriting would provide impetus for a compromise bill, perhaps late in the year. **********Bankers complained today that the St Germain bill would require them to offer costly and risky consumer services, like low-cost checking accounts to the poor and elderly and government check-cashing services. They said low-cost checking accounts are practical for the nation's largest banks in urban settings but highly costly for smaller banks. **********The bankers said these programs would be subject to fraud and abuse. The bill also would preclude banks from entering such lucrative markets as the underwriting of corporate equities and mutual funds and from selling real estate. Industry Group's Opposition **********The American Bankers Assocation ''is deeply disappointed in the second committee print and will vigorously oppose it unless significant changes are made,'' said Charles Pistor, president of the American Bankers Association. He called the bill disappointing, adding, ''It is anticonsumer and anticompetitive.'' **********Under the St Germain bill, banks could immediately begin underwriting commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other debt instruments collateralized by such consumer debt as auto loans. They would also be able to sell mutual funds to the public, although they could not underwrite them. **********All these activities would have to be conducted through a subsidiary of a bank holding company; they could not be part of the bank itself. Glass-Steagall Act Upheld **********While the St Germain bill expands bank powers, it does not go so far as to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1934, which for more than 50 years has separated banking from underwriting. **********The Senate Banking Committee bill, approved overwhelmingly by the full Senate earlier this year, would repeal the key provision of Glass-Steagall and permit banks to own brokerage firms and brokerage firms to own banks. **********About the only part of the St Germain bill that is identical to the Senate bill is the agreement on the selling of insurance. Under both bills, banks would be permitted to sell insurance only in the state where they conduct their primary business and only if the state legislature permitted such activity. Bankers Complain of 'Firewalls' **********Bankers also complained that the St Germain bill erects strong ''firewalls'' that restrict transactions between a bank and its securities affiliate, as well as prohibiting a securities unit from sharing the name, logo, business location or advertising with a banking affiliate. **********The St Germain bill also prohibits Federal bank regulators from expanding the powers of banks to permit them to enter the real estate business. Bankers see such an expansion as potentially lucrative and a necessity in order for them to compete in the financial services industry. **********In another consumer provision, the bill would require a bank to give notice to regulators and to the public when it planned to shut a branch."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/business/your-money-using-psychology-to-help-finances.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; Using Psychology To Help Finances", "print_headline": "Your Money; Using Psychology To Help Finances", "body_text": " **********Psychological insight, along with sound financial planning, is often needed to straighten out many families' entangled finances. As Dr. Bernard E. Poduska, director of the Family Financial Counseling Clinic at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, put it, ''Financial problems are behavioral problems more often than they are numbers problems.'' **********A divorce, forced early retirement or death of a spouse, for example, can wreak such emotional and financial havoc that many people need professional help - whether from a planner, a therapist or both - to see what financial alternatives are available and decide on a course of action. **********But professional help is not always available or affordable. And many people with less extreme reactions to stress may be able to deal with their financial difficulties by themselves or with help from family members or friends. **********Dr. Poduska explained some principles for dealing with financial problems in a seminar on crisis counseling at the recent convention of the International Association for Financial Planning. In an interview this week, he elaborated on those priniciples and offered these suggestions to help people under stress with their financial decisions: *********** Avoid procrastination. Make a decision. Resolve the conflict between different approaches to the problem and the tendency to avoid the problem. Decide how to deal with it. The Greek word krisis means decision, and that is an opportunity to grow. Indecision brings anxiety and frustration. *********** Distance yourself from the situation. Place a buffer between yourself and the source of the stress. Dr. Poduska gave an example of a divorced man who felt he had been unjustly treated. Writing court-ordered child-support checks of $200 a month reopened old emotional wounds. The solution was to deposit several thousand dollars at a bank and arrange for monthly electronic transfers. Then the man could focus on his present life. *********** Appraise the available alternatives. ''Even if the alternatives are wild, explore them,'' Dr. Poduska said. ''The more freedom you have, the less stress you have.'' There may be alternate means of financing, or a creditor may allow more time. In one case, a woman needed root-canal work but had no money. She visited the B.Y.U. clinic, which is operated as a community service, and an arrangement was worked out for her with a dentist. He would do her dental work, and she would clean his office in the evening. *********** Take one thing at a time. *********** Delegate tasks and authority. *********** Act responsibly. Some people, feeling overwhelmed by debts, may avoid opening the mail or answering the telephone to evade their creditors, Dr. Poduska said. But avoidance behavior creates great stress. ''If you act irresponsibly, the anxiety will go up,'' he said. *********** Adjust your levels of aspiration. What would be enough for you in the way of a car, income or savings? ''We compare ourselves to others to lose,'' he said. One man made $65,000 a year but was depressed because his brother made $67,000. *********** Select substitute goals. ''People commit themselves to one path, one way of doing things,'' he said. ''A lot of this is hard to let go of.'' If the goal is a private college, for example, and money is not available, go to a public school. *********** Focus your energy on the things that matter the most to you. ''It's not needs that get people into financial problems, but their wants,'' Dr. Poduska said. ''Gaining all those things you don't need will never satisfy you.'' **********One way Dr. Poduska and his students at the B.Y.U. clinic help people in financial disarray is to set up survival budgets to cover shelter, food and clothing. ''The first questions to ask are, 'What do they want most, and can that be saved?' '' he said. ''If it can, it can relieve much of the pressure.'' For many people, the top priority may be to keep their homes. If they can keep it, the other losses do not matter so much. **********Dr. Poduska attributed many financial problems to the ''fear of intimacy in our society.'' **********''The ultimate is the feeling - we want to feel loved, loving, lovable,'' he said, but because of the fear of intimacy, ''we substitute.'' He added, ''We want others to be impressed.'' Therefore, people buy a prestige product for themselves or as a gift to win esteem. **********This behavior is exacerbated by our society, he said, with readily available credit and advertising telling people ''what we are supposed to want.'' Dr. Poduska noted that when animals were trained in a laboratory, they performed, then they got a reward. But ''credit cards are reverse conditioning,'' he said. ''People get the reward, and then they are supposed to bar-press.'' For an increasing number of people, this leads to bankruptcy. **********Dr. Poduska encouraged people to ''make a distinction between having and doing.'' He said, ''Know what you really want instead of what you are supposed to want.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/09/business/company-news-hanson-unit-sells-a-cement-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hanson Unit Sells A Cement Plant", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Hanson Unit Sells A Cement Plant", "body_text": " **********Hanson P.L.C., the British-based conglomerate, said that one of its American subsidiaries, Kaiser Cement, had agreed to sell one of its California plants for $195 million to the Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Company. **********Hanson acquired the Kaiser Cement Corporation in March 1987 for $250 million.

Yet the idea of videotex - a service that harnesses the power of the personal computer to bring electronic shopping, information and entertainment into the home - remains so compelling that the International Business Machines Corporation, the nation's largest computer maker, and Sears, Roebuck & Company, the largest retailer, have formed an alliance to try to resurrect the market once again. **********The idea is this: The personal computer, the modem and the telephone provide all the technology one needs to tap into a boundless universe of information and services. The world is at everyone's fingertips. The technology has existed for some time. Why, then, have so many videotex projects died? **********Analysts say previous efforts relied on the public's fascination with computer gadgetry, expecting that alone to provide a market. Prodigy, as the I.B.M.-Sears effort is known, has stepped away from the hardware and software and built from the other end, using extensive interviews with computer owners to see what services and features they are most interested in. ''I was incredibly impressed by the thoroughness of the way they researched,'' said Peter K. Francese, president of American Demographics Inc. of Ithaca, N.Y. ''They've let their research dictate the design of the system, rather than let the equipment dictate the design. If they fail, it can't be done by anybody.'' **********Among other things, the research showed that consumers who want to shop electronically want to do it at local stores; people who want information about movies want local listings, rather than a compilation of films nationwide that would include many not available at neighborhood theaters. **********Dennis Hayes, chief executive of Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. - who is an interested party, since Hayes has designed a special low-cost modem for use with Prodigy - predicted Prodigy would benefit from the increasing number of single-parent households and of households where both parents work. These, he said, have created a generation of extremely busy people looking for ways to better manage their time. **********The I.B.M.-Sears venture began in 1984 as Trintex, with CBS Inc. a third partner. CBS later withdrew from the project and Trintex changed its name to the Prodigy Services Company. **********The Prodigy service is now being test-marketed in Hartford, San Francisco and Atlanta, where it was demonstrated at the annual Spring Comdex computer trade show earlier this month. It will be offered to the general public in these cities in the fall. **********Theodore Papes Jr., the president and chief executive of Prodigy, said 20 cities, including New York, would have the service by the end of next year. He declined to name the other cities. Prodigy's goal is to create a nationwide network of millions of home-based subscribers in the early 1990's. **********Several dozen companies, local and national, have signed up to offer services, which range from banking and stock brokerage to travel, lodging and shopping for groceries. American Airlines, J. C. Penney, Levi Strauss, Spiegel, Procter & Gamble, Computerland, NEC Home Electronics, Kroger, Dow Jones, USA Today and, of course, I.B.M. and Sears, have already signed up. Executives should take heed, Mr. Papes said: Prodigy can provide ''marketing and advertising opportunities at the speed of light.'' Nearly 100 advertisers have already signed up, he said. **********This is how Prodigy is expected to work when the major components are in place: **********The subscriber, probably well off financially but starved for time, turns on the personal computer and logs on to the service. From the installation of the software and modem to the way the menus look on the screen, everything about Prodigy has been greatly simplified from previous videotex services. **********Choosing from a screen menu, the user shops for groceries at the local Kroger supermarket. Items are displayed in a list, aisle by aisle. The computer remembers what the shopper bought on previous electronic visits and asks if any items need to be restocked.

HAYES said he thought Prodigy has the magic formula for success. His company, the largest maker of modems for personal computers, has designed a new, compact and low-cost Personal Modem 1200 exclusively for Prodigy. The device is designed to be plugged into a regular wall socket with simple connections to the phone and the computer. (Prodigy can also work with other computers and modems.) ''Since we've been in this business we've been talking about what kinds of things have to happen to change the market for telecommunications,'' Mr. Hayes said. The key, he said, was the development of a broad base of demand outside the business world. Several factors are essential for that shift, including low-cost equipment and services that customers want. **********''PC's are now in the price range of about $500,'' he continued, ''so we started to look for the missing ingredient. Software is the motivation, and Prodigy is trying to become that. The barrier then was not having a modem, so about three years ago we started from scratch to design a new personal modem.'' **********In the first two weeks that Prodigy was offered to Hayes employees, Mr. Hayes said, more than 200 signed up. Each subscriber pays the flat $9.95 monthly fee for unlimited service.

''The era of the hostages is over.'' **********He added, however, that the release of the hostages ''is not all in Teheran's hands,'' and that the current political anarchy in Lebanon might make any hostage release more difficult. In addition, Iran wants information about the fate of four Iranians taken hostage five years ago by Lebanese Christian militiamen with ties to the West, he said. **********''The Iranians want to see the Europeans make an effort on behalf of their hostages,'' Mr. Alawi said. ''If these men are dead, then their bodies should be recovered.'' **********The issue of Iran's hostages was a key element of negotiations with Britain preceding the normalization of relations announced on Friday. **********Mr. Alawi said he shared his views with Secretary of State George P.

''But both sides have said in very clear terms that they are willing to improve relations.'' **********On the Iranian side, he added, there is a similar reluctance to begin a dialogue in the twilight of the Reagan Administration. **********Mr. Alawi's remarks are significant in light of the fact that his country is part of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council that has strongly supported Iraq in its war with Iran. Of all the Arab nations in the Persian Gulf, Oman has maintained the closest relationship with Iran throughout the war and Mr. Alawi often meets with senior Iranian officials. **********State Department officials who closely watch develoments in the Middle East said there was no concrete evidence that Iran was using its influence with radical Shiite groups believed to be holding nine American hostages in Lebanon. **********At a press briefing on Friday, Mr. Shultz said there would be no change in United States policy and reiterated three obstacles to progress in American-Iranian relations: the Iran-Iraq war, Iran's sponsorship of terrorism and what he called ''the hostage problem.'' **********But Mr. Shultz acknowledged that Iran's embrace of a cease-fire last month and its rapprochement with some Western nations were positive signs.

No other major stock market has returned to its pre-crash levels. **********Yesterday, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks closed at 26,769.22 yen, well above the previous record of 26,646.43 yen reached on Oct. 14, five days before share prices around the world collapsed. That increase was 258.05 yen, or 97-hundredths of 1 percent. In trading today the Nikkei had risen another 141.68 yen, to 26,910.90, by the close of the morning session. **********The surge in prices demonstrates the underlying strength in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest in terms of money invested. While the Tokyo market has now exceeded pre-crash levels, the New York and London markets have posted comparatively modest advances and are well below their record levels.  [ In a move to bolster investor confidence in the market, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a sharp increase in the level of capital required for specialist brokers to buy or sell stocks. Page D1. ]  High corporate profits, low interest rates, continuing economic growth, and Government actions to prevent any drastic fall in stock prices have driven the Tokyo market's rebound, analysts here said. Fears of Overheating **********Some Japanese officials, notably Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, have expressed fears that the Tokyo market could be overheating. Mr. Sumita told reporters yesterday that share prices were rising too fast in relation to the rate of economic growth. **********Other analysts point out that any panic in other stock markets might spread to Tokyo, given the degree to which markets are interconnected. **********But most analysts here said they saw no signs of imminent danger. Indeed, they said, the stock market's recent strength rests on a firmer foundation than the surge that ended last October, prompting most to predict that the market will continue to do well. **********The market's rise reflects a recognition by the Japanese of their nation's financial and industrial power, most analysts agree. Pressed by trading partners to export less, Japanese companies endured nearly two years of falling profits caused by the rise of the yen against the dollar. But now demand from within Japan, not exports, is driving Japanese economic growth. **********''There is a feeling of great confidence that Japan is now a master of its own fate economically,'' said Ron Napier, an economist for Salomon Brothers Inc. here. ''Where people used to think that they had to wait to ride the next export wave, now Japan can create its own growth.'' **********Japanese stock prices have been recovering steadily since the beginning of this year, and the breaking of the record had been widely anticipated. Security analysts here said that Wednesday's strong showing on Wall Street, when the Dow Jones industrial average rose 64 points, or 3.2 percent, helped create yesterday's surge in Tokyo. The Dow gained only a half-point yesterday. **********In Tokyo institutional investors, who have remained cautious recently, bought heavily yesterday, and trading volume soared. But analysts said there are other, more fundamental reasons for the market's strength. **********Corporate profits have rebounded sharply, by about 15 percent, since October. Japan's economy has continued to expand, with domestic demand stimulating the growth. Interest rates have remained low, making the potential for profit in the stock market seem more appealing than keeping money in bank accounts. **********Last week, the Government imposed a 20 percent tax on certain savings accounts that had been allowed to accumulate interest tax free. Depositors are expected to shop around for better investments, and some analysts have predicted their money would bolster the stock markets. But such activity was not credited with any of this week's advance. The market has benefited from the strong yen, which has made imports of raw materials less expensive, helping to hold down inflation despite rapid economic growth. Finally, the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen, despite some recent fluctuations, seems to be relatively stable. **********''Japan is in a virtuous circle,'' said Peter Tasker, general manager of research for Kleinwort Benson International, a British securities firm. ''It's very difficult for things to go wrong now, it seems.'' **********Mr. Tasker pointed out that share prices had climbed gradually and steadily, in contrast to the sharp rises of last spring and fall, when prices often jumped by 700 or 800 points. **********Still another factor is that success breeds success. Susumu Kato, chief economist here for County Natwest, a British financial institution, said that because the Tokyo market outperformed other markets, fund managers around the world felt they could not afford to stay out of Tokyo. Since mid-January, foreigners have returned to the Tokyo market in force. The Fears of October **********For months before the October collapse, some analysts had speculated that any global crash might start in Tokyo. They distrusted what appeared to be excessively high price-earnings ratios, a common way to assess a stock's underlying value. But accounting rules in Japan differ from those elsewhere, and Japanese investors tend to use other measures, such as the worth of a company's land holdings, to evaluate a stock. **********Foreigners may also have underestimated the Government's commitment to keeping share prices high. Since the crash in October, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly moved to reassure investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/15/business/company-news-ford-rebate-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Rebate Plan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford Rebate Plan", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company said it had extended its buyer incentive program, which it began in late October, for another month.

There is no longer a morning rush hour because so few people are working. At night the streets are deserted because few have extra money to spend. **********Panama's economic slide has been caused primarily by efforts to oust its leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug-trafficking and racketeering charges. Most political observers say that the economy's capacity to spring back depends on whether a lasting solution can be found that will restore faith in the Government. Doubts About a Solution **********But in interviews here, several businessmen, diplomats and political leaders said they doubt such a far-reaching solution can be found, given corruption within the army, the military-dominated ruling party and the Government and among business cronies sponsored by the army. **********As the crisis continues, business executives here are concerned that billions of dollars in private capital could be withdrawn from the country for good, and that international banks, trading companies and the educated professional class may be considering leaving as well. **********''Faith is the hardest thing to rebuild,'' an executive at a major concern here said in an interview. ''Once it is gone, you can't just bring it back, and right now people are losing faith in Panama.'' **********That gloomy conclusion has spurred a strong debate here over the value of continuing American economic sanctions that have failed to force General Noriega to resign quickly. 'Ruined a Healthy Economy' **********Some of those interviewed here argue that although they are painful, the sanctions have to be maintained to eventually force General Noriega out. Others, including some American officials, argue that the sanctions are further damaging the economy and that there is no assurance they will force General Noriega to go. **********''We have ruined a healthy capitalist economy, weakened the pro-American middle class and created the conditions in Panama for growing Communist influence,'' said an American official here. ''You've got to give yourself credit: That's a hell of an achievement for diplomacy.'' **********Five leading Panamanian economists recently published an open letter here arguing that even with a political solution, it will take at least two years to revive the economy. The economists reported that the economy is working at 40 percent of normal capacity and that 25 percent of the work force faces semi-permanent unemployment in the years ahead. Construction Halted **********The construction industry once provided jobs for 30,000 Panamanians. Today, every construction site in the capital is silent. **********Since most people in Panama have little money, few are paying rent, electricity or water bills or buying anything other than food. Most people say they are living on savings. **********Political leaders and economists say they doubt that the large international banking community here and the free trade zone in the port of Colon will fully recover from the crisis because, they say, the military regime will not change sufficiently to bring lasting confidence. **********International businesses annually generate hundreds of millions of dollars of income and jobs that help give Panamanians one of the highest standards of living in Latin America. They also contribute to a highly educated, professional middle class and a degree of social stability that are rare in the region. Banks to Try Reopening **********Banks have been closed for several weeks, but are now scheduled to try to reopen. Most economists, however, believe the banks have almost no funds to loan or to pay depositors. Since no one can get credit, businesses cannot import needed products and farmers cannot get loans to plant crops. Business executives frankly discuss the prospect of bankruptcy. **********The working-class slums of the capital, like Chorillo and San Miguelito, are full of men who once had jobs. Several businessmen said in interviews that they are paying their employees who have been laid off $20 to $50 a week so their families will have something to eat. But it is a stop-gap measure that they say cannot last. **********The Government is barely surviving by paying its employees with checks that banks will honor only for a small portion of their value. The checks are, however, accepted by some supermarkets - which allows Government employees to eat. Internal Currency **********The Government checks have, in turn, become a kind of internal currency, because the Government will accept them as cash for the payment of tax and utility bills. **********Business operators say there is a black market in the checks. Government employees sell them for lower than face value to get dollars in return. The buyer can then use the check for its full value to pay debts to the Government. The American dollar, known here as the balboa, is the local currency. **********The Government is heading for bankruptcy because it is receiving almost no funds to back the checks that it is circulating. **********Most economists think the Government is already bankrupt. Two leading bankers say the Government's central bank has an estimated $115 million in bad loans to Government agencies. Reportedly Appealed to Libya **********General Noriega has reportedly sought cash from Libya to bolster his regime, and a diplomat here said there are unconfirmed reports that the general has also sought cash assistance from the so-called Medellin drug cartel in Colombia. **********The Panamanian Chamber of Commerce held its first meeting in several months here on Thursday night. The organization has been a principal source of opposition to General Noriega, and the discussion was emotional. **********A real estate broker rose to argue that maybe the time had come to ask the United States to lift economic sanctions. The Chamber of Commerce has strongly backed the sanctions as a way to oust General Noriega. 'Safeguard of Democracy' **********Many heads began shaking in disagreement, but there was respectful applause when the real estate agent sat down after saying, ''The economic sanctions are destroying the private sector, which is the safeguard of democracy in Panama.'' **********Several business executives said after the meeting that any solution to the current crisis would require between $300 million and $500 million in assistance from the United States to revive the economy. **********One executive characterized the amount as ''the going rate'' for ousting a military dictator these days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/01/business/no-decision-by-robins.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Decision By Robins", "print_headline": "No Decision By Robins", "body_text": " **********The board of the A.

She urged them to enter anti-British neighborhoods in Belfast and appeal for the surrender of the I.R.A. gunmen who shot and killed two British soldiers Saturday. **********Expressions of outrage over those killings, which occurred after the soldiers somehow blundered at high speed into the cortege of a second I.R.A. funeral, continued in Parliament.

Some reports suggested that the issue would be considered later. Joint Statement **********The agreement was announced in a joint statement after Foreign Minister Berhanu Bahiy of Ethiopia and Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Mohamud Farah of Somalia held peace talks over the weekend in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Ethiopia's leader, Mengistu Haile Mariam, and the Somali President, Mohammed Siad Barre, first held a cautious dialogue in Djibouti in 1986 in an effort to end the virtual state of war, which had existed for nearly a decade. They agreed at the time to form a ministerial committee to search for a peaceful solution. **********Several committee meetings ended inconclusively because of disagreements over how to approach the border dispute. When the meetings began a year ago, Ethiopia said progress could be made if Somalia recognized the existing frontiers, which were guaranteed during colonial times and confirmed by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. **********Ethiopia initially suggested that the two sides discuss only the border issue. But Somalia's position was that the two countries should agree on steps to disengage their forces, resume diplomatic relations and exchange prisoners before moving on to the more difficult question of setting the frontier. Ethiopia later indicated that it had accepted the Somali proposal. Expanse of Scrubland **********Since it gained independence in 1960, Somalia had laid claim to the Ogaden, an arid expanse of scrubland in eastern Ethiopia that is populated mainly by ethnic Somali nomads. Somalia had long maintained that the people of the Ogaden should have the right to decide between Ethiopian control or annexation by Somalia. The two countries went to war in 1977, leading to a realignment of influence in the Horn of Africa between the United States and the Soviet Union. **********Somali forces backed by Moscow invaded the disputed territory. A year later, after a sharp advance, the Somalis were beaten back by the Ethiopians, who were supported by Cuban troops and freshly armed by the Soviet Union, which had switched sides after Washington refused to resupply and re-equip Ethiopia. The Government in Addis Ababa had been a strong ally of the West before Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974 by left-leaning military officers. After Moscow switched sides and backed Ethiopia, Somalia broke with the Russians and turned to Washington as its main ally."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/17/business/company-news-metromedia-orion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Metromedia-Orion", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Metromedia-Orion", "body_text": " **********John W.

It is a place of farms and fruit stalls, but on the hillsides back from the road stand the sentinels of a harsher world - the towers of concrete and steel atop South Africa's richest gold field. **********It was here in mines that underpin the economy of this racially divided nation that the National Union of Mineworkers, a black union formed in 1982, mounted a 21-day strike last August. Although the walkout was resolved relatively quickly, it was the most costly strike ever sustained by the economy and left a residue of distrust - as well as uncertainty about the future of South Africa's mainstay industry and the country's largest company, the Anglo American Corporation. **********The stoppage ended with six strikers dead and hundreds injured and it cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production and physical damage. It also raised questions about the ability of Anglo American and the other major mining companies involved to handle increasing militancy among black workers who constitute more than 85 percent of the total work force. **********Six months after the 1987 walkout, key mines are still struggling to regain pre-strike production levels. Although share values have at least partly recovered from the dismal levels of the strike, the continuing ill-feeling suggests to many that the industry may be heading into years of protracted strife that will further destablize the South African economy. Far from forging a common resolve to avoid future confrontations, the strike seems to have hardened attitudes all around - within the Government, the mining companies and not least among the miners. **********The union's leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said the stoppage was only a ''dress rehearsal'' for future strikes, the first of which could come later this year when the one-year contract that emerged from the 1987 strike expires. Mr. Ramaphosa, who is closely associated with the outlawed African National Congress, leader of the political resistance among blacks, has vowed that there will be no end to confrontation on the mines until whites abandon the system of apartheid. **********For its part the Government has reacted by proposing changes in the labor laws that would make legal strikes more difficult to call and impose crippling financial penalties on those calling illegal stoppages. A broader crackdown last month sought to stunt black labor power still further by banning all political activity by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the organization that has coordinated the growing challenge that blacks have been posing through strikes. **********The miners' union, the congress's most important affiliate, has not been banned. But at the Chamber of Mines, the industry group that represents the major mining companies in negotiations, the strike has stiffened doubts that many companies had long harbored about the wisdom of allowing black unions. And perhaps most significant, the walkout has fostered a new toughness at the Anglo American Corporation, employer of 40 percent of the 650,000 black mineworkers in South Africa. The company has long staked out a position as the conscience of the industry on matters involving blacks. **********At Anglo, as it is widely known, executives have for years fostered an image of corporate harmony, one suited to the genteel traditions of the Oppenheimer family that has guided the corporation from its beginnings in 1917 to its stature today as the colossus of the South African economy, with more than 600 corporate subsidiaries, 800,000 employees and profits last year of more than $600 million. But the quiet confidence at 44 Main Street in Johannesburg, the company's granite-block headquarters, was badly shaken by the internal strife that the stoppage set off. **********Among the corporation's top executives there is a powerful group associated with Gavin F. Relly, the company's chairman, that has little trouble with the idea that the corporation will have to be more rigorous in protecting its interests. But this group has had to contend with other executives who are loath to compromise on the record built under Harry F. Oppenheimer, the former chairman, as one of the most progressive employers in South Africa on issues of pay and rights for blacks. **********The divisiveness at Anglo is symptomatic of the wider crisis facing white moderates. In the 1980's, and increasingly so in the past two or three years, the struggle over the country's future has come down to a test of strength between the intractable conservatives who control the Government and black militants resolved to use every means, including labor power, to advance black rule. In the process the middle ground held by people like Mr. Oppenheimer has been shrinking. **********In the case of the gold mining industry, the implications are ominous. Throughout the 1980's the industry has been producing about 670 tons of gold a year, 55 percent of production of the non-Communist world. At a price of $440 an ounce this is worth more than $10.5-billion a year, nearly half of South Africa's total exports. About 50 percent of these revenues end up in the Government treasury, which has led some black militants to charge that apartheid is a system built on gold.  The History of the Reef **********From the moment that blacks began organizing for relief from racial oppression at the turn of the century, the mines were destined to play an important role. Gold was found in the Johannesburg area in the 1880's. Discoveries continued to be made for the next 60 years along the Reef, the name given to the area by the 19th century miners who discovered the rich vein of gold along a 200-mile axis running from the Johannesburg region toward the southwest. The last major gold strike, in the northern reaches of the Orange Free State, was made in the 1940's. **********The first attempt to organize black miners came in 1941 with the establishment of the African Mineworkers' Union. A strike was called in 1946 after the union's demands for a basic wage of 10 shillings a day were rebuffed. Production was halted or seriously interrupted at a dozen gold mines. But the stoppage collapsed within a week, crushed by police intervention and the arrest of many union leaders. That union never functioned effectively again. **********However, lessons had been learned, among them the enthusiasm that miners had shown for the union and the sensitivity of the Government toward anything that threatened the smooth functioning of the mines. They were lessons not lost on blacks in 1979. At the time, the Government was seeking a less repressive image in the wake of the 1976 riots in Soweto, a black satellite city outside Johannesburg, and accepted the recommendations of a commission that urged the extension to black unions of the labor rights traditionally enjoyed by whites. **********When Mr. Ramaphosa began organizing the National Union of Miners in 1982 it was natural that his efforts should focus on Anglo American. Although Mr. Oppenheimer, now nearly 80 years old, retired as chairman the year the union was established, he had argued insistently during the 1970's for the right of black unions to be established under law. It was a stand that at the time was far from universally popular in industry. **********The executive did not pretend that his purposes were solely altruistic: A failure to transfer ''the benefits of a free enterprise society'' to blacks, he argued, would push them toward radical political solutions. Mr. Oppenheimer has backed his convictions with hundreds of millions of dollars in support for improvements in black housing, education and medical care, as well as in bankrolling the white political grouping that has fought for moderation in Parliament, the Progressive Federal Party. **********Perhaps the most significant contribution the company made was to encourage, or at least not to seriously hinder, the union's recruiting efforts in Anglo American mines in the 1980's. While membership lagged at other mining concerns, the union counted 60 percent of its 245,000 members among Anglo American employees by 1987. When the strike hit Anglo American harder than any other company - two-thirds of the 44 gold and coal mines that closed belonged to Anglo American or to companies in which it held a majority stake - it was scarcely surprising that the company's executives should feel that their tolerance toward the union had been ill-rewarded.  The Views at One Mine **********A visitor to the Western Deep Levels mine, whose 23,000 black workers make it one of Anglo American's largest, senses how distant a resolution of the tensions between the company and the union is likely to be. Resentments generated by the strike continue to smoulder, so much so that white managers worry that years of efforts to foster an improving morale have been lost. **********Inside the mine near the town of Carletonville, 50 miles southwest of Johannesburg, a visitor finds ample evidence of the effort to improve the miners' well-being. Newly renovated dormitories, sports facilities and a new town where miners with families are being encouraged to buy company-subsidized homes give concrete expression to Mr. Oppenheimer's vision of black employees as beneficiaries, not victims, of the system. **********But among Anglo officials in day-to-day contact with the miners, there is little optimism that the effort can assuage the deeper passions unleashed by the strike. **********Frederick J. Bayley, general manager of the Anglo American subsidiary that controls Western Deep Levels and a neighboring mine, believes that the mining companies have no alternative but to continue to accept unionization. But he is also convinced that this will make the mines a hostage to the country's political tensions. **********''Put yourself in the shoes of the A.N.C. leadership,'' he said. ''You're not going to fight an open war. The obvious answer is to go for the heart of the country's economy, and where better to focus than the gold mines?'' **********When the strike began, senior executives in Johannesburg were confident that the union could not sustain it for more than 72 hours. It was a bad mistake, since it quickly became obvious that a stoppage that lasted longer than a few days was going to cause major damage to deep-level workings at the mines. Under the gigantic pressures of the rock overhang, tunnels and minefaces at 6,000 feet and deeper began compressing steel and wood supports, closing some stopes that are normally three feet in depth to half that and less. **********Within a week, Mr. Bayley and his colleagues at other mines were reporting to Johannesburg that prompt action had to be taken if the mines were not to be damaged beyond repair. It was then that the company decided to issue a 48-hour ultimatum to workers involved in deep-level operations to resume their shifts or be dismissed. After a false start at Western Deep Levels, where 3,000 men went underground and promptly began a sit-in, the ultimatum was extended. Ultimately 45,000 men were fired by Anglo, nearly one of every four working in the company's gold mines. **********Six months later much of the work at Western Deep Levels is dedicated to re-opening areas that suffered serious rock convergence, and managers do not expect to have production back to pre-strike levels before next month. The company declines to put a price on the recovery operations, but according to the company's quarterly report, production losses caused by the strike ran to more than $50 million. Mr. Bayley, for one, concludes that another strike cannot be tolerated. ''If you have another extended strike in a place like this, you're going to risk losing your mine,'' he said. **********Among the miners, the consequences are of another kind. Sullen silences are common when visitors descend into the mine and inquire about the strike. **********A miner in a dormitory, wearing a union sweatshirt showing a miner raising a clenched fist, said that white supervisors had gone out of their way to victimize workers who joined the strike. **********''People are fearing for their lives,'' he said. ''The shift bosses, when they speak to you, they say, 'Now, see how things are. The union is finished, nobody's going to help you now.' ''  The Outlook in Johannesburg **********At Anglo headquarters, executives say they are resolved never to allow strike action to damage the company as badly again. In the next contract, they said, they will seek a no-strike agreement for the deep-level mines, or the inclusion of miners responsible for working the deepest shafts among those workers classified as essential and thus exempt from strike action. And as a manifest of the company's new resolve, spokesmen say they have no reason to regret their actions during the strike, including the dismissals and the use of force to recover control of the mine dormitories. **********Robert M. Godsell, the company's principal consultant on labor problems, acknowledged that the crackdown had prompted tense internal debates. But he said that once the actions had been taken, a consensus emerged. ''If the Ford Motor Company was to sustain a strike for 12 months, 24 months or whatever - long enough, in any event, to threaten the company's survival - there would come a point when they would seek to resume production by whatever means they had available,'' he said. **********In a bid to mend fences with the union, the corporation agreed after the strike to a three-month period in which dismissed strikers would be considered first as the company began re-hiring for the mines. By last month, more than 30,000 fired Anglo miners had been taken on again. In a further effort to placate the union, the corporation has agreed to place the whole issue of the dismissals in arbitration before a Johannesburg attorney specializing in labor law, William Schreiner. **********At the same time, the corporation has warned the union to adopt a less militant stance. If Mr. Ramaphosa attempts to use his power in the mines to advance a militant political agenda, Mr. Godsell said, he will end up compromising the material gains that can be won for his members, and invite a backlash from the Government. **********The Government's own warning was implicit in its decision to ban the umbrella labor group along with 17 other anti-apartheid groups that were listed in its crackdown last month; officials have implied that the miner's union and other black labor groups that continue to agitate for black rule will be banned if they continue to press ''revolutionary'' goals. But there has been no sign that the warnings have inhibited Mr. Ramaphosa. **********The militancy is palpable at the union's headquarters in a busy commercial section of downtown Johannesburg, where an array of political posters includes a copy of the A.N.C.'s Freedom Charter, adopted last year as the union's own credo. The charter pledges the nationalization of the mines. ''The mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the people as a whole,'' it says. **********Every day, hundreds of dismissed miners mill around the office, filling out depositions to be used in the union's arbitration hearings that begin later this month. Amid the activity, Mr. Ramaphosa's deputy, Marcel Golding, 27 years old, sat for a brief interview and dismissed suggestions that the union should stick to ''bread-and-butter'' issues. Virtually everything about the mining industry, he said, was tied up with apartheid. ''The fact is that apartheid has suited the interests of capital in this country very well,'' he said. **********More than anything, Mr. Golding said, the proof of the identity of interest between the Afrikaners who devised the apartheid system and ''mine bosses'' like Mr. Oppenheimer was their failure, despite years of promises, to pay black miners a decent wage. According to Anglo American's calculations, the average pay in the company's gold mines after last year's strike was 500 South African rand, equivalent to $255 dollars a month. **********But the union offers calculations of its own that put the average wage at ''below 300 rand'' a month, $153, and the average monthly wage of whites on the mines at 1,500 rand, $765. **********''The vast majority of the workers at the mineface - and they are the largest group on the mines - are earning between 280 rand and 300 rand a month,'' Mr. Golding said. ''And by every measure you want to use, that's below the poverty line. So what you have here is a company that promises the benefits of free enterprise, and keeps them all for the whites.'' **********In a few months, the confrontation will be resumed as negotiations begin on a new 12-month contract. Early maneuvering suggests that Mr. Ramaphosa will again be bidding for a wage increase that would give the miners an increase in income beyond South Africa's inflation rate, currently running at close to 17 percent. At Anglo American, still counting the losses from last year's strike, executives have made it plain that they will fight anything that imposes a drag on earnings. **********For the union and the Chamber of Mines, it may be difficult to avoid another strike. But whatever becomes of the talks in 1988, the industry seems set for a long period of turmoil, with no end in view until the country reaches a broad accommodation on the matters that divide whites and blacks. How long that will be is anybody's guess, but there are few on either side of the confrontation who see a resolution at any time soon.

Mr. Emerson writes that as part of the operation, agents from the covert Army unit, code-named Yellow Fruit, were to to set up covert airstrips in Costa Rica. **********Yellow Fruit was later disbanded after its members were court-martialed for financial improprieties, Two years later, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, who was subsequently dismissed as a National Security Council aide, used money from arms sales to Iran to underwrite the contra resupply operation and construction of an airstrip in Costa Rica. The C.I.A. has repeatedly denied knowing anything of this effort and the Congressional Iran-contra committees investigated the incident and were unable to find corroboration. Other New Assertions **********The book, excerpts of which are appearing this week's edition of U.S. News and World Report, makes these other new assertions with regard to Colonel North's operations and the Pentagon units: *********** Colonel North's notebooks show that his efforts to free Americans kidnapped in Lebanon included direct and indirect contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Libyans, and even Abu Nidal, the terrorist who Colonel North testified had threatened his life. According to the book, Colonel North was told that an intermediary representing the Americans had met with Walid Yousef, a representative of Abu Nidal, on Aug. 5 and Aug. 6, 1986. *********** By November 1985, American intelligence had pinpointed the location of five of the six hostages in Lebanon. They were said to be in the Sheik Abdullah barracks in the Baalbek region of Lebanon, which is under Syrian control. The American Ambassador to Syria, William Eagleton, told the Syrians they would get full credit if the hostages were freed, but nothing happened. *********** One of the Army units put eavesdropping devices in the home of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman. Some Army intelligence officials feared that General Noriega was obtaining highly classified information from United States military intelligence operations in Central America. A bug was placed in General Noriega's conference room in an apartment complex used by him in Panama City, the book said, but little information was obtained. *********** A classified C.I.A. document drafted in May 1984, said the agency ''has reason to believe'' that a company headed by one of the key intermediaries in the Iran dealings ''may be associated with Iranian terrorist-supported activities being run out of official Iranian installations in Vienna and Barcelona.'' The head of the company, Albert Hakim, later was a key operative in the contra resupply network and helped arrange diplomatic contacts with Iran. His lawyer, Richard Janis, did not return a phone call requesting comment. **********In some cases, assertions in the book are supported by Government documents obtained by Mr. Emerson. Other evidence was said to have been drawn from interviews with military personnel involved in some of the activities described in the book and from previously unreleased portions of Colonel North's notebook. **********The book describes how the military moved to improve its abilities for covert operations and intelligence-gathering after the mission to rescue American hostages in Iran failed in 1980. The units became involved in a wide range of activities, sometimes in cooperation with the C.I.A. and at other times in competition with it, the book says. **********In Central America, one of the units reportedly carried out an operation in which Army aircraft owned by front companies were used to intercept communications by Salvadoran guerrillas and the Nicaraguan military. Operations 'Ripe' for Abuse **********The book also details how the creation of the special units was cloaked in secrecy and kept from key military officers. **********''The genesis of Yellow Fruit was purposely poorly documented,'' Theodore Greenberg, the Federal prosecutor who looked into Yellow Fruit, wrote in a classified document obtained by Mr. Emerson. ''The inattention to command authority and responsibility in the Office of Special Operations created an atmosphere which was ripe for the abuse of regulations and unlawful activities which were carried on. If these abuses and unlawful activities were not discovered at a relatively early stage, the damage would have been inestimable.'' **********The operations against General Noriega took place in 1982, the book says. At the time, senior Army intelligence officials suspected that a female intelligence agent assigned to cultivate General Noriega had developed ''too close a relationship to the Panamaian leader,'' the book says. American officials reportedly also feared that General Noriega was getting information from a Guatemalan Government official who was having an affair with an American intelligence official stationed in Panama. **********An Army investigation later concluded that the operation to bug General Noriega's residence had not been approved by the intelligence officials who are required to review such operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/26/business/taiwan-and-south-korea-stress-trade-cooperation-efforts.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1988-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 481, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taiwan and South Korea Stress Trade Cooperation Efforts", "print_headline": "Taiwan and South Korea Stress Trade Cooperation Efforts", "body_text": " **********Taiwan and South Korea, responding to Administration accusations of currency manipulation, said today that they had been given insufficient credit for their efforts to cooperate. **********''We have different views and different opinions,'' Eui-yong Chung, an economic counselor at the Korean embassy, said of the American criticism. A spokesman for Taiwan, Albert Lin, said the validity of the charges is a ''matter of opinion.'' But neither country specifically refuted the accusations. **********In a report to Congress that was required by the trade law signed by the President in August, the Treasury said the countries realized immense success in trade with the United States, selling far more in goods in this country than they buy, by artificially linking their currencies to the dollar and imposing barriers against imports of American goods. The Treasury said it would soon begin negotiations to try to halt the practices. **********The linkage, in which the currencies of these two countries are managed to maintain their industries' edge in competition with the United States, is ''designed to prevent their exchange rates from reflecting market forces and to achieve a competitive advantage,'' the report said.

The debt is falling sharply as the country's economy and trade improve and could disappear in a year or two, but for the moment, Mr. Chung said, Korea needs a trade surplus to obtain the funds to make payments on the debt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/08/business/new-yorkers-co-bold-on-charity-bashful-on-publicity.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1988-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Yorkers & Co.; Bold on Charity, Bashful on Publicity", "print_headline": "New Yorkers & Co.; Bold on Charity, Bashful on Publicity", "body_text": " **********When his name surfaced last month in connection with a Congressional appropriation of $8 million to build schools in France for refugees from North Africa, Zev W. Wolfson was appalled. **********Not that he was embarrassed that he was one of several members of the group, Ozar Hatorah, that lobbied for the money. Mr. Wolfson, a wealthy 58-year-old real estate investor, has contributed to the organization for years to support the education of Sephardic Jews who fled persecution and hunger in North Africa. **********Nor was he shy about having donated in 1985 what he has described as a token $1,000 to the re-election campaign of an old friend, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and the sponsor of the appropriation measure. It was his first and only contribution to Mr. Inouye in their more than 15 years of acquaintance, and the Senator said last week in a speech asking Congress to rescind the appropriation that he did not even know about the gift until after the measure had been signed into law. **********It is just that Mr. Wolfson, a native of Poland who emigrated to the United States in 1948, does not relish the personal attention. He does not put his name on his buildings in the style of Donald J. Trump or Harry Helmsley. He has not hired a publicity agent to bring the press to his doorstep, as many younger developers have. And he does not allow his name to be used to identify the many gifts he makes to charitable organizations. **********''The highest order of giving is to give anonymously,'' he often tells friends and associates, quoting Maimonides, a Jewish philosopher. **********For Mr. Wolfson, the Inouye experience represents only a temporary distraction. As he has grown older and wealthier, giving has come to occupy at least as much of his attention as his business dealings. **********''He seems to be driven to make money so that he can give it away,'' said a mortgage broker who has helped arrange financing on projects in which Mr. Wolfson is a partner. ''At the end of a deal, he tells you he plans to contribute some of his profits to charity, and he wants to know if you intend to do the same.'' **********The message is clear: Anyone who fails to ante up may well find himself left out of the deal-making the next time around. **********''He doesn't care who you contribute to, as long as some of your profits go to the needy,'' the broker said. Mr. Wolfson tends to favor organizations that provide education for poor people and charities in Israel. Others Who Give **********This linking of business and charity is shared by others in the real estate business, among them the Reichmann family, owners of Olympia and York; Edmond J. Safra, the principal stockholder of the Republic National Bank, and George Klein, whose family made its fortune in Barton's Candy and who now controls the Park Tower Realty Corporation, a Manhattan development company. **********Mr. Wolfson came into his fortune by riding the steadily rising tide of real estate values in New York in the decades that followed World War II, avoiding the most serious dips in the market and catching the crests. **********He started in the late 1950's, concentrating on a single block of the financial district, a site on the tip of Manhattan where State Street meets Water Street to form Peter Minuit Plaza. **********On behalf of a partnership that he managed, he first bought one small building on the block, then another. It took him until the end of the bull market of the 1960's to acquire enough land for an office tower. The State Street Project **********In 1969 he began construction of 1 State Street Plaza, at 32 stories. It was one of five boxes of black glass that by late 1970 had drawn a curtain of contemporary architecture around the lower end of Manhattan. For his own quarters he took a corner office near the top of the building, where he could view the harbor. **********By the time the next recession arrived in 1974, Mr. Wolfson had filled his building. He sat through the city's fiscal crisis with a full roster of tenants on long-term leases while the vacancy rate in the financial district soared. **********Having watched companies flee the neighborhood, he began to sense signs of a recovery by 1978. As the pace quickened, Mr. Wolfson decided the time had come to buy another building. He found one just up the street, at 25 Broadway - a stone edifice built in 1921 as the headquarters of the Cunard Steamship Company and now the offices of the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********A partnership he organized paid a little more than $16 million for the property, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate consulting company. He had spent several times that to build 1 State Street Plaza nine years earlier. Looking Smarter Every Year **********Rents under new leases in the Wall Street area began to rise almost immediately. By last year, Mr. Wolfson and his partners were taking in annual rents that more than equaled the original purchase price. **********Six months ago, the two buildings might have carried a market value of more than $250 million, according to industry analysts, but the sudden contraction of the financial services industry has popped the bubble of the real estate boom, and they may be worth only $200 million in today's market, said an analyst at the Edward S. Gordon Company, a real estate brokerage concern. **********After the purchase of 25 Broadway, years passed before Mr. Wolfson entered another major business deal. When city officials announced in 1984 that they would sell the development rights above the Staten Island Ferry terminal at the foot of Whitehall Street, Mr. Wolfson realized that whatever was built would obscure his view of the harbor. A Can't-Lose Situation **********He qualified as a bidder for the site, thereby reserving his right to submit a proposal for what could become a $400 million hotel-office-recreation complex. Later he sold his ticket on the bidding train to another group of developers. When their proposal won the designation to build on the site, Mr. Wolfson found himself holding a 3 percent share of the deal, according to city records. **********If the South Ferry tower became a reality, Mr. Wolfson could receive hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for decades, all for having qualified as a bidder before a deadline that most other developers missed. On the other hand, if the project were to run into trouble from, say, a declining market in the financial district - as it has - he had nothing at stake. **********His only other real estate venture involves a small portion of a hotel project under way just north of Times Square in which he is a passive investor. He has switched most of his attention to financial ventures, such as the takeover of Revere Copper and Brass Inc. last year by a partnership of which he is a member."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/25/world/at-home-with-a-very-orthodox-israeli-family.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1988-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Home, With a Very Orthodox Israeli Family", "print_headline": "At Home, With a Very Orthodox Israeli Family", "body_text": " **********When tens of thousands of Israelis petition, protest and complain about the suddenly powerful influence of rigorously Orthodox Jews on political and social life, they are talking about people like Philip and Miriam Marcus. **********Mr. Marcus says none of it surprises him. After all, to many Israelis, religious Jews - or ''black hats,'' as they are called, because of the jet-black clothing many wear - have been pariahs for as long as the state has existed. **********''There are always remarks,'' he said. ''If you step on somebody's foot, it's not because you stepped on his foot. It's because you're a black hat.'' But Mr. Marcus is understanding. Sure, it is unpleasant to be the subject of mass social protest, as the Orthodox are in Israel today. More than 20,000 people held a rally in Tel Aviv this month asking their leaders to exclude the Orthodox from the next government. Several thousand more protested in front of the Parliament on its opening day Monday with the same demand. 'Attitudes Will Change' **********But if most Israelis are unsympathetic, or in some cases even hateful, it is only because they do not understand, Mr. Marcus says. **********The Marcuses, who are immigrants from Britain, live a purely Orthodox life. He wears a skullcap, as do his children. Their kitchen is rigorously kosher. On the Sabbath, sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, no one in the Marcus household watches television or turns lights on or off. **********Speaking of the other Israelis, Mr. Marcus said: ''These people just haven't been exposed to the positive aspects of living life by the Torah. By a process of education, by learning the value of the Torah life, the attitudes will change.'' **********In the meantime, the Orthodox ''should attack the reasons for the uproar,'' he said. ''I think there's a certain amount of disinformation being spread.'' The Families Are Large **********Mr. Marcus is a 38-year-old lawyer. His wife, who is 35, teaches school and gives childbirth-preparation classes. That is a course in great demand where the Marcuses live, Har Nof, a new neighborhood in western Jerusalem where almost everyone on the street is ''black'' and many families have 10 or more children. **********The Marcuses have six children, aged from 4 to 13. **********Without hesitation, the Marcuses acknowledge that all their friends are Orthodox. But strictly observant Jews here and other Israelis do share at least one common interest these days: preoccupation with the Orthodox Jews' role as kingmakers in Israeli politics. **********''We spent all Friday night talking about it with friends,'' Mrs. Marcus said. **********Mr. Marcus says he voted for one of the parties of the religious right -Shas, Agudat Israel or Degel HaTorah - that won 13 seats in Parliament in the elections Nov. 1. He will not say which one. Army Service Is Big Issue **********All three made demands of both Labor and Likud as conditions for joining the next government. Likud has apparently met the demands, although no formal agreement has been reached. **********The majority of Israelis, by far, are nonobservant Jews, and they continue to protest the religious parties' demands. Mr. Marcus said he and his friends were ''looking at each issue, analyzing it.'' **********In their neighborhood, the Marcuses say, the question of whether religious school students should continue to be given army service deferments is of the greatest concern. Some 20,000 yeshiva students are exempt from service in the army, while virtually every other young person in the country must serve. **********It is of no small interest to the Marcuses; all six of their children are boys. Abuses Are Acknowledged **********This week 35 senior reserve and active-duty army officers sent a petition to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saying, ''We're worried about the ethical, educational and moral implications of having ministers and deputy ministers active in the government who are against the service and devotion to the defense of the state of Israel.'' **********Mr. Marcus served in the army and says his boys probably will, too. Unlike many people in his neighborhood, he thinks the Orthodox take advantage of the deferment. **********''My personal opinion is that it's proper for a small number of people, but in some cases it is abused,'' he said. ''Maybe for some students they could combine Torah studies with the army.'' **********But on some other issues he is not so accommodating. Of the so-called ''who is a Jew'' amendment, which is causing an upheaval among American Jews, Mr. Marcus said, ''There is unanimity that this is an amendment that should be passed. Impact on Converts **********The amendment would specify that people converted in the Reform or Conservative branches of Judaism, rather than under the guidance of Orthodox rabbis, would not be eligible for automatic citizenship. **********Fewer than a dozen Reform or Conservative converts ask for Israelis citizenship each year. So why is this so important? **********''The survival of the Jewish people is at stake,'' Mr. Marcus said as his wife nodded. ''The fraud being perpetrated by Reform and Conservative rabbis is only now coming to light. It has been sold to these people, the converts, that they are really holy Jews, and they are not.'' **********He continued: ''This is a Jewish state. The definition of Judiasm was set down ages ago by the Halakha. We can't let it disappear.'' He Understands the Americans **********More than 90 percent of America's 5.8 million Jews, the world's largest Jewish population, are believed to be Reform, Conservative or without any religious affiliation. And Mr. Marcus is not disparaging of those who belong to other branches of Judaism. He says he is understanding. **********''These people are Jews like anyone else,'' he said. ''But they have not been exposed to Torah Judaism. Reform and Conservative Judaism pick and choose. It's better than nothing. But Torah Judiasm leaves nothing uncovered.'' **********Even as Mr. Marcus's political party flexes its muscles and demands recognition for the interests of its constituents, Mr. Shamir is working hard to form a new coalition government with Labor, to exclude the religious parties from the next government. Some in Mr. Shamir's office say the Orthodox have not learned the limits of power, and Mr. Marcus is inclined to agree. **********''Maybe they bungled it,'' he said. ''Maybe they messed up. They're new at this. But that's part of the democratic process. People have to learn. Maybe next time we'll know.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/15/business/airbus-charges-us-aids-rivals.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airbus Charges U.S. Aids Rivals", "print_headline": "Airbus Charges U.S. Aids Rivals", "body_text": " **********Europe's Airbus consortium has begun a counteroffensive against United States charges that it is unfairly subsidized and is asserting that rival American aircraft makers get billions from Washington. **********Industry sources said today that, in a document sent to the United States and European governments, Airbus Industrie said the Seattle-based Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis had received more than $23 billion in subsidy-type support in the last 10 years. **********The Airbus document, which took more than two years to research, asserts that, without those subsidies, neither company would have made a profit and that both might have gone out of business, the industry sources said.

They were accompanied by a 12.3 percent drop in the party's standing from the previous election, to 63.2 percent of the popular vote. **********This time, Western diplomats in Singapore are guessing that the 141 opposition candidates, representing seven parties and including four independents, may take five to 10 seats.

Government, which is good,'' he said. ''But there is also that itch to say, 'Let's put in a few sticks of chili and we get a quicker response from the Government.' '' **********Western diplomats see the growth of this opposition as a natural result of the prosperity Mr. Lee has brought to Singapore, much as economic development led to increases in political freedom and openness in South Korea and Taiwan. **********But in Singapore, Mr. Lee has bucked that trend, trying to assert control over the local and foreign press and moving to intimidate the opposition with arrests, financial investigations and the redrawing of electoral districts. **********These moves themselves have given the opposition its issues, although even Mr. Lee's strongest critics acknowledge his achievement in developing the island nation of 2.7 million people into an economic showcase. **********Voting is mandatory for the electorate of 1.7 million, who will make their decision at a time when the economy is booming, wages are high, inflation is low and unemployment hardly exists. **********Growth in Singapore's gross domestic product this year is expected to exceed 9 percent, compared to 8.8 percent last year.

'Very Good Chance of Survival' **********''I think an 11-to-9 vote would have been a weak action by the committee,'' said Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat from Connecticut, who kept his colleagues bargaining for almost two days to secure certain restrictions on the sale of insurance products by banks. ''But the 18-to-2 vote we got means that the bill has a very good chance of survival in the full Senate. It also puts more pressure on the House to move.'' **********Lobbyists and Senators today predicted that the biggest battle still lies in the House, where the chairmen of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Banking Committee have not shown enthusiasm for giving banks new securities underwriting powers nor for breaking down the barriers between the banking and securities industries established by Glass-Steagall. **********Some lobbyists even predicted that the House might not pass a bill at all in a legislative year shortened by the political campaigns. Insurance Agents Opposed **********Moreover, they noted that the brokerage industry in particular was certain to fight the Proxmire bill in the House. Insurance agents, who fought the banking industry to a standoff in the Dodd compromise, also plan to lobby the House heavily. **********Under the Senate bill, banks would have the immediate authority to underwrite commerical paper, municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer debt. Six months after passage, banks would be able to underwrite corporate debt issues and mutual funds. **********But the underwriting of corporate equities - considered perhaps the most profitable underwriting area -would not automatically be authorized. The compromise requires that Congress vote on giving banks that authority in April 1991. Granting of that approval would also entail giving brokerage firms authority to own and operate banks. To get his bill approved in his committee, Mr. Proxmire had to strike key compromises with two prominent Democratic members: Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat from Michigan, and Senator Dodd. October Collapse Cited **********Mr. Riegle was pushing hard for fewer underwriting powers for the banks, arguing that in the light of the October market crash, Congress needed to proceed with caution before letting bankers enter the volatile world of underwriting. Mr. Dodd, whose state is home to many large insurance companies, insisted that some restraints be placed on banks' sales of insurance products. **********The compromise with Mr. Riegle came relatively quickly on Tuesday, but most of the day and all of Wednesday was taken up with negotiations on the insurance issues. **********The final agreement prohibits banks and their holding companies from selling insurance outside their home states. **********Members of Congress particularly fear the lobbying force of the hundreds of thousands of independent insurance agents. ''If we can help it, we don't want to hit a beehive with a baseball bat here and send the insurance agents swarming all over the Senate,'' one Senate staffer said. **********In the House, John D. Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Fernand J. St Germain of the Banking Committee are likely to give the Proxmire bill some problems. 'Far More Skeptical' **********''The House committees will be far more skeptical about any bill which grants new powers to banks without significant structural or regulatory reform,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn and a close St Germain ally. **********Mr. St Germain is likely to want to restrict banks to only a few underwriting powers, such as commerical paper, municipal revevue bonds and mortage-backed securities, and strongly oppose any bank underwriting of corporate debt, equities and mutual funds. **********Mr. Dingell also might take the approach that restricted powers are more prudent. But some in Congress feel that Mr. Dingell, whose committee has jurisdiction over the nation's securities laws, has been softening in his position somewhat. Regarding Glass-Steagall, Senator Dodd said, ''I've been told that, while Dingell in the past has been very opposed to any changes, that kind of opposition is not as strong as it used to be.

Baker 3d, the White House aides said, and would include top officials from the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Agencies at Odds **********These three agencies have primary responsibility for regulating the nation's stock, options and futures markets, and have been at odds over who should emerge as the predominant regulator in an interconnected market that is still vulnerable to wild price swings. **********The details of the interagency committee were contained in letters sent last Friday by the Senate Banking Committee's chairman, William Proxmire, to Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, and the chairmen of the Fed, the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. **********In those letters, the Wisconsin Democrat referred to a conversation with Mr. Baker in which the White House chief of staff outlined the proposed interagency committee. **********''I was pleased to learn of the interest of the President to developing a response'' to the October crash, Mr. Proxmire said in his letter to Mr. Baker. ''And I hope the new interagency committee will be able to reach agreement.'' Exhaustive Studies Cited **********However, Mr. Proxmire noted that the agencies had already done exhaustive studies of the crash, had formulated their own recommendations, and that 90 days might be too long for Congress to wait. **********''Time is rapidly running out and the Congress may at the appropriate time be compelled to move ahead whether or not the principal agencies involved are in agreement,'' he told Mr. Baker. **********Mr. Proxmire added that he planned to go ahead with his request that the three agencies submit their legislative proposals in time for a hearing on March 31. Spokesmen for the S.E.C., the Fed and the C.F.T.C. would not comment on the proposed new committee. **********The Presidential task force, known as the Brady Commission, released the findings of its report in early January. Since then, the White House has had little to say about the events of Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points. Cool Response to Report **********On the day the report was issued, the Reagan Administration gave it a cool response, promising to study the findings carefully but not embracing any of the recommendations. Moreover, some within the Administration, particularly those who most strongly believe in keeping government out of the marketplace, privately complained about the intrusive nature of the recommendations and expressed the hope that they would never be adopted. **********''Clearly the Administration has been dragging its feet on the recommendations of the Brady report,'' said one top aide in the Senate Banking Committee, referring to the President's task force headed by Nicholas F. Brady, the investment banker and former New Jersey Senator. ''And they seem to be getting nervous about it.'' **********The Brady report outlined essentially four steps to prevent a recurrence of the events of Oct. 19: coordinating margin, or down payment, requirements on stock-index futures; unifying the clearing and settlement operations of the stock, options and futures markets; giving the Fed superagency authority to decide key issues affected by the stock and futures markets, and instituting coordinated ''circuit breakers,'' such as trading halts and price limits. Disagreement Over Findings **********Since the Brady report was released, there has been strong disagreement among the Fed, the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. over the Brady recommendations and their own findings. **********The Fed has rejected the idea that it become the primary regulator. The commodities agency has contended that current margin levels on stock-index futures are sufficient and should not be changed. And most notably, the S.E.C. has asked Congress to give it super-regulatory status over the C.F.T.C., especially the authority to regulate stock-index futures. **********Congressional aides suggested today that the White House saw the divisions among the regulators as potentially weakening its influence in formulating any legislative response to the October crash. **********In particular, the Administration appears opposed to any actions that would impose strong new government regulations on the market but faces a Democratically controlled House and Senate that could produce what it considers excessive new rules, such as requiring high margins on futures trading."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/business/in-quotes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN QUOTES", "print_headline": "IN QUOTES", "body_text": " **********''Within reason, you can still do hostile deals, but the bigger they are, the harder it is to raise money.'' - Carl C.

In fact, Japanese troops overran much of eastern China, killing several million people in the process. **********After World War II, an Allied tribunal in Tokyo convicted Japanese leaders of war crimes, and sentenced seven to death, including Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. The verdicts, Mr. Okuno said Monday, were a case of ''victors' punishment on the losers.'' **********But he insisted that that he wished ''to establish friendly Japan-China relations,'' adding, ''I have never spoken ill of China.'' **********Nevertheless, his insistence on repeating comments that China has labeled offensive put Mr. Takeshita in a bind, especially since the Prime Minister hopes to visit Beijing this summer. The Chinese reacted strongly to similar Okuno observations last month. When Japan's Foreign Minister, Sosuke Uno, visited Beijing last week, he was rebuked by his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen. Mr. Qian was quoted as complaining about a Cabinet member who had ''made remarks that lack good manners.'' Official Position Stated **********On April 22, after visiting the Yasukuni Shrine for Japan's war dead, Mr. Okuno said that ''Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety.'' He added: ''The white race had turned Asia into a colony. Japan was by no means the aggressor nation.'' **********Today, the Government's main spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, told a parliamentary committee that Japan's official position continued to be that it indeed was an aggressor in World War II. But he added that he would find out the ''true intention'' of the 74-year-old Mr. Okuno, who during the war was a prefectural director of the Kempeitai, the notorious secret police. **********The Okuno episode is hardly the first instance of a senior Japanese official seeking to gloss over Japan's aggression and atrocities before and during World War II, when it occupied most of Asia. Periodic protests have come from China and, to a lesser degree, from Korea, which were divided in 1945 after 35 years as a Japanese colony. **********In 1982 and 1986, China and South Korea issued formal protests over attempts here to sanitize textbook accounts of Japanese wartime role. A similar uproar arose in August 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the end of the war, when Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone made the first official visit to the Yasukuni Shrine by a postwar Japanese leader. **********The following year, Mr. Nakasone dismissed his Education Minister, Masayuki Fujio, for saying that the colonization of Korea was ''legitimate'' and that the 1937 massacre of Chinese civilians known as the ''Rape of Nanjing'' did not violate international law. **********Last January, a Japanese film distributor asked that newsreels of the ''Rape of Nanjing'' be cut from ''The Last Emperor'' before it could open in Japan. After the request became known, the embarrassed distributor backed down, and the footage stayed. **********Only two weeks ago, a group of 41 right-wing members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party issued a statement supporting Mr. Okuno, saying they agreed that Japan has been unfairly criticized about World War II."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/business/cftc-cites-refco-trades.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C.F.T.C.

Clarke, the Comptroller, in a speech presenting the study to the American Bankers Association's Stonier Graduate School of Banking in Newark, Del. ''The banks failed to establish and adhere to policies; they failed to develop managerial direction and routine that would see them through bad economic times.'' Counter to Current Arguments **********The study runs sharply counter to what many bankers and industry executives have been arguing: that the economy is primarily to blame for the failure of financial institutions. Indeed, many have pointed to Texas and other Southwestern states to argue that bankers had little hope of surviving the depressed oil, real estate and agricultural conditions in those areas over the last five years. **********William M. Isaac, head of the Secura Group, a consulting firm, and former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, disagreed with the study for that reason. **********''In the Southwest, there is a genuine depression going on,'' Mr. Isaac said. ''I don't know of anybody of any size that is not having serious problems. You will never convince me all those shops are poorly managed.'' Economy Not the Main Factor **********But a growing body of analysts has begun to question the role of economic conditions in bank failures, and the Comptroller's study is both the latest and the most definitive. **********In the Comptroller's study, agency officials examined 171 failed national banks, 51 that had come close to failure but recovered and 38 healthy ones of similar size and geographic location that had faced the same economic conditions. The study covered the period from 1979 through 1987. **********In January, the Comptroller released the initial results. But agency officials said they did not consider the study conclusive until they had found whether the healthy banks indeed had continuously strong managers, whether bad management contributed to the decline in the rehabilitated banks and whether reformed management practices led to recovery. 'Uninformed or Passive' **********The study found that half of the failed banks had boards that either ''lacked necessary banking knowledge or were uninformed or passive in their supervision of the bank's affairs,'' Mr. Clarke said. **********And more than half of the rehabilitated banks had similar inexperience among their directors during their declining days. **********The study found that most failed banks had no standard loan policies, poor documentation and inadequate systems to insure compliance with lending rules. Moreover, most were dominated by one key lending officer who made the important credit decisions and had no controls over loans to bank officials and other insiders. **********The Comptroller's office found that bank failures were also common among institutions that adopted ''overly aggressive'' growth policies, liberal lending practices and excessive reliance on ''volatile liabilities,'' like high-priced deposits. Inexperience at the Top **********But the study noted that, in addition to the laxity by directors, the lack of an experienced chief executive contributed most frequently to failures. The study found that two-thirds of failed banks had ''C.E.O.'s who clearly lacked the capability, experience or integrity necessary to make their banks successful.'' **********Although the Comptroller's office can remove management it considers either grossly inept or a threat to the soundness of the bank, a spokeswoman, Leonora S. Cross, disputed contentions that the Comptroller should remove management more often. **********''There are very strict guidelines that make it quite difficult to remove management,'' Ms. Cross said. ''It is not our responsibility to take over management and run a bank.'' **********Finally, Mr. Clarke said that insider abuse and fraud had led to the demise of banks in about one-third of the failures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/21/business/what-s-new-in-corporate-video-standing-ovations-for-shoes-and-socks.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Berger", "pub_date": "1988-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 553, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Standing Ovations for Shoes and Socks", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN CORPORATE VIDEO; Standing Ovations for Shoes and Socks", "body_text": " **********IT may seem like the dull television, but at the J. C. Penney Company, merchandise buyers have been known to watch lengthy television shows starring nothing but shoes, followed by more shoes - and then stick around for the sock show. **********While it may not be the stuff of high ratings, Penney's product shows are an example of business television at its best. Using satellite transmission from headquarters, the company's television network allows buyers around the country to pick and choose merchandise without having to get on an airplane. **********Other companies are finding business television equally useful. Merrill Lynch uses its network to inform brokers of its latest securities research. The Federal Express Corporation keeps its employees tuned in on weather. The Ford Motor Company broadcasts everything from news of plant closings to profit-sharing information. And Texas Instruments Inc. uses its network to broadcast computer education seminars. **********Private business television networks are in operation at about three dozen major American corporations. As recently as five years ago, only four companies could transmit information and there were fewer than 100 receiving stations. Today, private business networks broadcast to about 7,000 in-company sites. **********''There are so many things we can do with TV,'' said Al Bond, manager of business television at Texas Instruments. ''We can educate the public on technology, communicate directly with our customers, inform our entire sales force about a new development within an hour. It's tremendous.'' **********It can be expensive, however. Installing an ''up-link,'' used to transmit messages to a satellite, can cost $500,000. Broadcasters must rent satellite time at a rate of about $700 an hour. The biggest cost, though, comes at the receiving end. The ''down-links'' that connect the satellite to the individual receiving stations around the country can cost as much as $7,000 each to install. When Federal Express set up its vast network, it needed 800 down-links. If the costs seem significant, so is the impact. The technology may be changing the corporate culture in profound ways. For example, ''meeting the new boss'' these days can mean sitting in front of the tube. When A.T.& T. named Robert E. Allen as its chairman in April, Mr. Allen appeared on television in front of employees within a day. Proponents of business television laud this kind of ''immediate access'' to upper management. But detractors say such encounters are too impersonal. **********''When it comes to communicating with employees, video is much better than a memo, but its also much less effective than a handshake,'' said Tom Peters, a consultant based Palo Alto, Calif., and co-author of ''In Search of Excellence.'' **********For large corporations, however, the choice may be between video communication or no communication at all. ''Before we started using TV, there was much less communication with employees,'' said Jerry L. Sloan, a spokesman for Ford Motor, which has a five-day-week in-house news show. ''Today, I think employees feel that they're really involved in what's going on at the company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/19/world/gorbachev-urges-party-to-update-communist-theory.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1988-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GORBACHEV URGES PARTY TO UPDATE COMMUNIST THEORY", "print_headline": "GORBACHEV URGES PARTY TO UPDATE COMMUNIST THEORY", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, continuing his campaign for major changes in Soviet society, told Communist Party leaders today that key elements of Communist doctrine were outdated and calcified. **********In a speech on ideology at the conclusion of a two-day Central Committee meeting, Mr. Gorbachev repeatedly defended the proposals for change in the Soviet Union that he has lumped under the general rubric of ''perestroika.'' **********He also used the speech to defend his foreign policy initiatives, including the recently signed treaty with the United States on eliminating medium- and shorter-range land-based nuclear missiles. Change in Capitalist Threat **********Mr. Gorbachev said changes in the nature of capitalism, and a series of other factors, including the threat of nuclear war, the revolution in information and communications technology and environmental degradation, had altered the expansionist threat posed by capitalism. **********The Central Committee also announced several leadership changes after the closed meeting. The moves appeared to strengthen Mr. Gorbachev's hand, although not decisively.  [ Page A6. ]  Among the specific proposals made by Mr. Gorbachev today was one to hold a special Central Committee meeting to discuss policy toward the various nationalities within the Soviet Union, one of the touchiest problems in Soviet society today. Demonstrations for Autonomy **********In recent years, there have been demonstrations for more autonomy by various non-Russian peoples, including Kazakhs in Soviet Central Asia and Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians in the Baltic republics. **********Similarly, Soviet Jews, who are officially regarded as a nationality, have long been at odds with official policy aimed at limiting the autonomy of individual non-Russian groups. **********Proposing revised ideological principles, Mr. Gorbachev told the Central Committee that the philosophical legacy of Marx and Lenin should be adjusted to account for current domestic and international conditions. **********''It is necessary to remove the rust of bureaucratism from the values and ideals of Socialism,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''We are striving in the present conditions to revive the Leninist look of the new system, to rid it of accumulations and deformations, of everything that shackled society and prevented it from realizing the potential for Socialism in full measure. 'A New, Major Phase' **********''The international conditions under which we have started a new, major phase of our revolution differ essentially from those that existed during its previous stages,''he said. **********Mr. Gorbachev's speech, considered a major political statement, seemed intended to provide an ideological justification for his campaign to revitalize the Soviet Union and reshape its foreign policy. **********''The party has to literally fight for perestroika in production and in the spiritual sphere,'' he said, referring to his program of economic restructuring and his policy of greater openness. Initiative and Income Inequality **********He argued against the grain of recent Soviet thinking on several issues. For instance, Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet social system does not preclude disparities in income among those of different abilities. He contended that personal initiative, long smothered under the Soviet system, was at the heart of socialism. **********''We have lost and keep losing a lot because of our failure to unshackle grass-roots initiative, endeavor and independence completely,'' he said. ''This is the biggest, the hardest, but also the most important task of perestroika. And it will not be an exaggeration to say that everything today hinges on its fulfillment.'' **********But at the same time, the speech also seemed aimed at addressing the concerns of many Russians who have been unsettled by Mr. Gorbachev's leadership and the changes he has initiated. At times, the Soviet leader, who is General Secretary of the party, seemed defensive about his policies. 'Socialist Pluralism of Views' **********''For the first time in many decades we really feel the Socialist pluralism of views. This is something unaccustomed and is being assessed in different ways,'' he said. **********''We see that there is confusion in the minds of some people: Are we not retreating from the positions of Socialism, especially when we introduce new, unaccustomed forms of economic management and social life? Are we not revising the Marxist-Leninist teaching itself? **********''No wonder that there have emerged 'defenders' of Marxism-Leninism and mourners for Socialism who believe that both are under threat.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev said that his address, entitled ''Ideology of Renewal for Revolutionary Perestroika,'' was intended to raise some issues that would be discussed more fully in the months ahead as the party prepares for a special conference in June. **********The unusual meeting, which is likely to be a key test for Mr. Gorbachev, is expected to review his policies and may elect new members of the Central Committee. Free Development of Cultures **********The speech, distributed by the official press agency, Tass, alternated between defending the need for drastic change and assurances that he would not move too fast. **********The mixture seemed to reflect a desire to press ahead with change in a way that will not galvanize political opposition. **********Mr. Gorbachev, for instance, in his discussion of nationalities, called for the free development of national cultures within the Soviet Union while reminding the Central Committee that nationalism was unacceptable. **********''Soviet patriotism is the greatest of our values,'' he said. ''Any manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism are incompatible with it.'' 'Most Fundamental' Issue **********Calling nationalities policy ''the most fundamental, vital issue of our society,'' he proposed that the Central Committee devote a future full meeting to an examination of the problem. **********Mr. Gorbachev also seemed ambivalent about how far to push for openness in the press and in historical writings. **********Renewing his call for increased freedom of the press, and intensified efforts to look into sensitive chapters in Soviet history, he said, ''one can understand the impatience of the public wishing to take a look sooner at the closed pages of our past.'' **********But he added, in apparent sympathy with colleagues who have criticized recent articles and plays about history: ''It is impermissible when writings of the moment which obscure rather than ellucidate the truth are offered to the public instead of genuine scientific research. This must be stopped.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev seemed to indirectly question several articles that have appeared recently in the magazine Ogonyok, one of the most active practitioners of his policy of openness. **********His remarks also suggested agreement with an article in Pravda on Monday that sharply criticized ''Onward . . . Onward . . . Onward,'' a play by Mikhail F. Shatrov that is jammed with suppressed details of Soviet history and tantalizing speculation. The play, not yet staged, was published in the January issue of the literary monthly Znamya. **********While calling for a flowering of cultural expression, he also noted the contributions and achievements of previous eras in Soviet and Russian culture, a nod to conservative writers and artists. Economic Decline Reported **********Emphasizing the need for economic change, Mr. Gorbachev said the economy actually began to decline in size, rather than experience a slower rate of growth, in the early 1980's. He said this conclusion was based on calculations of economic growth that discounted revenue from the sale of oil abroad and the sale of alcoholic beverages in the Soviet Union. **********On matters of foreign policy, Mr. Gorbachev addressed several specific policy issues. **********Coming as close as he has to calling the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan a mistake, Mr. Gorbachev said, ''Certainly, comrades, our participation in the Afghan conflict is a very complex problem concerning many aspects of what we are overcoming in the course of perestroika and consistent translation of new thinking into a practical policy.'' **********While praising Washington for its effort to gain Senate ratification of the missile treaty, Mr. Gorbachev complained about continued anti-Soviet attitudes in the Reagan Administration. **********Mr. Gorbachev, talking about his foreign policy goals, said the key principle is ''recognizing that every people and every country have the freedom of social and political choice.'' **********''There is not a shade of utopia or illusion about it,'' he said. ''We are perfectly aware that it is not by diplomatic courtesies and not by propaganda that the West can be convinced of the need to recognize this principle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/24/business/oregon-magazine-sold.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oregon Magazine Sold", "print_headline": "Oregon Magazine Sold", "body_text": " **********Oregon magazine has been sold by New Oregon Publishers to Seattle-based Pacific Northwest Media Inc., which publishes Pacific Northwest, a monthly magazine.

Many companies, however, are concerned that the system will give A.T.&T. far too much power in setting the industry's future course. **********Unix has already given A.T.&T. a new influence. It is one of the few operating systems that can run different software programs on dozens of different computers. Most proprietary operating systems cannot. **********Government agencies and large corporations, such as General Motors, are demanding a single standard for operating systems, and in their eyes Unix is among the best models. **********At the same time, some of the strongest companies in the computer industry want to limit whatever advantages A.T.&T. may gain through its ownership of Unix. The Digital Equipment Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company complain that A.T.&T. appears to be maneuvering to outflank them and other makers of Unix-based computer products. **********''It is a matter of concern at the highest levels of every major computer company in the United States, and possibly the world,'' said Adam F. Cuhney, a technology analyst with Kidder, Peabody Inc., in San Francisco. **********The concern is that A.T.&T.'s new agreement to develop Unix technology solely with Sun Microsystems Inc., a fast-growing maker of scientific work stations, will put other makers of Unix-related products perpetually behind A.T.&T. and Sun in the race to market advanced Unix technology. **********They also fear that A.T.&T will gradually make Unix a proprietary product, usable only on A.T.&T. or Sun machines. Still, the rising pressure from customers for Unix-based products is forcing most computer makers to offer versions of their newest equipment with the Unix operating system. **********Forty-four companies, including Digital and the International Business Machines Corporation, sold 800,000 machines with the new Unix System V last year, according to Infocorp, a market research firm in Cupertino, Calif. In 1986, only 27 companies were involved. **********Gina Dolin, who follows software research for Infocorp, estimated that Unix machines would capture 36 percent of the worldwide market of computers sold in the price range of $12,000 to $350,000 in 1992. The figure last year was 24 percent, and in 1982, only 2 percent. **********Air Force officials jolted the industry last year when they insisted that any major computer maker planning to bid on the service's $4.2 billion program to upgrade computer operations - the largest Government computer purchase ever - must provide computers with Unix operating systems. Digital protested, but a review panel at the General Services Administration ruled against it. **********Moreover, in a few months, the National Bureau of Standards is expected to incorporate many Unix features into a formal industry standard, known as Posix, for the overall management of all essential computer functions. That standard, which must be approved by Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr., is expected to exert a great influence on computer design for years. **********Unix's staunchest advocates for years have been independent programmers in science and technology areas. They favored Unix for its flexible, logical and varied tools for creating new programs. One problem today, however, is that at least three variants of Unix now are used, and they are not fully compatible. **********A.T.&T. is trying to rally the industry around its latest model, the System V. Earlier this month, at a Dallas trade show, a vice president for the data systems group at A.T.&T., Jack M. Scanlon, told dozens of skeptical representatives from other companies that make computers with the Unix system that all future advances in Unix technology would conform to whatever standards are set by the Posix deliberations, in which several companies are involved. He also declared, in an obvious reference to Sun, that no vendor would be given preferential treatment on Unix advances. **********Edward J. Zander, vice president for corporate marketing at Sun, said in an interview that A.T.&T.'s association with Sun was similar to the alliance six years ago of I.B.M., Microsoft and Intel, the computer chip maker, that made the I.B.M. PC and Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system the standard technology for personal computers. **********''This is a way to get Unix out of the backroom and onto the desks of more and more professionals as well as into offices and the Federal Government,'' Mr. Zander said. ''It's a true open-environment alternative to what Digital and I.B.M. are offering.'' **********These arguments satisfied some companies, but not all. Many are suspicious that A.T.&T., which agreed last month to acquire up to 20 percent of Sun, plans eventually to buy all of Sun and turn Unix into its own proprietary operating system. **********''The A.T.&T. System V product does not meet the guidelines for true, open-standard software,'' Donald J. McInnis, a group vice president at Digital who heads its Unix product development, said in an interview. ''We think that when customers look at the details, they will understand the limitations of A.T.&T.'s approach.'' **********Kenneth Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development Inc., a consulting firm, said the debate was important because many companies were trying to determine how much of their research and development budgets they should commit to the Unix standard. **********''Until now, A.T.&T. more or less has been as good as its word,'' he said. ''But nobody can be quite sure that that is going to be the case in the future. This is an important turning point for many companies.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/25/business/advertising-shandwick-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Shandwick in Canada", "print_headline": "Advertising; Shandwick in Canada", "body_text": " **********For its ninth acquisition in North America, Britain's Shandwick P.L.C., a public relations concern, has made its first move into Canada, buying PIR (Public and Industrial Relations of Canada) Communications.

And some of the buying interest is being directed toward time shares. **********''Buyers who saw their savings shrink may want a slice of a second home, even if they are no longer willing to pay $250,000 for the whole thing,'' said Stephany A. Madsen, executive director of the Vacation Ownership Council (formerly the National Timesharing Council), a trade group sponsored by the American Resort and Residential Development Association. At an industry conference in Las Vegas, Nev., this week, Ms. Madsen said, developers were optimistic about the spring buying season. **********Some marketers, in fact, have been surprised by the rush of customers. ''So far this year, we are running 75 percent ahead of our sales projections,'' said Russell E. Brown, president of a time-share marketing company bearing his name based in Hilton Head, S.C. ''Consumers seem to be moving out of the stock market and into real estate they can use.'' **********Time sharing is not for everyone, of course. ''But if you feel comfortable with the amenities and layout of a resort, and if weekly rentals are expensive, why not plop down a few dollars up front,'' said Jeff Ducker, a certified public accountant with Rachlin & Cohen in Coral Gables, Fla. ''Then you know you can go there for the rest of your life.'' **********If a time share fits your needs, this probably is a fine time to buy, agreed Kathleen Muldoon, vice president of Carter Financial Management in Dallas. ''Time-share prices have suffered dramatically in some resort areas,'' she said. ''And it is a very appealing time to be locking in interest rates.'' **********More than a million Americans now own time shares, in which the buyer purchases the right to use a room, a villa or an apartment at a particular property for a specific time each year. Prices will vary with the season - a week at Aspen, Colo., costs more in January than in June - and with the size and luxuriousness of the accommodations. When time shares started in the United States about 15 years ago, they were primarily marketed in one- and two-week units. As the industry grew -about 1,000 projects now offer some kind of time sharing - variations emerged. In the last three years, for example, longer intervals have become increasingly popular. So a skier might buy a ''tenth'' (a five-week share) of a Colorado resort. A retired couple might choose a quarter share (a 13-week interval) of a Florida condominium. **********The average price of a one-week time share rose to $7,500 in 1987, from $7,000 a year earlier. Most quarter shares cost from $35,000 to $75,000. Average maintenance fees rose $20, to $212, for each week the owner is entitled to use the unit, according to the development association. The management company that receives the fee handles taxes, pays bills and tends to repairs and cleaning. **********About 85 percent of time-share offerings are ''fee ownership'' plans, in which the buyer gets title to the real estate. (The remainder are long leases, usually 20 to 40 years.) Customers typically put down 10 percent to 25 percent of the sales price and finance the remainder over five to seven years, often with the help of the developer. Banks rarely make conventional mortgage loans on time-share units. **********If people buy their time shares and use them as a second home, they are generally entitled to deduct any finance charges, said Robert Stein, a tax partner in the Miami office of Seidman & Seidman/ BDO. But if they choose to rent instead of buy, finance charges are treated as consumer interest and are only partly deductible. Customers who choose a leasehold arrangement will sometimes finance the deal by taking out a home equity loan on their primary residence, since interest on these loans remains fully deductible. **********Most experts advise people not to buy a time share unless they want to use it themselves, since the tax advantages of renting it out have greatly diminished under the 1986 tax law. ''The real benefit,'' Mr. Stein said, ''is that a time share can be a cheaper way to take a vacation, because you tie down the cost of your living accommodations.'' **********Prospective buyers need to allow time to do their homework. ''Don't buy into a resort in the back of the boonies, and don't buy on the first day,'' advised Kenneth Miller, president of the Miller Marketing Network in New York. ''Take the papers home. Ask for the names of five or 10 people who have owned their share for two or more years. If they don't give you these, don't buy into the project.'' (For a consumer's guide, send $2 and a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the Vacation Ownership Council, 1220 L Street N.W., Suite 510, Washington, D.C. 20005.) No matter how enticing the deal you cannot count on future appreciation, since the resale value of time-share units is generally low. ''No secondary market of any substance has developed,'' although there are exchange possibilities, said Morton Certilman, a New York lawyer and condominium specialist. **********Some contented owners do not care about resales. Six years ago Mr. Ducker, the C.P.A., spent $7,000 for a share of a two-bedroom unit on Sanibel Island, off the Gulf Coast of Florida. What might his one-week share be worth now? ''I don't know and I don't care,'' Mr. Ducker replied. ''I've gotten my money's worth out of it - and besides, it's not for sale.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/27/world/toward-the-summit-public-opinion-moscow-vs-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Public Opinion: Moscow vs. U.S.", "print_headline": "TOWARD THE SUMMIT; Public Opinion: Moscow vs. U.S.", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/15/business/inventories-rise-0.4-as-increase-slows.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inventories Rise 0.4% As Increase Slows", "print_headline": "Inventories Rise 0.4% As Increase Slows", "body_text": " **********Business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, less than half the increase of the previous month, as a rebound in car sales helped to reduce a huge backlog of unsold cars. **********The Commerce Department said today that inventories increased by $3 billion in January, pushing the total of unsold items on store shelves and backlots to a seasonally adjusted $705.85 billion. **********The gain followed even bigger increases of nine-tenths of 1 percent in both November and December.

Such stocks are probably the easiest way for small investors to participate in the junk-bond market, with most shares selling in the $8 to $10 range. **********Most of the closed-end, junk-bond funds are of recent vintage; many brought out by underwriters since October 1987. Jim Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said he would leave it to future historians to explain why so many junk-bond funds ''waited to get started until the greatest stock market crash of the 20th century.'' **********The substantial risk of investment in junk bonds, particularly in times of economic uncertainty such as now, is often disregarded by small investors. But it is not hard to see the attractions: the bonds offer a dividend yield four to eight percentage points higher than the average utility stock. Junk-bond funds also typically pay monthly dividends and may even have year-end capital gains distributions. **********The fund portfolios are constantly changing, and the managers may issue preferred stock or borrow heavily to augment the initial stake generated by the original public offering of stock. **********''The rating on the fund's debt or preferred stock is higher than the junk bonds they invest in,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, whose Miami investment firm tracks closed-end funds. ''Therefore, the cost to leverage the fund is lower than the yield being received on the junk bonds they invest in.'' **********By borrowing money at 10 percent and buying junk bonds at 14 percent, the managers can bolster the yields. They are, in effect, leveraging their leverage. Some funds also borrow on a short-term basis, at adjustable rates. **********To some people, all this financial legerdemain smacks of potential calamity. If short-term rates go higher than long-term rates, they could get squeezed; such an inversion of the yield curve may already be under way, many financial experts warn. **********And Mr. Herzfeld thinks that a severe recession - dare one say depression - could really crush a highly leveraged junk-bond fund. He posits the following scenario: A fund has a $150-million junk-bond portfolio, purchased with $100 million from the original stock offering and $50 million in borrowed money. A recession, or depression, bankrupts half the investments. The portfolio is now worth $75 million. But shareholder equity is really only $25 million. The net asset value of each share would decline by 75 percent, even though the market value fell by only 50 percent. **********Mr. Herzfeld is not suggesting that this will happen, although he expects the stock prices of junk-bond funds to sink further, especially if yields on more respectable securities rise. ''Our basic strategy is to sell them short, and it has worked out very well for us,'' he said. ''If there is a catastrophe, we're going to make a lot of money. If there isn't, we'll make a nice profit.'' **********Some market experts believe that predictions of mass defaults are themselves faulty. In a recent report, First Boston argued, ''U.S. companies are less leveraged today than were their major foreign counterparts during the last two recessions, and the high leverage in those countries did not end in disaster.'' First Boston also contended that since publicly traded companies are in a better position today than at any time in recent history to make interest payments, the ''acquisition orgy'' will continue. That, presumably, would lead to even more junk-bond funds. **********Mr. Herzfeld noted that junk-bond funds have done surprisingly well so far. The average junk-bond fund came to market at $10 a share and has fallen 8 percent in value in the last year or so. That performance is better than bond funds that invest in high-quality bonds, which have fallen about 10 percent in the last year. **********Investors, he said, are sticking with junk-bond funds because they offer high yields. Moreover, defaults in the junk-bond area have been few. **********Some funds were hurt when Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, but, for now, the basic premise of junk-bond fund logic -that the high coupon income will outrun losses from default - seems to be holding up. Mr. Herzfeld and other advisers believe that investors can safely leaven their portfolios with junk-bond funds, in small doses, to increase yield. **********Publicly traded junk-bond funds include Cigna High Yield Income Shares, the High Yield Income Fund, the High Yield Plus Fund, the High Income Advantage Trust, the High Income Advantage Trust II, the New America High Income Fund, the Zenith Income Fund, and the Kemper High Income Trust, which all trade on the Big Board, and two Amex-traded stocks, CIM High Yield Securities and the USF&G; Pacholder Fund. **********Mr. Herzfeld and Mr. Grant both said that many investors were reassured because fund sponsors and boards of directors often had respected names. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Herzfeld cautioned: ''These junk-bond funds are more speculative than people realize. People associate the names of the manager of the fund with the quality of the portfolio. But junk is junk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/world/candidates-urged-to-stifle-criticism.html": {"writer_name": "Julie Johnson", "pub_date": "1988-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 413, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CANDIDATES URGED TO STIFLE CRITICISM", "print_headline": "CANDIDATES URGED TO STIFLE CRITICISM", "body_text": " **********Concerned about the safety of a kidnapped United States marine in Lebanon, the White House admonished political candidates today not to make hostage-taking an issue in the Presidential campaign. **********''It's very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.

McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing giant founded in 1909, has had a McGraw at the helm through two world wars, the Depression and into the electronic era. **********But times change. The family today owns less than 20 percent of the company and is split into many factions. A wave of takeovers that has swept through the publishing industry may well engulf McGraw-Hill. And there are real questions about whether current management can keep the company independent so that the next generation of McGraws - the great-grandchildren of founder James H. McGraw - can follow in the footsteps of their forebears. **********Last week, the company announced a reorganization that increases the power of Harold W. McGraw 3d - known as Terry - the 38-year-old heir apparent and son of the chairman emeritus, Harold W. McGraw Jr. The younger Mr. McGraw, a member of the corporate board, leaves his post as president of the McGraw-Hill Publications Company - where he received mixed reviews - to head the Financial Services Company, which includes Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********''Terry's in the running to run the company,'' said an outside adviser to McGraw-Hill. ''The sense of family pride runs strong in Terry. It's the same sense of destiny that was present in Harold.'' **********All this comes as investor interest in publishing companies has pushed up industry shares in general, and McGraw-Hill's, too. The stock, which was trading at around $48 a share at the beginning of the year, closed this week at $61 on rising volume. The stock runup is, in part, a reaction to the continuing bidding battle for Macmillan Inc., which has brought a new focus on McGraw-Hill as one of the few remaining independent publishers. The company's reorganization represents another step in its implemention of a ''market focus'' strategy. The strategy is intended to streamline operations and turn the company into an information and multimedia giant more efficient and so well-integrated that it would be difficult for a raider to sell off unrelated divisions. **********But many analysts question whether a simple reorganization is enough to mask the more fundamental problem that has made McGraw-Hill a perennial takeover target: The company's many businesses are simply not profitable enough, especially when compared with industry averages. **********The second-quarter earnings that were released last week are indicative of the problems facing McGraw-Hill. While the earnings showed a respectable 12 percent gain to $44.8 million on revenues of $443.8 million, they also contained one-time charges and gains that reflected the company's checkered acquisitions strategy. **********The report included $110 million in aftertax write-offs - reflecting, in large part, the company's acquisitions of Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting group; and Monchik-Weber, which provides computerized financial data. The write-offs are, in effect, an acknowledgment that these acquisitions have fallen far below expectations. **********''McGraw-Hill really needs to get its house in order if it is to remain independent,'' said Peter P. Appert, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence. ''You have sharks circling, and the company needs to get its stock price higher through improved profitability. Otherwise, someone will come along and do it for them.'' **********FOR Terry McGraw, the question becomes whether incumbent management -primarily the chairman and chief executive, Joseph L. Dionne - is up to the challenge. A former English and social studies teacher, the 54-year-old Mr. Dionne was hailed as a great new hope when he was promoted to his current position in 1983. But so far, he has been unable to speed up a torpid growth rate and reverse a tendency to make acquisitions that inevitably perform far below their initial promise. **********''Dionne is as frustrated as Wall Street is with McGraw-Hill's inability to deliver the numbers,'' said Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''He's trying to find the right combination of businesses and people and he hasn't found it yet.'' **********McGraw-Hill, which celebrates its centennial this year, is a collection of businesses that have been spewing out information for years. Its flagship publication, Business Week magazine, in starting two months before the 1929 crash, offered a warning that the economy was in trouble. The company is the nation's largest publisher of textbooks, with some 20,000 titles a year and the largest publisher of trade journals, with more than 80 technical publications and newsletters. It also owns Standard & Poor's, a major credit-rating agency, as well as four television stations. **********''McGRAW-HILL has a wonderful base to build on,'' said Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor who consulted for the company in the early 1980's.''The great agony, however, is how to unleash the power of this machine.'' **********That is the task facing Mr. Dionne, who has been trying to transform the company into a computerized information powerhouse by repackaging written data in electronic form. This drive has taken longer than expected, fueling speculation that perhaps Mr. McGraw is being groomed none too soon. **********As Mr. Dionne fights his battles in the marketplace, the younger Mr. McGraw is busy establishing his reputation within the company. (Neither Mr. Dionne nor Mr. McGraw would be interviewed, nor would the company make anyone else available.) Terry McGraw is in an unusual position. His family has neither economic nor voting control of the company bearing its name, but they appear to have designated him as the next top executive. But exactly when is anyone's guess. **********''As long as the McGraw family has a large stake in McGraw-Hill, Terry is the heir apparent,'' said Kevin Gruneich, a publishing industry analyst with the First Boston Corporation. ''Joe Dionne will stay and run the company until Terry is ready to take over, and I don't see that happening in the next year or two.'' Many outside and inside McGraw-Hill describe Terry McGraw as a tightly wound young man with a guarded demeanor. He maintains a polished exterior that covers feelings that are kept hidden, they say. **********Mr. McGraw was previously with General Telephone and Electronics (now the GTE Corporation), after graduating from Tufts University and earning an M. B. A from the Wharton School. In the eight years that he has been with McGraw-Hill, he has leapfrogged through a variety of assignments designed to hone his leadership skills, including stints in corporate planning and as a publisher of several trade publications. **********He remains an enigma to many employees, while he has alienated others, some of whom have since left. **********''Terry is a guy who manages from behind closed doors,'' said Charles Elbaum, vice president of Periodical Studies Service, a consulting firm that works in the publishing industry. ''He has his own idea of what's right and what's wrong. He plays his hand very, very close, and the employees complained that he tied their hands and wouldn't let them do anything.'' **********While president of the publications company - the trade publications plus Business Week - Mr. McGraw sold a variety of small industrial magazines, made some small acquisitions and earned praise for cutting costs and eliminating deadwood. **********AT the same time, he appeared unable to turn around a slippage in many of the company's trade publications, while taking actions that resulted in the departure of several key and well-respected executives - including a top advertising salesman at Business Week. **********He also decided to suspend publication of Business Week Careers magazine, which in its five-year life had been unable to attract enough advertisers or readers. The decision surprised many, since it came just months after the company announced a major push into consumer publications. Mr. McGraw also tried, and failed, to sell the floundering chemical industry publications. **********Meanwhile, say company insiders, he seems painfully aware of who he is. Many who work at Business Week recall a speech he gave to the magazine's writers last fall - a rambling monologue, they say, that made constant references to his father. According to one staff member, Mr. McGraw ''talked about pleasing his father and displeasing his father and of being afraid of that. He seemed terribly unsure of himself.'' **********Others praise Mr. McGraw. ''He's a very bright, very hard-working guy who has lots of skills and the right name,'' said one outside adviser. ''He's a versatile, nice person who knows the business operations.'' **********The reorganization will have its own casualties. There is talk within the publishing industry that more magazines at McGraw-Hill may be folded and that plans for new ones will be shelved. And, already, some senior executives have departed. **********Among the recent high-level departures are Howard Hosbach, chairman and chief executive of Standard & Poor's, and Paul McPherson, an executive vice president at the Publications Company, who had been overseeing an attempt to step into consumer magazine publishing. There is also talk that the reorganization could lead to cost-cutting in the form of layoffs. **********The reorganization has not affected Mr. McGraw's brother, Robert, who joined the company after his 1976 graduation from Princeton and who has held a variety of positions. Robert, 34, is an executive vice president in the Healthcare Group, but does not have a seat on the board. **********McGRAW-HILL'S reorganization comes at a time when its core businesses have been hampered by unfavorable market conditions, by top-heavy layers of high-priced managers and by an inability to move as swiftly as first thought into the electronic age. **********Earnings in the book division in 1987 fell to $40 million from $70 million a year earlier. A soft market for business advertising cut into the ad revenues at Business Week. Unsettled financial markets have hurt earnings at Standard & Poor's. **********In fact, in every one of its five major lines of businesses, McGraw-Hill underperforms industry averages, according to statistics compiled by Mr. Appert at C. J. Lawrence. McGraw-Hill's book company had an 8 percent operating margin in 1987, compared with an industry average of 10 to 15 percent; its broadcasting division had a 29 percent operating margin, compared with others that return 40 percent; its magazine division had a 13 percent operating margin, compared with 17 percent at a major competitor, Time Inc. **********''The problem at McGraw-Hill is that there are a lot of big bombs going off and the little successes they have had have not been enough to offset it,'' Mr. Atorino said. **********Joseph E. Kasputys, a former McGraw-Hill executive and now chief executive of the Primark Corporation, said: ''The company is a portfolio which, in any given year, one piece is not going well. Once it hits on all cylinders, it can really go.'' **********That is what makes the company so vulnerable to attack - particularly in light of the battle between Robert Maxwell and the Robert M. Bass Group for Macmillan Inc. and the aborted attempt by Mr. Maxwell to acquire Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. last year. Given the prices offered for these companies, analysts estimate that McGraw-Hill's break-up value is between $100 to $115 a share, which is where analysts say the bidding could go in a battle for the company. **********ONE big question is who would make such a bid. Some arbitragers say they do not believe the reorganization was sufficient to release values locked in the company and have decided not to buy. **********Others say that most interest is focused on Macmillan because, unlike McGraw-Hill, it could probably be acquired on a friendly basis. **********Still, McGraw-Hill's stock continues to rise. Among the names being circulated as buyers: Gulf and Western, Dun & Bradstreet,the Times Mirror Company, the International Thomson Organization and Reed International. Some have also speculated that McGraw-Hill might turn to buyers - General Electric, A. T. &T. or the regional phone companies, for example - that would resist selling off its parts, protecting the publisher's operating independence. **********Fending off takeovers is nothing new at McGraw-Hill, a company that showed its mettle with its valiant fight in 1979 in the face of a nearly $1 billion bid from American Express. **********But the game is tougher now - and family solidarity may be a bit shaky. ''I doubt whether the family would stay unified this time,'' said John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''It's clear that Harold McGraw Jr. and his side of the family will stick together. But whether all the cousins would vote the same way is less clear.'' **********The McGraw holdings are considered by some investment bankers to be ''helpful, but not very'' in fighting a raider. ''The family block is not really enough to block anything,'' said one takeover expert, who declined to be identified. **********The company has virtually no debt on its balance sheet and is fairly cash-rich. This raises some questions about whether the company, to repel a raid, would borrowing heavily to recapitalize or to go private. **********One drawback that might discourage a potential raider is that recent changes in the tax laws have made it less attractive for raiders to acquire a company and then finance the purchase through the sale of corporate assets. And the ''market focus'' strategy may make it difficult to peel away assets that don't fit into the company's strategic focus. **********What's more, McGraw-Hill's bitter and successful battle against American Express has become a business legend. Harold McGraw Jr., who began his career at the company as a book editor, took the American Express bid personally. Usually mild, he unleashed a tough defense, and in advertisements, accused American Express of lacking ''integrity and corporate morality.'' **********That legacy may not deter a present-day raider, though. With the family thought to be less unified and hostile takeovers commonplace, another attack may bring a different outcome. ''No one since American Express has shown up,'' said Mr. Reidy. ''But the stock continues to run up; a story about the company is being told on Wall Street.''

But many privately give the opposition the edge. **********Mr. Aylwin, surrounded by leaders of the 15 other parties in the Command for the No, made his appeal as the hard-fought campaign neared its official end. No campaigning or publicity will be permitted during the two days before the voting. Violence Is Feared **********''We are worried that, faced with the probability of a 'no' victory, the Government or ultra-rightist groups will cause violence at the last minute that will serve as a pretext to avoid the plebiscite,'' he said. **********''We are fully aware that Chile is passing through a crucial and delicate moment,'' he said, urging people ''to stay calm and not let themselves be frightened or provoked.'' **********''In case the Government will not recognize the triumph of the no,'' he continued, ''we will count on popular backing.

Jimmy Carter rode Gerald Ford out of the White House with a severe recession fresh in voters' minds and inflation picking up speed. Ronald Reagan then rode Mr. Carter out, months after another recession and when inflation and interest rates were raging. But this time around, Mr. Reagan's heir apparent, George Bush, presides over an economy that has been free of recessions and soaring prices for the extraordinary stretch of almost six years. Things look downright serene, at least compared to the turbulent 1970's. **********People do not win elections just because of the economy, of course. Big wars influence elections more. Emotional issues - abortion, school prayer, ethics in government, minority rights, nuclear arms and gun control - swing some votes, as do resonant slogans and the style and personalities of the candidates. But in Presidential campaigns of this century, incumbents who have had the economy on their side have almost always won. ''I remember my mentor, George Gallup, saying, 'There's just one irrevocable truth,' '' said Mervin Field, the dean of California pollsters. ' ''If you have peace and prosperity, there is no way an incumbent administration can lose.' '' **********Yet Mr. Dukakis is running hard, and late last week some polls showed him neck-and-neck again after losing ground following the Republican convention. With a new television promotion called ''Bringing Prosperity Home,'' with allusions to a ''Swiss-cheese economy,'' appeals to ''economic patriotism,'' and promises of ''good jobs at good wages,'' he is raiding the battleground of the economy that the Republican incumbent would seem to already own. Does the Governor of Massachusetts know something the precedents do not? **********He surely does, but so does George Bush. They both see this as a quite different election from those of the past, with few of the usual guideposts to steer by. Old distinctions between big-spending, tax-the-rich Democrats and budget-balancing, free-market Republicans have blurred. Both camps are promoting neither big government nor small, but frugal government. In a race as close as this one looks, both rest their hopes on the votes, not of the poor or of the rich, but of a fickle middle class. **********Mr. Dukakis's strength in keeping abreast of Mr. Bush shows up in poll after poll, persuading many political experts that middle-class voters believe he offers them something the Republicans do not. They say a striking feature of 1988, setting it apart from previous election years, is middle-class anxiety about the future economy that belies widespread contentment about the present. ''There's a lot of data showing the public caught up with a conflict between current economic conditions and concern about the future,'' Mr. Field said. ''It's the first time I've seen that in nearly 50 years or measuring public opinion.'' **********The anxiety, concentrated among many of the 30.5 million families with annual incomes of $20,000 to $50,000, is surfacing in the wake of the changes that swept through the economy in recent years, like the rise of the working woman and explosion of budget deficits. It reflects worries over the soaring costs of college tuitions and medical care, the next recession's toll on debt-laden families, the anguish of parents who try to combine work with rearing children, young people's difficulties in buying homes, the deterioration of the environment and the intrusion of foreign influence into a once largely self-contained American economy. **********''If you ask Americans about their own personal situation - how they think they're doing - you find an extraordinary level of optimism,'' said Karlyn Keene, a student of polling at the American Enterprise Institute. ''If you ask about the country's economic future, there's an enormous amount of unease and concern. That's the dichotomy in the polls, and Dukakis is trying to respond to the concern about the future.'' **********The Bush campaign doubts that there is such a dichotomy, and even if there is, Bush officials say, the anxiety reflects fears that a Democrat might rob the middle class of its Reagan-era prosperity - not fears of what another Republican President might do. ''Insofar as there is any anxiety,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's issues director, ''it's because people don't want to lose the tremendous gains they've achieved.'' **********The Dukakis campaign, by contrast, cites an early August New York Times-CBS poll suggesting that whatever it is that the middle class wants, Mr. Dukakis is more likely to deliver it. Fifty-six percent of those polled said Democrats would do more to help the middle class, while 28 percent said the Republicans would do more. **********''The issue is the future, not the past,'' said Christopher F. Edley Jr., Mr. Dukakis's issues director. ''The question is which candidate understands the challenges that lie ahead. Dukakis believes that a middle-class squeeze, resulting from stagnant real wages, declining international competitiveness and sluggish growth and investment, creates anxieties that voters want the next President to address.'' **********THE best known student of the economy's influence on elections, Prof. Ray C. Fair at Yale, devised a formula 12 years ago to predict elections. When he plugs the statistics on the current economy into his equations, the result indicates that the Democrats would lose, with 48 percent of the vote. But the average error in the formula is about three percentage points, he said, ''so the election could easily go either way.'' **********Yet with nearly six years of solid growth and relatively low inflation, with interest rates that are less than half their levels at the start of the decade, with unemployment back to the levels of the early 1970's, why isn't Mr. Fair predicting a Republican landslide? **********It is the change in the rate of growth, not the level, that impresses voters most, he said, especially during the six to nine months preceding the election. And neither inflation, at around 4.5 percent, nor the rate of economic growth, now about 3 percent, has changed much in recent months. **********''At the top of an economic expansion, people start to get nervous,'' he said. By emphasizing the problems the economy may encounter in the future and playing on voter nervousness, he said, the Democrats have devised a strategy that could put them in the White House. **********But if that is a winning strategy, political experts say Mr. Dukakis could do more to exploit it. Vice President Bush has blunted the Dukakis message to some extent in offering free-market Republican solutions to the same anxieties, they say. He promises tax breaks to help parents pay for day care, for example, and a reduction in the capital gains tax, to 15 percent from 28 percent, which could appeal to middle-class small-business owners, as well as to the rich. **********Then last week, in a day-to-night break with Reagan Administration policies, Mr. Bush appealed to a prominent concern of the middle class by offering a host of proposals to clean up the environment. Mr. Dukakis, political analysts add, may be blunting his own middle-class appeal by harping on historical Democratic themes of limited interest to the middle class, like unemployment, saving old industries, and giving Government a bigger hand in the affairs of industry and labor. **********''HE'S not doing well with this issue yet,'' said Kevin P. Phillips, a Republican political consultant. ''Maybe he's trapped in his own bubble of the Massachusetts miracle. If he fully understood all these things in the economy, he'd have a series of powerful issues.'' With Mr. Bush's success in diverting the debate to the pollution in Boston Harbor and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, Mr. Dukakis conceded last week, ''It's been a little difficult to get through. **********Governor Dukakis's opportunity to break the old precedents resides in an economy that has been undergoing extraordinary changes, arguably the most important of the century. Although disruptive, the Depression of the 1930's and the war of the 1940's turned out to be interludes in the nation's progress in becoming the world's biggest, richest, most emulated economy. Its composition and structures - its industrial foundations, its systems of taxation, budgeting and regulation, its commitment to free enterprise, its self-sufficiency - remained intact. **********By contrast, in the 1970's and 1980's, the whole terrain of the economy has been shifting. Because of both Reagan policies, especially those that let the dollar soar in the first half of the 1980's and inexorable forces in the world economy, jobs in the backbone manufacturing industries have been drifting abroad and the membership in big labor unions has been eroding as well. **********In 1970, 43 percent of all women worked, and by the start of the 1980's, just over half had jobs. Now 57 percent - 50 million women - work, making the traditional family of the father-breadwinner and the mother-housewife a shrinking minority. The two-worker incomes now buy what the income of one did when Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis were growing up. Two of the biggest family expenses, college tuitions and medical care, have far outrun other costs in the 1980's, straining even the double incomes. **********Some statistics on family and individual well-being show gains in the course of the Reagan years, but whether Americans are significantly better off than they were as far back as the Nixon years is a matter of dispute. **********The Government reported last week that median family income, adjusted for inflation, reached a peak of $30,853 last year, about $2,000 above the level in 1980 and about the same as the $30,820 of the previous peak in 1973. Today's families look better off, however, because they're smaller. **********Poverty seems a little less acute now, too, compared with the start of the 1980's. The poverty rate has slipped from 14 percent in 1981 to 13.5 percent last year. Yet that is still well above the record low of 11.1 percent in 1973. Average weekly earnings this year, after discounting for inflation, are about $30 below the peak reached in 1972. The gap between the nation's richest and poorest, static for years, has stretched in the 1980's. **********And where incomes appear to have grown, spending has been climbing even faster. People are saving half as much of their pay as they did in the 1970's and borrowing more. ''It now takes two wage earners working full time to bring home enough bacon for the average household,'' Mr. Field said. ''That's the biggest change in the economy.'' **********Then, in competition with other countries, the nation with a once unparalled standard of living has been steadily losing its edge. True, the Reagan years have seen the creation of hundreds of thousands of new businesses and 14 million new jobs, far and away the best performance among the advanced countries. And with population growth slowing and the labor force's nearly complete absorption both of women who want to work and of the baby boomers, unemployment appears to have reached a lower level where it is likely to stay except in bad recessions. **********But America's investment in the factories and businesses of the future lags that of competing countries, in part because their interest rates are lower. Other nations may be adding fewer jobs, but that's partly because of the premium they put on efficient production. This makes it harder for America to provide the high-paid jobs of the 1990's. **********Foreigners, meanwhile, have started buying up American factories, many in burgeoning, cutting-edge industries. Foreign investment raises fears about who will control the new technologies and about how investors in Frankfurt or Tokyo or Seoul might treat their American workers if business turns sour. In part because politicians in Washington doubled the national debt to a once-unimaginable $2 trillion in the 1980's, the world's biggest lender nation has become the biggest borrower, leaving control of its destiny exposed to the whims of foreign creditors. **********FOR Vice President Bush, the trick is to address those concerns without impugning the Reagan record. His strategy has been to promise a brighter future, but with continuity, too. In defense of the Reagan record of relentless growth and shrinking unemployment, he says, ''Don't let them take it away.'' And in tacit admission that some people were bypassed, he promises to spread the bounty of the Reagan economy to the Louisianas and West Virginias of the country where the unemployment rate lingers in double digits. **********Politicians look for ways to simplify the economic issues that concern voters most so that they can be milked for maximum advantage. Democrats once devised a ''misery index,'' the total of the unemployment and inflation rates, and they used it against President Ford. Now, Vice President Bush is using the same gauge but calling it a ''prosperity index.'' Civilian unemployment last month was 5.6 percent, a bit above the year's low and down to the pre-Carter levels. And inflation is a third the level at the start of the 1980's. **********BUT the misery index may no longer capture the concerns of the middle class. Democrats say, for example, that the low unemployment rate may reflect the fact that some mothers work to make ends meet, not because they want to. Mr. Phillips, the Republican consultant, believes other guages would better capture the current anxieties of most voters. He suggests an ''economic quality of life index'' that would track family incomes and wages, and an ''economic independence index'' that would combine the interest that Americans pay to foreign creditors, the money Americans owe to foreigners, the trade deficit, and conspicuous things that foreigners own, ''such as prominent buildings in New York and Los Angeles.'' **********In response to middle-class concerns about the quality of life and the future economy, Mr. Dukakis has been offering a variety of programs that also take account of people's apprehension about budget deficits. **********To respond to concerns about health-care costs, for example, he would require that all employers provide medical benefits for the 37 million workers and dependents who, he says, are not covered. To help younger workers who have been denied home ownership by the soaring prices and stable incomes of recent years, he would have the Government provide seed money to induce business and local governments to build affordable housing. **********He would rely on similar partnerships to spawn industries capable of competing with foreigners. At a mere first-year cost to the Federal Government of $500 million, he says he would steer the new industries in such fields as plastics, ceramics and advanced electronics into the holes of ''Swiss-cheese economy'' - those he says the Reagan-era prosperity has left behind. **********To train the industries' managers, engineers and skilled workers, he would restore guaranteed loan programs for college students and encourage the states to establish ''economic opportunity funds'' for students. Those who choose a career in teaching would get added breaks as part of an effort to put American schools on a competitive footing with those of Japan and Germany. He would liberalize pension laws to permit people to carry pensions from job to job, bring women's pay up to the level of men's and help working families meet the costs of child care. **********Such objectives are not very different from those of the Bush campaign, but the means of meeting them are. Mr. Dukakis would rely more on the carrots and sticks of Government to goad the policies along. By deciding where to spread seed money, Government would in effect be picking and choosing the industries and jobs of the future. Mr. Bush prefers to allow the marketplace to make those decisions.  Mr. Dukakis says he would run a penny-pinching government, committed to whittling down the budget deficits, just as Mr. Bush says he would. But there would still be a cost for his programs, at least until the Dukakis economy's new businesses began yielding profits and tax revenues, and the once-depressed communities began getting along without aid. Ultimately, the cost would be borne by the consumer - through higher tax payments to the state-government partners in the Dukakis programs or through higher prices that industry would charge to pass on the cost of medical benefits. The Dukakis campaign declines to estimate these costs. **********Beyond the cost, Republicans say the Dukakis policies smack of the ''heavy hand'' of government. But Mr. Dukakis insists that by relying on government initiative and sharing the burden with business and state and local governments, his government would not be as heavy-handed as the bigger governments of previous Democratic Presidents; and he says it would be quicker and more effective than the Republicans' marketplace. **********''You would see a less laissez faire form of Government than under Bush,'' said Mr. Dukakis's top economist, Lawrence H. Summers. ''You would see a Government that would try to lend a helping hand, not a heavy hand.'' **********Some Democratic political analysts think Mr. Dukakis blurs his appeal to the middle class by dwelling on jobs when most people who want them already have them. They also believe it is a mistake to dwell on the holes in the economy when the long depressions in the Farm Belt and the Rust Belt seem to be abating. He should concentrate instead, they say, on doing more to help the two-income family. ''If the Democrats campaign on the holes in the cheese it's going to be a losing battle because I don't think the holes are big enough,'' said Alvin From, director of the Democratic Leadership Council, an association of moderate Democratic politicians. **********Horace Busby, a consultant and a former White House assistant to President Johnson, said: ''Why this 'good jobs at good wages?' It's happening anyway. True, people earning $25 an hour making steel are losing their jobs. In harping on that, he's trying to keep alive something that does not reflect the realities of the marketplace.'' **********AS compelling as the Democrats find the anxiety of the middle class, neither they nor the Republicans have confronted issues that could cause the middle class more discomfort than the loss of one spouse's job or the payment of college tuitions: military spending, the relentless rise of spending for Social Security, and the burden of the budget deficits. **********How, for example, would the next President deal with the Federal budget if the economy slipped into a recession? The usual pattern is to cut deficits during economic expansions and to let them grow in recessions, as the Government spends more to help the unemployed and stimulate economic growth. But with the deficit likely to be large whenever the economy enters a recession, would the next President let it rise higher? **********Rather than answer such questions, both candidates, like their predecessors, are indulging in the ''politics of campaigning,'' which a Bush official says differs from the ''politics of governance.'' They will not say they would raise taxes, a quick and often effective way to cut deficits. But once in office, political analysts predict, both might raise taxes before another recession. **********''The main plank in Mr. Bush's economic platform is his promise that he will never raise taxes,'' writes Herbert Stein, President Nixon's chief economic adviser. ''That is like a small boy's declaration that he will never go to the dentist again - sincerely meant but of little predictive value. Mr. Bush's position is generally understood to be that, like Mr. Dukakis, he will raise taxes only as a last resort - but that his last resort would come after Mr. Dukakis's.''

Share Price Soars **********In the wake of widespread forecasts that the company was worth far more than $45 a share, Koppers stock soared yesterday to $51.75, up $6.625, in heavy trading. At one point in the day, Koppers stood as high as $52.375. **********The share price, which has been advancing steadily in the last few weeks, stood at $39.50 a week ago, jumping almost $6 at that point, in exceptionally heavy trading. **********The New York Stock Exchange announced on Wednesday that it had asked the company to issue a statement to explain whether there was anything to account for the unusual activity, but the company refused. Koppers said yesterday that it would have no comment. The exchange said it had begun a routine analysis to determine whether further investigation was warranted. Clamor for Road Repairs Noted **********John Henry, who reports on Koppers for Merrill Lynch & Company, said last Friday that the company would be a major beneficiary of a growing clamor to sharply increase government spending for bridge and highway repairs - to $90 billion a year until the year 2000. He forecast yesterday that Koppers stock might bring as much as $55 a share. Oppenheimer & Company said it thought the stock was worth $57 a share, while Bear, Stearns & Company felt that it might bring between $53 and $57. **********On the basis of the stock's strong run-up, traders seemed to be in agreement that either Beazer would sweeten its offer or someone else would outbid it. The Reuters news agency said that Hanson P.L.C. and Imperial Chemical Industries, both British companies, might also be interested. **********Attracted by the weak dollar, British companies earmarked more than $25 billion last year to buy American companies, or nearly 13 percent of all takeovers. British activity so far this year has more than doubled. Beazer Investment the Largest **********In its announcement, Beazer described itself as the ''largest owner'' of the bidding company, known as BNS Inc. The name combines the initials for Beazer, Natwest and Shearson. **********People close to the venture said that BNS was investing $225 million in the new company and that about $200 million of that amount would come from Beazer. The other two would provide the rest. **********Shearson would also provide $465 million in bridge loans, or temporary financing, with the loans expected to be repaid later through the sale of junk bonds. Citibank will head a bank lending group expected to provide unspecified additional funds that are understood to total $675 million. **********Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission added that if the deal were successful, the Beazer group might sell Koppers's chemicals business and, if necessary for antitrust reasons, an aggregates plant in Southern California. It said that, if need be, it might also sell additional assets to repay debt. Reasoning Behind Offer **********Asked why Beazer was seeking Koppers, J. Tomilson Hill, co-head of mergers at Shearson, said that ''about a year ago, Beazer bought Gifford-Hill & Company, a major cement and aggregates company. **********''This is a further extension of Gifford-Hill's aggregates business in the United States,'' he said of the Koppers bid. **********Under an agreement among the bidders, Shearson's interest in BNS, the bidding company, would be converted into preferred stock in a new company that would own Koppers. As a result, Shearson would become a preferred stockholder in the new company. It has, however, granted bridge loans for several years. **********The new form of Shearson investment, described by investment bankers as ''bridge equity,'' provides that temporary funds to buy the company are later converted into preferred stock in the new company. **********Mr. Hill called the move ''a creative use of capital to facilitate a client's objective.'' **********If the deal is completed, Shearson could earn financing and advisory fees exceeding $14 million, S.E.C. documents showed yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/28/world/soviet-rights-aides-get-a-new-word-dissident.html": {"writer_name": "Felicity Barringer", "pub_date": "1988-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 813, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Rights Aides Get A New Word: Dissident", "print_headline": "Soviet Rights Aides Get A New Word: Dissident", "body_text": " **********The official Soviet Human Rights Commission found itself playing unwilling host to one of the country's leading dissidents today at an unusual and volatile meeting with Western human-rights advocates. **********At a gathering that teetered between courtesy and rancor for five hours, Fyodor Burlatsky, chairman of the Soviet Human Rights Commission, reluctantly bowed to the insistence of delegates from the International Helsinki Federation and allowed the dissident, Lev Timofeyev, to speak. **********Mr. Burlatsky's newly formed Human Rights Commission is sanctioned by the Soviet Government although not officially a Government agency. The commission, including a variety of legal, political and literary figures, was created last year as the Soviet Government pushed its quest to have a broad-based international human rights conference in Moscow. **********The United States and other Western countries have thus far not agreed to such a conference, but Mr. Burlatsky's group is planning televised hearings on Soviet domestic human rights issues next month. It also broke new ground by inviting a visit from members of the Helsinki Federation, long scorned here as a center of anti-Soviet propaganda. Showcase for Tension **********On Wednesday, the first meeting between members of the fledgling Burlatsky commission and the firm, sometimes hectoring Helsinki Federation representatives became a showcase for the tension and mistrust that underlie the East-West dialogue on human rights. **********The presence of Mr. Timofeyev and his colleagues, Larisa Bogoraz and Sergei Kovalev, who were escorted to the meeting by members of the International Helsinki delegation, brought those tensions to the surface. The request that Mr. Timofeyev speak, first made peremptorily and then repeated with more courtesy, nearly set those tensions alight. **********Mr. Burlatsky, who at first resisted what he called ''a confrontation, a scandal and a show,'' twiddled his pen with poorly concealed irritation as Mr. Timofeyev, a former prisoner and a leading human rights advocate, argued for the release of all remaining Soviet prisoners convicted of political crimes. **********''I think Mr. Burlatsky was in an extremely difficult situation for a Soviet citizen and I think he handled it extremely well - in the end,'' said Robert Bernstein, chairman of Helsinki Watch, the American affiliate of the international federation. Insisted on Seating **********It was Mr. Bernstein and Helsinki Watch's executive director, Jeri Laber, among other members of the delegation, who insisted that Mr. Timofeyev be seated at the table. **********Talking of his colleagues, Mr. Timofeyev said: ''Wherever we are, we are always concerned by the fate of our friends who remain in camp and whose crime is saying some of the same things that the esteemed people here are saying. **********''They just said it at the wrong time - five years ago.'' **********One of the delegates from the Helsinki Federation gave the number of such prisoners as 360, and said that 329 had been released in the last year, which was marked by two decrees implementing the release of scores of prisoners and a more recent amnesty. **********But the Westerners did not have a monopoly on strong statements about the risky situation of civic rights in the Soviet Union. Argument of Member **********Mikhail A. Krutolov, a member of the official Soviet commission, argued forcefully for legal changes and institutional guarantees against abuse ''so that Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, a citizen living 5,000 miles from Moscow, sees that his rights are protected.'' **********''We can talk about individual cases of violations of human rights,'' continued Mr. Krutolov, a professor at Moscow's Institute of State and Law, ''but it is far more essential to see to the establishment of institutions that will guarantee human rights.'' **********As he spoke under the ornately decorated ceiling of the meeting room in an old Central Moscow building, he was watched by a crowd of dissidents, would-be emigrants, staid Soviet reporters, Western reporters and television cameras, and Hare Krishna devotees who passed out nuts and sweets. **********Many among the audience of about 20 people, who had been sitting quietly through the first three hours of discussion, straightened up when Irwin Coutler, a Canadian lawyer who is a member of the Helsinki delegation, made an plea for free emigration and then turned to Mr. Timofeyev and asked him to speak. Chair Gives In to Demands **********When Mr. Burlatsky and his colleagues objected, saying that the chairman's rights were being usurped and that they had not heard of Mr. Timofeyev's group, Ms. Laber answered, ''You're sitting with our group, and they are a part of us.'' **********Shortly thereafter, Mr. Burlatsky gave in, saying the Westerners had achieved their aim but that ''this was the worst possible way'' to do so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/20/world/an-unsparing-view-of-economic-ills.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Steinfels", "pub_date": "1988-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Unsparing View of Economic Ills", "print_headline": "An Unsparing View of Economic Ills", "body_text": " **********Theologians scrutinize papal encyclicals the way constitutional lawyers pore over Supreme Court decisions, looking for subtle shifts in phrasing, new lines of argument, discreet silences about past statements that are now better forgotten. Pope John Paul II's **********''Sollicitudo Rei Socialis'' (''The Social Concerns of the Church'') will keep the theologians very busy in the next week. **********Their first impression undoubtedly will be one of strong continuity between this encyclical letter and the one it is meant to commemorate, Pope Paul VI's ''Populorum Progressio'' (''On the Development of Peoples''), issued two decades ago. But the encyclical also contains some striking new ideas that are certain to provoke debate. **********The continuity is not surprising: Popes seldom do things by leaps and bounds. John Paul, moreover, insists that one of his chief aims in this encyclical is to demonstrate that the church's social teaching is both constant in its fundamental principles and responsive to changing circumstances. **********On the other hand, reasserting the main themes of Pope Paul's encyclical is noteworthy. Paul's encyclical, after all, was one of the more controversial of papal encyclicals. The Wall Street Journal called it ''warmed-over Marxism.'' Catholic scholars and social critics of a radical bent hailed it for its sweeping criticisms of the profit motive, free trade and existing structures of international capitalism. **********In the radical view, Pope Paul's encyclical took a decisive step in emphasizing the need for a change in economic institutions, rather than simply in moral attitudes toward the poor. It even contained a passage - very carefully qualified - that could be read as justification for violent revolution under extreme circumstances. Categorizing Pope Isn't Easy **********Although a defender of capitalist institutions like the theologian Michael Novak, who is affliliated with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, argues that the radical interpretation was overstated, he, too, acknowledges that Paul's encyclical was bitter medicine and, in his view, the wrong prescription. Pope Paul, Mr. Novak wrote in 1984, wavered ''between pessimism and utopian hope,'' and compared with Pope John XXIII, Paul was ''dour.'' Mr. Novak looked to John Paul II to restore the balance. **********Once again, however, the current Pope seems to have escaped easy categorization. Certainly the tone of his encyclical is as urgent and as critical as Paul's. John Paul even hints that the earlier encyclical might have been overly optimistic. **********The Pope's view of the economic scene is unsparing. He emphasizes the desperation in poor nations but does not stop there, suggesting that the problems of homelessness and unemployment reveal that things go badly even in the heart of affluent societies. A Severity of Tone **********John Paul's encyclical is no less direct than Paul VI's in blaming economic structures - it calls them ''economic, financial and social mechanisms'' that ''often function almost automatically'' to benefit the powerful and impoverish others. **********That the Pope insists on explicitly religious language, referring to ''sin'' and ''structures of sin,'' reinforces the severity of tone. **********At the same time, the new encyclical contains ideas that are sharp departures from Paul's encyclical. **********One of them is the Pope's description of how the East-West conflict distorts economic development. The Pope matter-of-factly describes this division of the world into blocs, without taking sides, and criticizes ''liberal capitalism'' and ''Marxist collectivism'' in parallel fashion. **********If John Paul did not have a long history of opposing Communism, reflected in this encyclical in many references to human rights, his passage on the East-West struggle would possibly expose him to charges of ''moral equivalence'' - equating Communist and Western societies. **********In fact, Pope Paul, 20 years ago, may have put the onus for economic underdevelopment on the West more fully than does John Paul. Paul's encyclical emphasized the imbalance between rich and poor nations, and its effect on international trade. In that sense, the new document is less ''populist'' and more ''geopolitical'' than the old one. 'Right of Economic Initiative' **********Another striking notion is John Paul's affirmation of ''the right of economic initiative.'' While the traditional defense of the right of private property has been highly modified in modern papal documents to take account of social responsibilities, ''the right of economic initiative'' indicates a new awareness that inventive or entrepreneurial energies can be smothered by bureaucratic control or rigid egalitarianism. **********The encyclical also mentions the responsibility of the developing nations to take initiatives, ''not expecting everything from the more favored countries,'' and to replace dictatorial forms of government with democratic ones. Such passages seem to express dissatisfaction with polemical claims against the West and with statist development strategies in the developing nations. **********Finally, the new encyclical is characteristic of the present Pope in its distinct theological tone. Since the Second Vatican Council, Catholic statements on social issues have become less strictly philosophical, more explicitly biblical and theological. The trend has accelerated during this pontificate. **********The Book of Genesis, redemption in Christ, the Fathers of the Church, the life of the Trinity, the Eucharist - all become elements of John Paul's reflections on economic development in a way much more theologically suggestive than the more straightforward and philosophical statement of Pope Paul."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/08/world/sihanouk-determined-to-gain-cambodia-accord.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sihanouk 'Determined' to Gain Cambodia Accord", "print_headline": "Sihanouk 'Determined' to Gain Cambodia Accord", "body_text": " **********Prince Norodom Sihanouk intends to negotiate a political settlement with the Vietnamese-backed Government in Cambodia with or without the backing of his coalition partners or foreign allies, the Prince's son and spokesman said today. **********''This time, my father is completely determined to go right to the end,'' Prince Norodom Ranariddh said in an interview at his Bangkok residence, from which he directs the Sihanoukist National Army and its political organization. **********Today, on the ninth anniversary of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk was in France preparing for a second meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen, tentatively set for Jan. 20. His coalition partners, Son Sann of the non-Communist Khmer Peoples National Liberation Front, and Khieu Samphan, representing the Khmer Rouge, have not yet agreed to attend. **********Asian officials and diplomats are beginning to acknowledge, after initial doubts, that Prince Sihanouk, a dominant political figure in Cambodia since the end of World War II, may have chosen an opportune moment for such a move. **********After meeting with Mr. Hun Sen in Fere-en-Tardenois, France, last month, the Prince had several changes of mind about whether to continue the talks, At one point he appeared to cancel the next session in France, saying he would meet the Prime Minister only in Pyongyang, North Korea, where the Prince has a home. The War Slows Down **********Intelligence reports, confirmed in part by recent visits to Cambodia by Western reporters, say the war there has ground to an eerie silence. The Vietnamese, almost totally preoccupied by crippling economic problems at home, have admitted they are fighting a tough psychological battle for the hearts and minds of Cambodians, who bear them a traditional distrust. **********''The Vietnamese are facing health, morale and logistics problems,'' said Prince Ranariddh, who spends part of his time on the Thai-Cambodian border with Prince Sihanouk's 18,000 troops. ''We need to offer Vietnam a way out with dignity.'' **********Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces are larger, numbering about 30,000, but are reported to be in some disarray, rent by internal disagreements among the next generation of commanders. The Khmer Front is estimated to have 7,000 to 8,000 fighters. **********Prince Ranariddh said today that he had spoken to Khmer Rouge regimental commanders who are on the verge of refusing to fight under Ta Mok, one of the guerrilla leaders thought to be positioning himself to take Pol Pot's mantle. **********Prince Ranariddh also said that Son Sen, the nominal Khmer Rouge military leader, has been unable since last April to mount a serious attack inside Cambodia. Southeast Asian officials say the Khmer Rouge have become less of a military force and are concentrating on infiltration and subterfuge.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, to withdraw from politics and allow an elected civilian government to take power, State Department and senior Latin American diplomats said Thursday night. **********The Pentagon official, Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, reportedly spent the afternoon of Dec. 30 meeting with General Noriega. **********''Noriega listened very carefully and he said he got the message very clearly,'' said a senior Latin American diplomat familiar with the mission. Strains in Relations **********The diplomat made it clear that General Noriega did not reject Mr. Armitage's message out of hand. But it was not known whether he indicated he would consider the idea. A call to the Panamanian Embassy for comment went unanswered late Thursday night. **********Relations between the United States and Panama have deterioriated over the last year amid charges of military corruption and what American officials have termed a courting of the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Armitage was accompanied by Robert Pastorino, another Pentagon official. Mr. Armitage, Mr. Pastorino, and the American Ambassador, Arthur Davis, spent the entire afternoon of Dec. 30 with General Noriega, who excluded other members of the Panamanian armed forces from the meeting. Resignation by April **********The officials called for General Noriega to step down as head of the national defense forces by April, to allow at least one year for Panama to prepare for a fair election. The vote is scheduled for May 1989. **********The officials also stressed that the United States supports a Panamanian solution and had no intention of interfering in Panama's internal affairs. **********''They just asked Noriega to step down, to make an honorable exit,'' said a senior Latin American diplomat. **********After the meeting General Noriega told his closest advisers that the United States had sent a high-level delegation to warn him of an impending military coup, according to Latin American diplomats. It was this conversation, these diplomats speculated, that prompted Administration officials to disclose the trip by Mr. Armitage. **********The general ''was bragging to the military about how important his visitors were,'' said one Latin American diplomat. **********Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Mr. Armitage repeated to General Noriega the Administration's position that the Panamanian military ''must step back and let civilian government come forward.'' **********Administration officials said that Mr. Armitage was chosen for the mission because it was thought that the general would be more comfortable dealing with the Defense Department. 'A Heart-to-Heart Talk' **********''We thought it was time to have a heart-to-heart talk with him,'' an official said, ''and Armitage was the most credible guy to go down.'' **********Last summer, demonstrators damaged the United States Embassy in Panama, and Washington charged that they were provoked by the Panamanian Government, which had just ended a state of emergency. **********General Noriega has long been suspected of involvement in drug trafficking and after his former chief of staff, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, asserted that the general had a hand in political assassinations, the United States noticeably began distancing itself. **********More recently, General Noriega has made efforts to irritate the United States, officials in Washington said, particularly by granting the Soviet airline Aeroflot landing rights and allowing Soviet ships to use drydocks. General Noriega is also said to be developing ties to Salvadoran guerrilla groups. **********Last month officials reported a consensus at the Pentagon, State Department and Central Intelligence Agency that General Noriega should go. **********One Latin American diplomat said the purpose of the Armitage visit ''was similar to that of Paul Laxalt in the Philippines,'' referring to the trip in October 1985 by Mr. Laxalt, a confidant of President Reagan who was then a senator from Nevada. He was reported to have advised President Ferdinand E. Marcos to yield power to an elected successor.

Standard & Poor's index for this group showed price gains of 67 percent in 1985, 52 percent in 1986 and 28 percent in 1987, compared with gains of 26 percent, 14 percent and 2 percent in the S.&P. 500-stock index. **********Through last Wednesday's market close, the pollution control group is down 6.5 percent so far this year, while the ''500'' is ahead 4.9 percent. But a number of analysts continue to recommend the group strongly, even as others advise a degree of caution. **********''Investing in pollution control stocks is not without risk,'' Paul L. Huberman commented recently in Standard & Poor's Outlook. ''A possible de-emphasis of environmental issues by the public could curtail enforcement efforts. Also, the Justice Department is continuing to investigate allegations of price fixing and bid rigging in the trash hauling industry.'' **********Moreover, dividend yields of pollution control issues are low, while their price/earnings ratios command a substantial premium. Weighing the risks and rewards, Mr. Huberman believes the group will continue to outperform the market. **********William Genco, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, carries a ''buy'' rating on Waste Management, Chemical Waste Management, Browning-Ferris Industries and Rollins Environmental Services. **********Jeffrey Klein and Marc H. Sulam of Kidder, Peabody & Company recommend Waste Management and Browning-Ferris as ''aggressive purchases.'' Vishnu Swarup of Prudential-Bache Securities has taken a more cautious stance, since he believes the heady growth rate in profits will slow somewhat in the years ahead. Accordingly, he downgraded Waste Management, Chemical Waste Management and Rollins from ''aggressive purchase'' to ''accumulate.'' **********''Between 10 percent and 20 percent of earnings growth for the typical pollution control stock will have come from lower tax rates in 1987 and 1988,'' Mr. Swarup said. ''In 1989, however, rates should stabilize and, in some cases, increase.'' **********He also foresees some ''modest margin erosion'' for Waste Management and Browning-Ferris. Both have expanded partly by acquiring companies with lower profit margins. Browning-Ferris is rated as an ''average performer'' over the next six months. **********''Because of expiring investment tax credits in 1988, Browning-Ferris will have a slightly higher effective tax rate for its fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989, than for the previous fiscal year,'' he said. **********Waste Management is the nation's largest provider of comprehensive waste management services. The company derives most of its earnings from solid waste services, but it is also an important factor in hazardous waste. **********''We expect earnings to grow about 20 percent annually over the next three to five years,'' Mr. Swarup said. **********Waste Management reported 1987 earnings of $1.46 a share, compared with $1.76 the previous year. However, the 1986 figure includes nonrecurring items totaling 71 cents a share. **********Both Standard & Poor's and Prudential-Bache estimate earnings for this year at $1.90 a share. Mr. Genco of Merrill Lynch projects earnings at $1.95 a share for 1988 and at $2.35 next year. **********In yesterday's trading, Waste Management closed at $35.75, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Over the last 52 weeks, its price has ranged between $48.50 and $28. Adjusted for splits, the stock sold as low as $1 in 1977. **********Chemical Waste Management, 81 percent owned by Waste Management, is the largest company providing comprehensive hazardous waste management services in the United States. It earned 87 cents a share last year, and most estimates call for about $1.20 in 1988. The stock finished at $25.375 yesterday, up 37.5 cents. **********Browning-Ferris derives virtually all its profits from solid waste services. In the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, it earned $1.15 a share. Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company carries the stock on its recommended list. **********Both Smith Barney and Kidder, Peabody project earnings at $1.50 a share for the year ending Sept. 30, 1988, and at $1.80 for the following fiscal year. Yesterday the Browning-Ferris shares advanced $1, to $27. **********''Rollins Environmental is my No. 1 pick in the group,'' Mr. Huberman said. He estimates earnings at 95 cents a share for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1988, up from 60 cents the previous fiscal year. The stock closed yesterday at $22, a gain of 12.5 cents. **********Shortly before the October market plunge, it traded at a record price of $25.875 - up from $1.50 in 1984, adjusted for splits. The company derives about 70 percent of its revenues from the operation of three high-temperature incinerators that destroy a variety of organic hazardous wastes. **********The pollution control group is susceptible at times to bursts of overenthusiasm. As an example, analysts cite Ecology and Environment Inc., an environmental consulting and testing concern for the waste industry. It went public last March at $15, immediately ran up to $29.875 and dropped to $8.50 after the October collapse.

Russell Stravitz  Executive vice president, Bloomingdale's. **********I'm neutral or cautiously positive on fall. We've all come through a difficult year. The change in skirt lengths was not well accepted. Prices began rising in the spring of 1987 and merchandise inflation is still a factor. Then the stock market crashed. Maybe we all missed what the customer really wanted - clothes to go to work in; the short skirt didn't serve her needs.

But for Linh Ho, a 45-year-old veteran of the South Vietnamese Air Force, such perils are to be taken in stride, whether they are encountered here in the Canadian Arctic or in the Pleiku Highlands of Vietnam. **********Among the chopper pilots who work in the high Arctic, with its daily challenge of frigid temperatures and plunging fjords and compasses that cease to work near the magnetic North Pole, Mr. Linh is considered without peer. But to the Vietnamese-born pilot, who flew his family onto the deck of a United States Navy ship only hours before Communist forces took Saigon in 1975, the Arctic has nothing to daunt him after five years of combat and being shot down in Vietnam. **********''Every pilot has his skills,'' he said at the close of a day that had seen him at work for a dozen hours, ferrying scientists and their gear between remote camps in Canada's Arctic islands, where winter blizzards begin moving in by mid-August. He added: ''My specialty is mountains, bad weather and landing on the water. Many pilots who flew in Vietnam can handle this easily. It is what we were trained for in the war.'' **********This year, as for eight years past, Mr. Linh was among the few hundred men and women who use the brief season when the Arctic emerges from permanent night to build a future in one of the world's last frontiers. Taking on the Arctic Alone **********Every now and then, there is a romantic who takes on the Arctic wastes alone. Dr. Russell Marris, a 55-year-old British surgeon, spends his summers indulging a passion for Arctic plants and flowers. For 15 of the last 16 summers, and on and off since 1952, he has trekked alone across the Arctic terrain for weeks at a time, looking for such exotic fauna as Hooker's rock cress and the Arctic chockweed. **********In place of the parka and wind pants of most Arctic explorers, he wears a threadbare woolen shirt and the kind of windbreaker favored by British golfers, with boots torn along one seam, no watch, no high-frequency radio and no firearm to ward off polar bears. But like Mr. Linh, he finds little about his exploits surprising. **********''Am I unusual? Oh, I don't think so,'' he said at the support camp the Canadian Government's Polar Continental Shelf Project runs for scientists at Resolute Bay. ''I mean, there's a Norwegian chap in Greenland who traps foxes, and I believe he goes two years without seeing anybody.'' **********This summer, as he has for the last six years, Dr. Marris hitchhiked to Ellesmere aboard a polar shelf aircraft and disappeared into the interior, near the joint United States-Canadian military base at Alert, remaining there for three weeks before thumbing a ride back to Resolute on another Government-chartered plane. In his backpack, he carried a small stove, dehydrated food, a diary, a camera, a sleeping bag and a tent. The backpack had no room for a change of clothing, but Dr. Marris always wore his tie, albeit loosened at the neck. Eccentricity Disavowed **********When an acquaintance inquired whether he considered himself part of the tradition of British eccentrics, he looked puzzled. **********''We had an American chap over in Edinburgh studying eccentrics once,'' he said. ''But I never actually saw the TV program on it, so I don't know what he decided.'' **********Since graduating from Cambridge University, Dr. Marris has had a transient medical career in Britain, interspersing stints as a gynecologist, pathologist and surgeon with forays to the Arctic, on which he has written widely for European scientific journals. In the north, when a scientist was badly hurt in a fall, Dr. Marris was hauled in to patch him up before he was flown south to a hospital. At other times, the doctor has earned lodging by painting cabins. **********Mr. Linh, now a pilot earning as much as $5,000 a month, has come a long way since his days as a $40-a-month pilot in South Vietnam. In 1978, after working as a laborer and accountant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he re-qualified as a helicopter pilot, and he has spent summers in the north ever since. Instead of the 110-degree temperatures of the Mekong Delta summer, he is flying sorties in temperatures of 50 degrees below zero. **********The scientists regard him with something close to awe. ''He'll go where other pilots won't even try,'' said Jon Devaney, a 28-year-old geologist from Ottawa who spent part of the summer skipping across Ellesmere Island in Mr. Linh's Bell Jet Ranger. ''You only have to point, and he'll head there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/26/business/advertising-cowles-media-unit-to-buy-bowhunter.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cowles Media Unit To Buy Bowhunter", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Cowles Media Unit To Buy Bowhunter", "body_text": " **********Blue-Jay Inc. of Fort Wayne, Ind., the publisher of Bowhunter magazine, is on the verge of being acquired by Historical Times of Harrisburg, Pa., a subsidiary of the Cowles Media Company.

Last year, she estimated, her company spent almost $40 million on medical expenses for its employees, up 14 percent in one year and more than double its spending five years ago. ''The costs are just getting crazier,'' she said. **********Companies everywhere are faced with the same problem. But Southern New England Telecommunications developed a cost-containment approach that is somewhat unusual, and it is now being watched with interest by companies across the country. **********According to Ms. Kardos, the only way her company could bring medical costs into line was to try to control doctor bills. The best way to do that, she concluded, was to develop an in-house physician network. Under the company's new plan, which went into effect Jan. 1, doctors agree to accept lower fees in the anticipation of a higher volume of business from the company's 14,000 employees. **********But the plan, called ''Health Connection,'' has caused an uproar among groups as diverse as union members and doctors. Union members struck the company in 1986, protesting wage proposals and changes in medical benefits. And the plan has also come under attack from several groups of Connecticut doctors, who argue that medicine should be left to the people who specialize in it. **********''Managed care is an enormously difficult business,'' said Mickey Herbert, president of Physicians Health Services Inc., the largest health maintenance organization in Connecticut, with more than 90,000 members. He argued that Southern New England Telecommunications should stay in the communications business and out of medicine. ''They are getting into a business that is entirely new to them and I have some healthy skepticism as to their success in it,'' he said. ''Employers just can't leap out with delivery systems.'' **********For the New Haven-based telephone company - and other corporations watching it - the reasons for getting into that business are compelling. According to the health affairs division of Project Hope, which monitors public and private health care in America, corporations spent more than $110 billion last year on medical expenses. **********And those costs are expected to keep rising. In 1988, insurance industry executives say, health insurance premiums for corporations will increase 10 and 70 percent. ''There is going to be a lot of pressure from a lot of companies to find out what is going on with health care,'' said Gail Wilensky, vice president of Project Hope's health affairs division. ''The sleeping giant is waking up.'' **********To try to contain its costs, Southern New England Telecommunications recruited 450 of the state's 5,000 licensed physicians into the plan and said it would add no more than 50 other doctors; that, according to Ms. Kardos, will allow the company to monitor quality and care. The doctors agreed to accept rates, set by the company, that are about 20 percent below their standard fees; in return, they get a chance to tap into the 14,000-employee work force. **********After paying a deductible - $150 for an individual and $300 for a family - employees who use doctors in the network pay nothing more for doctor visits and prescription medicine; the company pays those charges. Because the company is prohibited by law from directly negotiating with hospitals for lower rates, hospital expenses did not change. **********For employees who opt for the network, the plan could mean that they would have to leave doctors they have seen for years if those doctors do not join. Employees still have the option of choosing alternative care systems, such as the health-maintenance organizations or the company's traditional medical plan, but those choices could be costly. If an employee, for example, signs up for a health-maintenance organization instead of the network, he or she will be charged as much as $900 more each year. **********SO the incentive to join is great. Ms. Kardos believes 25 percent of the work force will use the network initially, rising to one-third by year-end. She estimates the network will allow the company to freeze its 1988 health care expenses at last year's level of $39.5 million, and, she said, ''If all goes well, we might even lower our costs.'' **********Her company is not alone in attempting innovative programs. In Milwaukee, the municipal government, Miller Brewing, Allis-Chalmers and five other companies joined forces a year ago to create the Health Care Network of Greater Milwaukee, which has contracted with 13 hospitals and almost half the estimated 3,600 physicians in the area. Richard Wagner, the network's executive director, estimated the plan will save employers 20 percent in hospital costs and about 14 percent in physicians' payments. **********Ms. Wilensky of Project Hope said more companies in the next several years will adopt in-house physician networks. General Motors, Xerox, United Technologies and hundreds of others are now reviewing the feasibility of establishing such plans. The physician networks will become more popular, Ms. Wilensky said, because insurance companies and health maintenance organizations are not doing a good enough job of stabilizing costs, especially in outpatient care. ''There are no incentives for a doctor to be cost-conscious in an outpatient setting,'' she said. **********The incentives are clear for companies, however. General Motors, for example, said it must add an estimated $500 to the sticker price of every car and truck it sells to cover employee health care costs. ''We want to change doctor patterns and get better utilization from them,'' says Beach Hall, G.M.'s assistant director of health care benefits. ''There is a lot of fat we have to take care of.'' But cutting fat is often easier said than done. The criticism that exploded when Southern New England Telecommunications's plan was announced has subsided a bit among union leaders, but doctors remain perturbed. In 1986, the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers staged a two-month strike to protest a wage plan and to fight the proposed network. When the company refused to bargain, the union was forced to accept the network as part of a new contract, George M. Sherwood, union president, said. **********THE doctors, by contrast, were not so accommodating. Fearful of losing control of their practices, they are trying to ward off the plan and others like it. Last year, 1,600 Connecticut doctors contributed $3,000 to $4,000 each to create a health-maintenance organization to be offered to employees at the telephone company and other companies in the state. The doctors have also formed the Physicians Association of New Haven County, whose acronym is pronounced panic, to provide information about economic conditions for physicians. **********''The acronym sounds like panic because that is how we felt when we created it,'' said Steven Wolfson, a cardiologist and Panhc board member. ''We are concerned that all of these delivery systems are mechanisms to control the patients and physicians.'' **********But Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer-advocate group in Washington, argued that there was nothing wrong with companies trying to lower costs through in-house networks - so long as the quality of care is considered alongside costs. **********''The problem is that a new ethic exists out there to cut costs regardless of its effect on quality,'' he said. ''Many patients are then at the mercy of their employer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/15/business/us-trade-deficit-improves-sharply-as-imports-plunge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IMPROVES SHARPLY AS IMPORTS PLUNGE", "print_headline": "U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IMPROVES SHARPLY AS IMPORTS PLUNGE", "body_text": " **********In a surprisingly favorable development, the nation's trade deficit plunged to $9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly level since late 1984. **********Today's Commerce Department report showed that a sharp decline in imports, to a level not seen since January, accounted for about 95 percent of the overall improvement. Analysts also expressed approval of a slowing of exports during the summer, a trend that tends to reduce the risks of an overly strong economy and severe inflation. **********''We have the best of both worlds,'' said Gary E. Schlossberg, an economist at the Wells Fargo Bank. ''There's lessened concern that the economy is on the verge of overheating.'' Dollar Up Sharply in Trading **********The trade report helped touched off rallies in the stock and bond markets. The dollar also rose sharply, especially in relation to the West German mark, but currency traders said they did not think the spurt indicated a new rally. **********With only one more set of trade figures to come before Election Day, Republicans were elated by the sharp improvement in July. President Reagan called the report ''very good news.'' Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr., traveling in Asia, issued a statement predicting a continuation of ''favorable trends.'' **********In a Democratic response to the report, the Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, made a floor statement acknowledging the ''better'' trade figures. Wary About Total for Year **********But Senator Byrd added, ''Even if we maintain the July pace for the rest of the year, we will have a trade deficit approaching $130 billion.'' This, he said, would be ''like finding that your town is still going to be hit by Hurricane Gilbert but that the winds have dropped to 'only' 150 miles an hour.'' **********Democrats have long complained, among other things, that the United States has been ''exporting'' jobs to its trading partners. A protectionist textile bill that President Reagan says he would veto has been working its way toward passage by Congress. **********In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve said the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased their production a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in August, a gain that was slightly better than expected. **********The narrowing of the trade deficit in July by a seasonally adjusted 27.9 percent was one of the sharpest monthly improvements on record. It followed a major setback in June, which analysts said today was almost certainly an aberration. **********One of the few negative aspects in today's report was a revision for June that widened the deficit for that month still further, to $13.2 billion, from the $12.5 billion originally reported. Most of the revision reflected a reduction of exports. **********For July, imports dropped 8.9 percent from the June level to a total of $36 billion, while exports rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $26.5 billion. **********Although surging exports have been one of the main forces driving the nation's economic expansion in the last two years, economists and others were becoming increasingly worried that the country was growing short of capacity in chemicals, paper, steel and other industries. Continued strong foreign demand, they warned, might threaten hard-won gains against inflation by encouraging manufacturers, struggling to fill big backlogs of orders, to raise prices. Federal Reserve's Rate Policy **********To contain price pressures, the Federal Reserve has been gradually raising interest rates since early spring. This policy, which included an August increase in the central bank's discount rate, seems to be working. Apparently the economy has slowed but has not stopped growing. **********Imports of capital goods declined in July by $1.2 billion, today's report showed, while imports of consumer goods fell $900 million, automotive vehicles, parts and engines fell $800 million and industrial supplies and materials fell $500 million. Americans bought about the same amount of imported foods, beverages and other merchandise in July as in June. **********Exports of capital goods rose $600 million, but this was about offset by a decline in sales of automotive and other products, the Commerce Department said. Exports of consumer goods were virtually unchanged. **********The nation's bill for imported oil eased by $200 million, to $3.4 billion, reflecting the purchase of four million barrels less and an average price decline of 42 cents a barrel. **********Rimmer deVries, chief economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said he was particularly encouraged by the drop in imports because he believes lackluster growth in Europe and Japan would help put an end to the American export boom. Change in Reporting of Data **********Mr. deVries now has ''a hope,'' he added, that the nation's annual trade deficit, which totaled $170 billion last year, could be reduced to perhaps as little as $80 billion, although this is ''still a long haul.'' **********Today's report was the first time in more than a decade that the Commerce Department published its two series of import data - one including freight and insurance and the other without - on the same day. This change, mandated by the comprehensive new trade legislation and long urged by economists, is intended to put exports and imports on the same footing. **********The trade law undid a measure sponsored in the mid-1970's by Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, that barred the Commerce Department from reporting the figures without freight and insurance until 48 hours after it had published the inclusive figures. The aim was to make the trade deficit appear larger, and it largely succeeded because the second set of figures was generally ignored. **********The Reagan Administration supported the move to eliminate this requirement, but it blunted charges of political maneuvering by pointing out that the change was included in the 1988 bill throughout its long journey through Congress. **********Calculated on the new basis, which will become standard beginning with the trade report for next January, the July trade deficit was $8.1 billion, compared with $11.7 billion in June. Further Adjustment Planned **********The Commerce Department said today that, beginning early next year, it would also provide import and export data in constant dollars as well as in the current dollars now reported. By eliminating the effect of inflation, this will produce a more accurate measure of trade volumes and their effect on economic activity, it said. **********This summer the department resumed the practice of adjusting the trade totals for seasonal variation, which had been suspended for about two years because data-collection backlogs had made this approach meaningless. **********By countries and geographical regions, which remain only in adjusted form, the July figures show relatively little shift. The United States deficit in trade with Japan remained at about $4.4 billion, and imports of Japanese cars climbed about $100 million, to $1.7 billion. **********The deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner, remained at about $1.1 billion, and the deficit with newly industrialized countries, including South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, remained at about $2.7 billion. **********The trade deficit with Western Europe, however, climbed to $2.3 billion, from $1.9 billion, while the deficit with Mexico shrank to $75 million, from $400 million, and the deficit with Brazil slipped to $410 million, from $490 million. **********This nation's surplus in agricultural trade shrank to $885 million, from $928 million, as the manufacturing deficit narrowed to $12.8 billion, from $13.6 billion, the Commerce Department said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/16/world/us-finds-2-mines-where-ship-was-damaged.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1988-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 471, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Finds 2 Mines Where Ship Was Damaged", "print_headline": "U.S. Finds 2 Mines Where Ship Was Damaged", "body_text": " **********The United States Navy destroyed two mines in the Persian Gulf today at the spot where an explosion damaged an American warship on Thursday, and Pentagon officials asserted that the mines were put there recently by Iran. **********Pentagon officials said that lookouts on the frigate that was damaged, the Samuel B.

So some analysts contend that despite a rise of about $6 in the last two weeks, its stock is undervalued. Dow's shares closed at $89.875 yesterday, off 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Analysts say Dow's stock is underpriced because investors have an automatic aversion to a company in a cyclical industry that is now at a peak, even though they say Dow will probably sail through the next recession, whenever it comes, without much difficulty. **********''The market is afraid of 1989, and people don't understand chemicals,'' said Mary O'Neill, a chemical industry analyst for Duff & Phelps. And Leslie C. Ravitz, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, said investors were too scared by the threat of another recession to notice a bargain. ''Investors don't see what's in front of their faces but are saying, 'What about tomorrow?' It's the classic mistake in a bear market.'' **********James H. Wilbur of Smith Barney, Harris Upham said many investors realized that Dow Chemical's 32 percent return on investment was the product of peaking demand for chemicals and therefore could not go on forever. But he added that they did not appreciate that the company's diversification drive had improved its long-term prospects. ''We've had it as a recommendation for the past two years,'' he said. **********Dow, like most other chemical companies, has benefited from the record demand for commodity chemicals, like chlorine and polyethylene, which are highly price-sensitive. And when capacity is tight, as it is right now, prices rise an inch but net income rises a yard. Part of the recent increase in demand is domestic, but most of it stems from exports, which are soaring at the expense of European competitors because the weakened dollar has made American goods cheaper in world markets. **********''Dow's doing even better than the industry,'' said John Henry, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. ''They're having record revenues and earnings, and the highest operating rates in history. Exports are booming. They've been increasing their earnings estimates all year long. They should substantially outperform the market. I rate it an aggressive buy.'' **********Analysts like the balance Dow has built into its business since the 1982 recession, both in the products it sells and the countries in which it makes them. The company has nearly achieved its goal of getting half its revenue from specialty chemicals and plastics, highly differentiated products whose prices, unlike those of commodities, do not suffer in a slump. These products range from familiar supermarket goods, like Saran Wrap, Fantastik and Ziploc plastic food bags, to Dursban, an anti-termite chemical that has done well since a competitor was pulled off the market, and Seldane, a new anti-allergy drug that Dow said brought revenues of $240 million last year. **********Dow continues to invest disproportionately in specialty products, but the current boom in commodities is interrupting the relative growth in their importance to the bottom line. In 1987, specialties accounted for 34 percent of operating income, down 13 percentage points from the year before. **********The company, based in Midland, Mich., has moved much of its manufacturing overseas, allowing it to supply customers from whichever source is cheapest at the time, taking into account transportation costs and exchange rates. It now gets 55 percent of its revenue from overseas operations, which helps cushion it against a domestic downturn while giving its foreign-currency profits a ride on the dollar. **********''Our historical growth rate, from 1975 to 1987, was 9.5 percent,'' said Sara Opperman, a spokeswoman for Dow. ''We expect that to rise to 10.5 percent for the next seven years.'' She said that, figuring an inflation rate of 5 percent, Dow's annual revenues should reach $30 billion by 1995, more than twice the $13.4 billion of 1987, barring any major acquisitions. Dow made its last acquisition in September, when it bought Lamaur Inc., a shampoo company, for $174 million. **********Ted Semagran, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said he expected Dow's revenues to rise about 18 percent this year, with volume up 4 percent and prices up 13 percent. He said Dow had predicted only a 10 percent average price increase for its commodity chemicals, but that this had to be upgraded after last month's explosion of a Shell Oil refinery in Louisiana, which hobbled a nearby ethylene plant. Ethylene, a building block of plastic, is one of Dow's staples, and since the plant was producing at nearly 100 percent capacity before the explosion, ethylene is now in such short supply that prices have jumped enormously, Mr. Semagran said. **********He added that nothing but the deepest recession could strain Dow's bottom line because much of the demand for its exports seems solid. ''Far Eastern nations, especially China, have been very, very large importers of U.S. chemical products, and if you don't have a slowdown there, a recession here might not even be noticeable'' to Dow, he said. **********The analysts agreed that 1988 earnings would be $11 to $12.75 a share, compared with $6.47 in 1987. However, they diverged on 1989 earnings according to their expectations of recession. Ms. O'Neill of Duff & Phelps expects one of the quarters in 1989 to register negative growth and predicts $8.75 a share for the year, the lowest of the group; Mr. Ravitz of Salomon expects $15 a share without a recession, the highest. ''It will be closer to $13 if there's a nominal recession,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-auto-projects-offer-sharp-contrasts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 715, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Auto Projects Offer Sharp Contrasts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Auto Projects Offer Sharp Contrasts", "body_text": " **********AS far as introductory automotive advertising goes, yesterday morning provided a vivid study in contrasts. Class and mass. Toys for those who have attained and for those still reaching. **********In a one-on-one meeting at his agency, Della Femina McNamee WCRS, Robert R. Wharen, vice president, marketing, of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, displayed the single print ad that will introduce the new $145,000 Bentley Turbo R as the ''the quintessential power trip.'' Fourth-quarter advertising spending will approach $2 million, which the company hopes will lead to the sale of all 140 cars that the parent company in Britain will produce in this model year. **********Later yesterday morning General Motors' Oldsmobile division, at a full-scale news briefing at the Grand Hyatt, previewed 11 television commercials and 30 variations of 14 print ads that will introduce its 10 models priced at $10,000 to $26,000. It expects to sell more than 735,000 of them. Olds traditionally does not release advertising budget figures, but Leading National Advertisers tracked $56.2 million spent by it in 1987. **********The Bentley Turbo R is the first Bentley that will cost more than a Rolls. The bottom of the Rolls line costs slightly less than this Bentley, but the top, the Corniche II convertible, still is way up there at $199,000. **********Before 1985 the Bentley differed little from the Rolls outwardly except it didn't have the Flying Lady or the grill work, but rather had a winged B as a hood ornament. It cost about $1,000 less than the cheapest Rolls. **********It was, Mr. Wharen said, ''for people who didn't want to be seen in a Rolls-Royce, which they considered an outward symbol of a success they didn't want to espouse.'' **********New management decided in 1985 to introduce a new Bentley to attract the sporty types that buy certain Mercedes, BMW's, Jaguars, Lamborghinis and Porsches. **********It was intended, Mr. Wharen said, to appeal to successful people who have not yet reached the heights of their careers. **********The first new model was the Bentley 8 for a mere $89,000. **********In October 1987, the company introduced the Bentley Mulsanne S for $107,000. It expects to sell 130 in its first model year. **********With the Bentley Turbo R, Rolls-Royce for the first time will supply its 62 North American dealers with separate Bentley merchandising material. It will also be the first time that the company will advertise in car buff magazines, running its spreads in both Automobile and Road & Track. **********The rest of the media schedule will include a number of business and news publications - The New Yorker, Travel & Leisure, a new publication called Fame and, of course, a couple of magazines for physicians. **********Oldsmobile's television advertising breaks next Thursday during the NBC-TV coverage of the Summer Olympics, and the print will make its debut with a first-of-a-kind eight-page insert in Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and People. **********The theme, from the Leo Burnett Company, Chicago, is ''Introducing the new generation of Olds.'' And for the TV facet the company has obtained the services of celebrities and their kin that best reflect the qualities of the particular model. **********They are the astronaut Scott Carpenter and his son Jay, the actor William Shatner and his daughter Melanie, Abigail Rockwell, the artist's granddaughter; the racing driver Gary Bettenhausen and son Cary; the jazz man Dave Brubeck and his sons Chris and David; Naomi Judd and her daughter Wynonna, who are the Judds of country music, and Roger Moore's daughter Deborah. **********According to Theodore Bell, president and creative director of the Burnett domestic operation, it has been only four and a half months since the agency and client met to get the huge campaign started. To accomplish the job, he said, it took the supervision of six creative directors, seven agency producers and five directors. At one point, he noted, there were five different crews on location from Maine to the Mojave to Hawaii.

In the investor's mind, this has made companies appear vulnerable.  Jeremy J. Siegel  Professor of finance at the Wharton School. **********There has been overreaction in the markets. The senior debt of high-grade companies is a good buy - a very good buy for the long term. And, over the long term, I don't think the volatility in the bond market will continue. **********The drop in the value of bonds is a measure of the fear investors have of corporate bankruptcies. If a company wants to float debt, it may not be easy. **********Pension funds are worried even about holding the bonds of high- grade companies.

Friedman  Professor of economics, Harvard University, and author of ''Day of Reckoning: The Consequences of American Economic Policy under Reagan and After.'' **********If we don't have a recession, we're okay. But if we have a recession and corporate earnings shrink, many borrowers in the bond market will have trouble meeting their obligations and we'll have defaults like we've had at no other time. My sense is that if we have a serious recession to impair growth, then we will be in serious trouble. **********Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is aware of this. The problem is, the overleveraging of our companies will serve as a constraining factor and prevent Greenspan from tightening money next time he has to put the brakes on to slow the economy. This means he will have to adopt a 'no recession' policy and that means inflation. Unlike people in the market who just focus on corporate bonds, I am also worried about Government debt. Because of the overleveraging of companies - and the 'no recession' policy of the Fed - all fixed-income investments will suffer.

And the grisly murders at two funeral processions that were led by the outlawed Irish Republican Army underscored the province's reputation as a place to avoid. **********Yet more than two dozen American companies have generally found another Northern Ireland altogether. They have found an ample pool of skilled workers and a cooperative government, which offers one of the most open-handed incentive programs in the world, including financial assistance for plants, machinery, research facilities and training programs. **********American companies in the troubled British province make everything from cigarettes to computer software. They are important to Northern Ireland's economy, employing 11,000 people, or 11 percent of the industrial work force. To be sure, new investments by American companies have been rare in the past few years, although a Texas-based producer of electronic sensor devices, Neotech, has recently announced plans to build an $8 million factory employing 200 people in the province. Why Companies Stay **********The companies have invested more than $60 million annually during the past three years to expand their operations. Why these companies remain in spite of Northern Ireland's political troubles and how they prosper commercially is perhaps most graphically illustrated by the experience of the AVX Corporation of Great Neck, L.I. The producer of specialized electronic components has found that it can compete against its aggressive Japanese competitors, even shipping to Pacific Rim nations, from its big Northern Ireland operation based in Coleraine, the northernmost port in the province. **********When the company first began production here in 1979, Marshall Butler, the AVX chairman, was so concerned that political troubles might disrupt operations that he had the components shipped daily to a warehouse outside London, where they were stored. Five years ago, the warehouse in England was sold. **********''We've lost more days from snow at our plant in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where it almost never snows, than we have lost from troubles in Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Butler said in a telephone interview. Company's Expansion Plans **********Today, AVX is one of Northern Ireland's leading foreign employers with 1,210 workers. It now has three plants in the province, two of which were added in the past three years as part of a $20 million investment program. Last year, the company decided to buy its facilites here instead of continuing to rent them - evidence of a long-term commitment to Northern Ireland. The local operations are currently in the midst of a drive to sharply increase production. And Mr. Butler says he plans to make another investment in the province to make a new product next year. **********Because of the impressive performance, the Northern Ireland subsidiary has become the hub of AVX's European business, which includes operations in West Germany and France. In fact, cost-cutting machinery and product modifications developed in Northern Ireland have been transferred to AVX facilities worldwide. **********European sales account for about a quarter of AVX's overall revenues, which are estimated at more than $400 million this year. Though competition from Japan is getting stiffer, AVX is regarded as the world's leading maker of multilayer ceramic capacitors. Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors **********Ceramic capacitors are tiny electrical storage devices used in the electronics industry, regulating and filtering the flow of electricity to sensitive integrated circuits. An industry rule-of-thumb is that five or more multilayer ceramic capacitors are sold for every integrated circuit. In Northern Ireland alone, AVX makes about 10 million multilayer ceramic capacitors a year. **********Mr. Butler says he initially chose Northern Ireland for investment because of its combination of financial incentives and an educated work force, supplied by several technical schools and two universities. ''You're not going to compete with Japan on quality and service without educated workers,'' he said. **********The financial inducements are considerable. These include government grants for capital spending of up to 50 percent of total costs, exemption from property taxes, tax write-offs for machinery and construction costs, factory rent subsidies of up to 100 percent, and financial assistance on loans. Moreover, the subisidies continue long after the plant is running. Government assistance, for example, is available to help shoulder the costs of training employees for new tasks. 'Image Problem Worldwide' **********''We've got a real image problem worldwide,'' explained John Dowdall, deputy chief executive of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board. ''So we have to use a generous incentive package to get overseas companies to look at us seriously.'' **********As a preferred, comparatively high-technology business, AVX qualified for large subsidies both for investments and training. ''It's a partnership with the government,'' James Sayers, general manager of the Coleraine operation, said. ''The assistance is specifically aimed at encouraging you to broaden your skills and technological base.'' **********The government's cooperation goes beyond financial aid. For example, AVX conducts joint projects and training programs with the province's two universities, Queen's University and the University of Ulster, which has one of its four campuses in Coleraine. Recently, University of Ulster researchers did econometric modeling work on the optimum monthly production mix for AVX. ''Those studies are basically coming to us for free,'' Mr. Sayers said. **********Coleraine is a religiously mixed community, about 70 percent of its people are Protestants and 30 percent are Roman Catholics. Mr. Sayers said the religious composition of the work force is within 1 percent of the community mix. Religion, he insists, has never been an issue at the company. AVX has never permitted any sectarian flags or banners in its factories, unlike a few of the mainly Protestant factories in Belfast. 'The Only Religion' **********''If it's not a poster for the AVX golf society or a recognized charity, we don't let it up,'' Mr. Sayers explained. ''Whatever religious or political differences people may have are left at the factory gate.'' **********''The only religion we have in here,'' Mr. Sayers added, ''is to make capacitors profitably.'' **********Mr. Sayers happens to be a Catholic overseeing a predominantly Protestant work force. The 44-year-old general manager was recruited from another multinational company nine years ago. ''I was about to be promoted out of Northern Ireland and I certainly didn't want to leave,'' he said. **********In a region periodically wrenched by violence and suffering from one of the highest unemployment rates in Western Europe, local government officials point to the AVX experience as evidence that businesses can thrive in Northern Ireland despite the troubles. They stress that the sectarian violence tends to be confined to specific areas, like the Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road districts in Belfast. **********''Northern Ireland does have problems, but they are not ones that will impinge on your business,'' said Mr. Dowdall of the industrial development board. ''Any investor willing to look beyond Northern Ireland's poor political image will find an attractive place to set up a business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/20/world/using-rules-tactic-helms-stalls-senate-approval-of-arms-treaty.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1988-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 613, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Using Rules Tactic, Helms Stalls Senate Approval of Arms Treaty", "print_headline": "Using Rules Tactic, Helms Stalls Senate Approval of Arms Treaty", "body_text": " **********Senator Jesse Helms succeeded today in delaying action on the new arms treaty by refusing to bring forward amendments that he and other treaty opponents seek. **********Exercising his rights under Senate rules, Mr. Helms, a North Carolina Republican, blocked a move by party leaders to end consideration of the treaty itself and move on to consider a resolution of ratification. In the resolution, the Senate gives its advice and consent on the treaty, and at least a dozen senators hope to attach various conditions or understandings to the resolution. **********None of these can be offered until amendments to the treaty text are disposed of. Amendments to the text require renegotiation of the treaty with the Soviet Union. Conditions attached to the resolution of ratification can in some cases also require renegotiation. Interpretation Issue **********The most significant and controversial of the proposed conditions favored by Democrats is one intended to affirm the Senate's role in treaty interpretation. The condition has its roots in a longstanding dispute over the Administration's contention that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty can be interpreted to permit testing of certain components of the ''Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system. **********Senator Alan Cranston of California, the Democratic whip and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, has tried to compromise with Republicans and the Administration by proposing to delete a reference to ''constitutional principles'' in the condition. **********It is not clear, however, how much support Mr. Cranston's proposal has among other Democrats. Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee and who has been an influential figure in the A.B.M. interpretation dispute, said today that he had not yet agreed to any modified language. Possibly Delayed Until Monday **********As written, the treaty interpretation condition affirms that the President cannot reinterpret the arms treaty without consent of the Senate. The condition cites ''constitutional principles'' as the basis for asserting this view, and supporters of the condition contend this language would thus apply to other treaties. **********The Administration and Republican senators oppose the condition and particularly the phrase ''constitutional principles,'' arguing that the condition would assert rights the Senate does not have and would inappropriately constrain future Presidents. **********Mr. Helms's objection today means that the Senate may not get to any of the conditions until Monday, just two days before President Reagan is scheduled to leave for Moscow for the summit meeting with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The two leaders are scheduled to hold their first meeting May 29, and both are eager to have the treaty approved by then so that they can exchange the formal documents of ratification. The treaty bans land-based medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. Dole Complains **********Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the majority leader, said today that the Senate might have to work through May 28, a Saturday, to complete the treaty. **********As the Senate went into its third day of speechmaking on the pact, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, took to the floor to express his mounting frustration and concern over the delay. ''I would like to remind the senators on my side of the aisle that it is our President who is going to Moscow next week,'' Mr. Dole said. **********''If senators have amendments, they ought to offer those amendments, today,'' he said.

Major American investment banks are scaling back their international ambitions and rethinking their globalization plans. They are doing so because trading volumes have plummeted since the October stock market crash and because foreign investors are skittish about holding large chunks of dollar-denominated securities, even though the American currency has recently rebounded from its sharp decline. Fading Formula for Profits **********Fighting single-mindedly for market share in the crowded international capital markets, especially against the aggressive Japanese firms, no longer seems to be a profitable formula for most American securities houses. Many American firms had aggressively expanded in London, as well as in Tokyo, because of the generally accepted notion that the emerging world of international securities trading would touch three bases - Tokyo, London and New York - on a 24-hour odyssey. **********Now, the American firms are drifting toward fee-earning corporate finance activities, especially advising clients on corporate takeovers. **********Two developments reflect the strategic adjustment now under way: **********So far this year, an American investment bank, Goldman, Sachs & Company, is the leading financial adviser on British takeovers, a field once thought to be the bailiwick of London's merchant banks. **********Yet Goldman, Sachs and other top American investment banks like Morgan Stanley & Company and Salomon Brothers are no longer among the top 10 underwriters of Eurobonds. American firms had dominated the London-based Eurobond market, the hub of the international capital markets, for most of the 1980's. Most Eurobonds are issued by American corporations and foreign companies and governments as a way to attract dollars held outside the United States. **********American investment firms have been looking for places to cut costs because of the sharp slowdown in business in the months after the October market crash. The burgeoning London units were obvious candidates. Staffing at the London offices of major Wall Street investment banks had typically tripled or quadrupled in the past four years. So the staff cuts came, ranging up to more than 10 percent of the total payroll. High-Level Departures **********Some of the most dramatic changes occurred at the top levels. Top-ranking executives have resigned or have been replaced at the London units of many big investment banks, including Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch & Company and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. **********But the staff departures also reflect the shift of emphasis away from the Euromarkets. The most notable casualties this year have been the bankers who were the pioneers of the $650 billion Eurobond market, like Archibald Cox Jr., the former head of Morgan Stanley's London office, and Steven Licht and Caleb Watts, the two top capital-markets executives for Merrill Lynch here. Typically, the Eurobond stars were replaced by people known as administrators or more familiar with the deal-making side of the business. **********Still, investment bankers say they remain committed to the concept of retaining an integrated operation in all the major capital markets in London. The teams may be smaller, but they insist they will continue to sell, trade and conduct research on equities, British Government bonds and Eurobonds. **********''We have not dropped any of our businesses or pulled out of any markets,'' said Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd., whose London staff has been trimmed more than 10 percent, to 1,400, since early this year. ''What we have done is make adjustments as changes in activity warrant.'' **********Even though investment banks are emphasizing cost controls, there is a discernible reluctance by many senior executives to get carried away with cutbacks because they fear such cuts could permanently damage a firm's competitive position. ''You can't be on the periphery of a business,'' said Charles McVeigh III, managing director of Salomon Brothers International Ltd. in London. ''That is a prescription for disaster.'' Temporary Phenomenon **********This reasoning rests on the crucial assumption that the sharp falloff in trading and the return of investors to their home markets after the October crash are a temporary phenomenon. Most outside analysts agree with the bankers' reasoning. **********''I don't see the events of the past year bringing a sea change for these firms internationally,'' said Samuel Hayes III, professor of investment banking at the Harvard Business School. ''They were enormously overextended, having grown incredibly in London. So there was a lot of fat there - and there's more left to go.'' **********''But,'' he added, ''the forces of technology, deregulation and the internationalization of business generally that drove them overseas initially remain in place.'' An Era of Limits **********Still, the big American investment banking houses have unquestionably entered an era of more limited resources, in which management skills and charting longer-term strategies will play a far greater role than was the case in the days before the crash. **********In the future, even if the globalization trend abruptly resumes, the dominant role of the American dollar in international finance appears to be over and the United States is likely to remain a debtor nation for years to come. Both trends have clear implications for the major investment banking houses. **********''The U.S. firms will not have as big an investor base to tap as the Japanese, West Germans and Swiss,'' said Lowell Bryan, a principal for the consultanting firm McKinsey & Company. ''But the strength of the American investment banks is the know-how and financial engineering skills of their people. So they will have to focus more on value-added areas requiring specialized skills and not on commodity-type products in the capital markets.''  U.S. Firms Drop in Rank Among Eurobond Underwriters  American investment banks no longer make up a majority of the top 10 underwriters of Eurobonds. American firms had dominated the London-based Eurobond market, the hub of the international capital markets, for most of the 1980's. Companies in bold are American or American-affiliated.

So the creation last year of an independent agency empowered to denounce any and all abuses aroused considerable curiosity and even some hope. **********Several prominent Guatemalans with strong human rights credentials expressed interest in heading the agency, a post fraught with risk. But Congress chose a conservative lawyer, Gonzalo Menendez de la Riva, 83 years old, who was a leader in the fight against land redistribution during the regime of Jacobo Arbenz 35 years ago. **********Mr. Menendez opened an office in a residential neighborhood not served by public transportation, and he normally sees visitors by appointment only. He has not pressed for investigation of past crimes, nor has he commented on any of the several hundred killings that have occurred since he took office. His only major public statement has been to denounce an increase in electricity rates as a violation of human rights. **********The failure of Mr. Menendez's office to address basic human rights problems in Guatemala reflects the continuing power here of groups that have been dedicated to political violence. Although there is now a civilian President and an elected Congress, the military power structure remains intact. 'Still Don't Seem to Respond' **********Any effort to determine the fate of those who died under previous military governments would probably implicate past and present army and police officers, and President Vinicio Cerezo has rejected proposals that he order such an inquiry. Police investigations of violent crimes are still usually fruitless, especially when there are political overtones. **********''I can understand why the Government doesn't want to dig into the past, because you can argue that it makes no sense to endanger the living in order to do justice to the dead,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''But now, when there are new killings or disappearances, they still don't seem to respond with appropriate efforts.'' **********In addition to the agency headed by Mr. Menendez, the Guatemalan Congress has created a nine-member human rights commission. Late in 1987, at the end of its first year, the commission issued a report indicating that it had made no progress toward determining the whereabouts of missing people or the identities of their abductors. **********Under the new Central American peace accord, which was signed in Guatemala last August, each country in the region must decree an amnesty. But an international commission assigned to monitor compliance with the accord found that some countries had few or no political prisoners to whom amnesty could be offered because they had practiced ''physical elimination'' of opponents. 'We Didn't Pay Any Attention' **********''We didn't pay any attention to that phrase,'' said the Guatemalan Defense Minister, Gen. Hector Gramajo, in an interview. ''We took it as something that applied to El Salvador or Nicaragua.'' **********The peace accord also requires governments to promote ''an authentic pluralistic and participatory democratic process'' by respecting human rights and promoting social justice. **********Julio Santos, a spokesman for the President, said Guatemala ''is committed to complying with each and every part of the accord.'' **********But that view is not shared by everyone. ''Here the view is that the peace plan is something for Nicaragua to comply with,'' said Edmond Mulet, an opposition member of Congress. ''Most politicians in Guatemala have not read the peace plan, don't know what it means and couldn't care less if we comply or not.'' **********The accord requires each Central American country to open cease-fire talks with rebel groups, and there has been a single round of talks between Guatemalan authorities and guerrilla leaders. In November, a group of leftist exiles returned for a brief visit, holding press conferences and meeting with various organizations. **********The head of the exile delegation, Carlos Caceres, said the peace accord ''opens possibilities for democratic participation.'' But he said the group did not feel safe enough to stay in Guatemala. **********Although the army sets and carries out security policy in Guatemala, civilian politicians have taken increasing responsibility in other areas. The 1985 presidential election here was among the freest in recent Central American history. It was run by an independent commission, and featured participation by parties whose ideology ranged from socialist to far right. Bishops Offer Grim View **********The elected Government has fallen short of meeting popular expectations, however. Last week, Roman Catholic bishops issued a declaration that offered a grim view of conditions in the country. **********''We must recognize that our nation is living through an especially conflictive period in its history, deeply marked by the people's suffering due to economic crisis, criminal and subversive violence, unemployment and the high cost of living, all within the terribly violent context of Central America,'' the bishops wrote. **********''The present moment is also characterized by public confusion and fear of greater evils,'' they continued. ''There are very clear signs of disillusion, because evils inherited from the past are continuing.'' **********Guatemala's history of human rights abuses led to an embarrassing diplomatic incident recently. Mr. Cerezo designated the former Chief of State, Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, to be ambassador to Ecuador, and named Gen. Pablo Nuila Hub as military attache there. Both men have been accused of presiding over brutal counterinsurgency campaigns, and after protests in Ecuador, both nominations had to be withdrawn. **********Defense Minister Gramajo, who worked for years with both men, said that General Nuila might be named to another diplomatic post. He said he did not know if General Mejia was still interested in foreign service. **********''We no longer want to be represented by professional diplomats who smile and repeat pretty phrases,'' General Gramajo said. ''We want people who will truly defend our country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/world/pentagon-asks-no-new-weapons-in-return-for-backing-arms-pact.html": {"writer_name": "John CUSHMAN", "pub_date": "1988-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pentagon Asks No New Weapons In Return for Backing Arms Pact", "print_headline": "Pentagon Asks No New Weapons In Return for Backing Arms Pact", "body_text": " **********In a departure from their practice with previous arms control treaties, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are not demanding compensation in the form of new weapons as a condition for endorsing the new treaty governing missiles in Europe. **********Instead, the military leadership is saying that the treaty banning land-based medium- and shorter-range missiles is sound militarily - a much stronger endorsement than it gave previous arms-control agreements. **********In Senate hearings this week, the military continued to call for additional spending on new weapons after the treaty takes effect. But senior officers are carefully describing their endorsement as unconditional in an effort to prevent treaty's critics from scuttling it with binding conditions. Fear of Damaging Alliance **********In the face of budget cuts, the military leadership might have been expected to use its endorsement as a convenient bargaining chip with the Administration to trade for weapons that the Pentagon says it badly needs. Senior officers apparently fear that directly tying the treaty's passage to further arms investments could scuttle it and therefore damage the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without securing long-sought new weapons. **********By contrast, when the first strategic arms treaty was signed in 1972, the Joint Chiefs made clear in the public debate that their endorsement was conditioned on acceptance of a package of new nuclear weapons, including the B-1 bomber and the Trident submarine-launched missile. **********Likewise, when the Carter Administration unsuccessfully sought Senate approval of the second arms treaty in 1979, the military won a pledge that the Pentagon could deploy the MX missile. The Administration also laid the groundwork for a broad military spending increase, but it left office before the money was appropriated. Reasons for Supporting Treaty **********Military leaders have offered several reasons for not attaching conditions to the treaty. **********Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the senior military adviser to President Reagan, has testified that the military's concerns about the treaty itself were all favorably resolved during negotiations with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs' main areas of concern were the treaty's verification provisions, the inclusion of Soviet missiles deployed in the Far East, and the exclusion of French and British missiles and aircraft-delivered nuclear bombs. **********Admiral Crowe, who said that his views have been unamimously endorsed by the Chiefs, the uniformed heads of the military services, also has expressed pleasure at the fact that the treaty will lead to 400 American warheads being withdrawn, compared with 1,400 Soviet warheads. Importance of Allies' Backing **********Most important, military experts have testified, is the military's view that the allies are welcoming the accord. The favorable response in Europe, they say, may well lead to a stronger consensus there in favor of future military programs. **********Some Senators, skeptical of the treaty, have proposed to amend it to require a conventional balance of forces more favorable to NATO. **********The Pentagon has not backed away from its contention that the Warsaw Pact has been gaining on NATO in military capabilities. **********''Basic asymmetries still exist,'' said a Pentagon report delivered to Congress this week, ''because of the Warsaw Pact's geographic advantage and its ability to reinforce land and air forces from the U.S.S.R., and the major quantitative advantages it maintains in essentially every category of offensive forces.'' Arguments Against Linkage **********At the same time, military leaders said in testimony, the treaty must not be linked directly to redressing the alleged imbalance. **********''The improvements that we are advocating, and we strongly suggest, are not conditioned on the I.N.F. treaty,'' Admiral Crowe told the committee's senior Republican, Senator John Warner of Virginia, on Monday. ''We're disturbed about the balance today, and when the I.N.F. treaty is completed we're still going to be disturbed about it. They're separate and distinct.'' **********''In other words, the support that the J.C.S. has given this treaty contains no conditions?'' Mr. Warner asked. **********''No conditions,'' the Admiral responded. **********Even while endorsing the treaty without conditions, the Joint Chiefs have called for new atomic weapons for Europe, including nuclear artillery shells and more modern nuclear missiles with ranges just short of those covered by the new treaty. **********Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on conventional forces, asked Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on Monday whether the new treaty, or a future agreement cutting longer-range strategic forces, should be linked ''to either some conventional arms balance status or to some progress in conventional arms control?'' **********Mr. Carlucci responded that such a condition would be a ''killer amendment.'' **********''I would regard such an amendment as extremely undesirable,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/19/business/uaw-making-peace-with-japanese-in-us.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1988-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1439, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.A.W.

Making Peace With Japanese in U.S.", "body_text": " **********Using a strategy of ''compromise and organize,'' the United Auto Workers is coming to terms with Japanese car makers setting up shop in the United States. In doing so, the union is stemming a loss of members and bolstering its position as the intermediary between American auto workers and the industry. **********The Big Three auto makers are benefiting from the union's cooperation with the Japanese as they negotiate an increasing number of union contracts based on Japanese labor practices, which give them greater productivity. **********The U.A.W. has still not won recognition at any plants owned and operated solely by the Japanese. But it has scored victories in three United States-Japanese joint ventures, the latest coming last week at the Diamond-Star plant in Bloomington, Ill., a venture of the Chrysler Corporation and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. A Moderate Stance **********The union has been helped by the fact that at the joint-venture plants, the Japanese managements, in deference to their American partners, have not actively opposed the union. **********More important, at those plants the union has moderated its bargaining posture on key issues like work rules, supplementary pay and job classifications. **********To a large extent, labor's growing cooperation stems from a dawning awareness that overcapacity in the industry will almost certainly mean that only the most productive plants will be able to stay open. The U.A.W. wants to represent workers at the Japanese plants, as well as to keep its existing plants competitive. **********The Japanese companies, accustomed to pliant unions in Japan, seem satisfied working with the U.A.W. **********''Japanese managers are very pragmatic,'' said Vladimir Pucik, director of the East Asian business program at the University of Michigan. ''Of course, they would prefer not to deal with unions here, but when they do, the relationship turns out to be very comfortable.'' . **********James Gill, a spokesman for the Mazda Motor Corporation, said: ''The U.A.W. has been helpful to Mazda at our Flat Rock plant. The union is a resource for dealing with problems instead of dealing with 3,000 individuals.'' Suggestions to Managers **********In a practice that is unusual for American auto plants, union officials at the Ford-Mazda joint venture assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich., sit in on Mazda production planning meetings and may make suggestions to managers on topics like the speed of the assembly line. **********Besides the Diamond-Star and Flat Rock plants, the U.A.W. has won the right to represent workers at the G.M.-Toyota joint-venture assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. **********But the union has not managed to crack any Japanese plants. After three years of hard campaigning, the U.A.W. still has not felt confident enough to request a representation election at the Nissan Motor Company assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn. The union withdrew its application to hold an election at the Honda Motor Corporation plant in Marysville, Ohio, when it looked as though union support was not high. **********So far the union has not mounted a formal organizing effort at the Toyota Motor Corporation's new assembly complex in Georgetown, Ky., although a union spokesman said, ''It is fair to say that having that plant organized eventually is important to the U.A.W.'' **********The U.A.W. represents about 6,500 workers at Japanese-managed automotive parts and assembly plants in the United States; it represents about 480,000 workers at G.M., Ford and Chrysler. 'Continuous Improvement' **********Peter Laarman, the U.A.W.'s director of public relations, said the union was trying to develop a ''synthesis of traditional rights and protections afforded by union contracts with new manufacturing concepts like kaizen,'' Japanese for ''continuous improvement.'' As a practical matter, workers under kaizen are constantly encouraged to find flaws, suggest improvements in the manufacturing process and criticize their own performance - strange, almost fanatical concepts for workers accustomed to countering management criticism by filing grievances. **********By most indications, the union has been learning to live comfortably with Japanese management techniques. Reacting to the representation victory last week at the Diamond-Star plant, the U.A.W. president, Owen Bieber, said, ''It is clear that this recognition of our union is further evidence that there is no incompatibility between the U.A.W. and Japanese companies.'' Nearly 70 percent of the 872 workers signed cards in favor of U.A.W. representation. **********Significantly, however, instead of referring to ''workers'' - the term a union official would normally use -Mr. Bieber welcomed the Diamond-Star ''production and maintenance associates into the U.A.W. family,'' referring to the only two job classifications at the plant for assembly-line workers. Wary of Team Concepts **********The union has been wary of team concepts and reductions in job classifications because members believed they threatened job security. Having highly specific job categories forced employers to keep more people on the payroll. **********Supplementary pay was less controversial than issues that directly affected job security, but the union was cautious lest such programs supplant basic pay increases. The General Motors Corporation, at its progressive Saturn plant, is planning to link about 20 percent of U.A.W. workers' pay to productivity, another form of supplementary pay. **********Support for progressive labor contracts is not unanimous among the rank and file. Many union members remain suspicious that managers simply want them to work harder for less pay, a union official said. Moreover, political rivalries within the plants sometimes lead one faction to oppose elected leaders on the issue of flexible working conditions. **********Nevertheless, Ford and G.M. spokesmen say they are encouraged by a provision of their year-old national labor agreements that encourages local union leaders and plant managers to create more productive work environments. While G.M. declines to credit the Japanese ventures specifically for better labor relations, it has sent many managers to observe its Fremont joint venture with Toyota, where workers are represented by the U.A.W. Need to Stay Competitive **********''It's very clear that the Japanese transplants' labor agreements are very competitive in the American market and they do see a need for other U.S. plants to be more competitive in quality and productivity,'' said Anthony St. John, Chrysler vice president for human resources. **********Using the Japanese plants as a model, Chrysler has signed what labor relations specialists term modern operating agreements with workers at six plants. Under those agreements, the number of job classifications has been slashed from 125 or more to a dozen or so. This permits workers not needed in one part of the plant to work elsewhere, and reduces the total number of workers needed to run the plant. **********Workers are also paid for learning special skills. ''Pay for knowledge'' programs encourage workers to acquire skills that, in the aggregate, make the work force more flexible. Workers in the modern system have also agreed to ''team concepts,'' in which the team and team leader direct activities, set schedules and maintain discipline. 'Progressive' Contracts **********While Chrysler plants in Newark, Del., and Detroit are among the six plants with modern agreements, Mr. St. John said plants in Sterling Heights, Mich., and Belvidere, Ill., are the only ones with ''progressive'' contracts. What Chrysler calls a progressive contract is an intermediate stage between historical agreements with little flexibility in work practices and the modern agreements. The two progressive plants, he explained, have reduced job classifications but so far have declined to accept team concepts or pay for knowledge. **********Last year Chrysler's assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., was selected for permanent shutdown, which will take place later this month. Chrysler officials said the move came in part because labor leaders there had been slow to accept progressive labor practices. **********The Japanese managers at the Diamond-Star plant have a far easier time than Chrysler managers in instituting modern labor practices because they are dealing with a work force that has few preconceived notions of how a car plant ought to be run. Moreover, Japanese managers have gone to extraordinary lengths to select workers whose test results show they learn quickly and work cooperatively in a team. Using stringent guidelines and testing, Diamond-Star managers have so far hired fewer than 872 assembly-line workers from initial applications of more than 30,000. **********''Diamond-Star certainly is a learning ground for Chrysler, from a people as well as a manufacturing standpoint,'' said Robin Skiles, a Diamond-Star spokeswoman."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/16/business/at-loehmann-s-mystique-fades.html": {"writer_name": "Woody Hochswender", "pub_date": "1988-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Loehmann's, Mystique Fades", "print_headline": "At Loehmann's, Mystique Fades", "body_text": " **********For generations of style-seeking women, Loehmann's has offered a kind of fashion salvation, selling top designer clothes, without the labels, at a discount. But these days, women who once flocked to Loehmann's stores can find similar bargains elsewhere - at other discount houses, factory outlets and department stores that seem to offer perpetual markdowns. **********That is just one of the challenges facing the chain's prospective owners: Sefinco Ltd., a Spanish-owned investment firm, and the Sprout Group, a division of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, which agreed last week to buy Loehmann's from the May Department Stores Company. **********The image of Loehmann's as a unique high-fashion discounter has also been diluted by its own expansion. Because there is simply not enough top-of-the-line designer clothing to supply its 77 stores, the chain has had to offer less high fashion. **********''Back in its early days, when there were just a few stores, it used to sell the very expensive lines,'' said Linda Kristiansen, the senior retail analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''It's become more middle of the road.'' **********Nevertheless, Loehmann's profitability in recent years has been respectable compared with other discounters. In the fiscal year that ended in January, Loehmann's had operating earnings of $19 million on sales of $334 million. **********But its sales performance has been flat in recent months. In the first five months of the current fiscal year, its sales rose just six-tenths of 1 percent, to $136 million. In June, Loehmann's sales dropped 4.4 percent from the period a year ago, making it the only division of May to show a decline. **********Loehmann's has come a long way since the 1920's, when its founder, Frieda Loehmann, began profiting from Seventh Avenue's mistakes. Dressed from head to toe in black and carrying her cash in her bloomers, she rode freight elevators to the designer showrooms of the garment district, where she bought up samples, canceled shipments and other leftover garments, which she then sold at a discount at her single store in Brooklyn. **********As one longtime Loehmann's customer recalled, that landmark Brooklyn store, in a baroque building at Bedford Avenue and Sterling Place, had no dressing rooms. Women slipped in and out of clothes in the open while husbands and boyfriends chatted and read newspapers in the lobby. **********The no-frills atmosphere persists to some degree in today's Loehmann's stores, most of them in the Northeast. There are now three in New York City, and 12 others in the metropolitan area. Women still have to jockey for position among packed racks of dresses and slacks. Although there are dressing rooms, they are not private, so shoppers can still experience the selling magic of a total stranger calling across the room, ''Darling, that's for you.''  Mystique Has Faded **********But the mystique surrounding the store and its founder is largely gone, a casualty of fierce competition and the discounter's own expansion. Mrs. Loehmann had steadfastly resisted growth beyond the company's Brooklyn and Bronx stores. In 1964, two years after her death, the company went public and began an aggressive expansion policy. **********''The proliferation of Loehmann's and stores like it has resulted in a loss of exclusivity,'' said Mindy Krantz, sales manager for Kathryn Conover Dresses, a company that used to sell its overproduced styles to Loehmann's but no longer does. ''It used to be that if you wanted something designer at a great price you could only go to Loehmann's. Now you can go anywhere. **********Ms. Krantz said her company stopped selling to Loehmann's about two years ago. ''They were all over the country,'' she said, ''and we had too many complaints from our department and specialty store clients, who would stop at Loehmann's and see our goods there.'' **********Discounters are in no sense obsolete. As Ms. Krantz pointed out, the major designers have to project their sales long before they receive orders from stores, especially if the garments are cut overseas. At the end of every season, most manufacturers have goods on hand, known as ''overages,'' which discounters like Loehmann's can salvage. **********Loehmann's also still benefits from the relationships it has developed with many designers and manufacturers, who agree in advance to sell their unsold goods exclusively to it. **********One industry executive who asked not to be identified said: ''They can still out-buy any other discounter in the United States. When you have 500 to 700 units left at the end of each season, and you have someone who regularly cleans you out, you tend to go with that person.'' The fashion industry has five seasons a year.  Cash and Missing Labels **********Loehmann's built its reputation by dealing with distressed manufacturers in cash, which is looked upon kindly in a business burdened with credit, and by selling its high-end merchandise with the labels cut out. Part of the chain's allure is its cryptic coded tag system, which clever shoppers try to decipher in the legendary back room where the more expensive styles are hung. **********At the Loehmann's store in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, a hangarlike structure at Broadway and 236th Street, a wide selection of designer merchandise, mostly from the spring season, is arrayed on row after row of pipe racks. Roughly one-third of the garments still had their labels, including moderate-priced clothing from Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein Sport, Bob Mackie Knits, Anne Klein II, Bernard Perris, Blassport, Perry Ellis and Krizia. **********But none of the merchandise that still had labels was at the designer-collection level. Dresses in this high-end category, of which there were few, were hung against a far wall under a sign saying ''Backroom'' - a vestige of the exclusive back-room areas of earlier stores. There is no separate back room in the Riverdale store. **********A discount chain the size of Loehmann's cannot cover its sales floors with the surplus product of only the top design houses. ''I don't think you could run 77 stores on our end of the market,'' said Gerald Shaw, president of Oscar de la Renta Ltd., the design house. ''What we are getting rid of at the end of the season is very limited.''  Many Discount Competitors **********Complicating matters for the discounters is the increased markdown activity of the department and specialty stores during a period of soft women's apparel sales. Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''Sales in department stores have been rampant, and Loehmann's price differential is squeezed.'' **********Mr. Shaw added: ''They're competing with major retailers and tons and tons of discounters. The whole picture has changed. If Momma Loehmann were alive today with one store, she probably couldn't exist.'' **********Additional pressure has resulted from the rise of designer factory-outlet stores throughout the Northeast. These serve as a relief valve for overproduced merchandise, eliminating in some cases the need for a fashion discounter. Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Anne Klein, Ellen Tracy and others have such ''company stores'' from Maine to upstate New York, where bargain-hunters can combine vacations with shopping expeditions.  13 Outlets Closed **********A May Department Stores spokesman said the company had closed 13 ''poor-performing'' Loehmann's stores in the last 12 months, while opening three new ones. **********May Department Stores and Loehmann's executives declined to comment on the reasons for the sale. Analysts have suggested that it might fit into May's strategy of focusing on department stores. May obtained Loehmann's when it bought the Associated Dry Goods Corporation in 1986. Associated had purchased the chain in 1983. **********Analysts also noted that the sale might help May pay for its recent acquisitions of the Filene's and Foley's department store chains. **********''May Department Stores didn't sell them because they were a drain on profitability,'' said Ms. Kristiansen of Dean Witter, who added that Loehmann's return on investment has been high. ''It's just not a strategic fit.''

He has been held forth by some experts as someone who could serve as a bridge between rival Afghan factions and possibly become a unifying symbol in a government formed after the Soviet troop pullout, promised by Feb. 15. **********The Soviet official, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, told a news conference that the talks today were useful and that both sides had agreed to meet again. **********Moscow wished to consult with ''political groups that will comprise the broad-based Government,'' Mr. Vorontsov said, ''and in that general picture comes the meeting with former King Zahir Shah, which we had today.'' **********Mr. Vorontsov, who is also the Soviet Ambassador to Kabul, met earlier this month in Saudia Arabia with Afghan rebels based in Peshawar, Pakistan. **********While declining to discuss the role for the King, the Soviet official said, ''We are trying to bring the Afghans together at one table.'' **********He added, ''We are not trying to impose any scheme on them for a future government, only the initial steps: how they should sit together, and in what form they should discuss the future of their country.'' A Role for the Soviets Sought **********According to some diplomats, Moscow may be seeking King Zahir Shah's involvement as a way to insure some sort of future role for members of the Soviet-backed Government of President Najibullah. Moscow-backed governments have been in power in Kabul since 1979. **********Reuters quoted Afghan rebels in Pakistan as criticizing the talks. They reportedly said Moscow should be negotiating only with the guerrillas, asserting that ''the Russians' purpose is to divide the Afghan people.'' **********King Zahir Shah, who has lived outside Rome since he was deposed in a 1973 coup, made no statement after the meeting. In a brief interview, Gen. Abdul Wali, his son-in-law and chief aide, said the contact had been sought by the Soviet side and that Mr. Vorontsov ''was received for an exchange of views on matters related to Afghanistan and the region.'' Soviet Commitment Cited **********Mr. Vorontsov told reporters at the residence of the Soviet envoy to Italy that his Government remained committed to completing its troop withdrawal by Feb. 15, and that he and the King had discussed the call for a Jan. 1 cease-fire that has been made by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********In a recent interview with VisNews, an international television agency, King Zahir Shah rejected a cease-fire, saying that it would not be acceptable to Afghans so long as Soviet troops remained in his country. **********Mr. Vorontsov declined to say what the King said about a cease-fire. ''But, I think I have the right to say that Zahir Shah stated that he fully supports the idea of stopping the war at the earliest possible time in Afhganistan.

''The country was in peril,'' he said today. ''The job was thrust upon me.'' **********Despite the fact that his Government has imprisoned thousands of people over the years on politically related charges, Mr. Chun says no South Korean has had less freedom than he. ''The one person in the country who has been deprived of this valuable commodity, personal liberty, is the president,'' he told foreign journalists. **********When one gets right down to it, Mr. Chun added, ''it is a rather stressful occupation'' to be South Korea's national leader, and he said he was glad to be turning over the reins soon to someone else. ''I can assure you,'' he said, ''it was not all pleasurable duty.'' **********With less than a month to go before he leaves office, Mr. Chun cannot shake free of his past, and he is still called upon to justify the bloody means by which he took power and the often harsh methods he has used to retain it. It happened to him again today as he briefly threw open the gates of the Blue House, the presidential residence, for his first - and presumably last -news conference with foreign reporters. Dismisses Legitimacy Issue **********In the opinion of many Koreans, he has never established his legitimacy, at least not according to their Confucian traditions. Asked about that today, however, Mr. Chun replied: ''The question of legitimacy does not exist as far as I'm concerned. That legitimacy issue is political rhetoric.'' **********A more important point, he insisted, was that he is about to step aside voluntarily, something no major South Korean leader has ever done before. It will be an ''epoch-making event in the democratic development of Korea,'' he said, and will end a four-decade cycle of ''protracted one-man rule and changes of government by revolutionary means.'' **********Not only that, Mr. Chun added, but he is also turning over the Government to someone who has won South Korea's first genuine presidential election since 1971, Roh Tae Woo, an old ally and fellow former general. The election last month was ''a fair and just and open process,'' he said, and Mr. Roh, the Government party candidate, won with ''overwhelming'' support. **********Left unsaid was the fact that Mr. Chun had long opposed such an election and agreed to hold one only after it became clear that he could no longer resist popular demands for it. Also unmentioned was the reality that Mr. Roh, far from winning overwhelming support, captured only 36.6 percent of the vote. **********For most of his eight-year rule, Mr. Chun has been a remote figure, and so his decision to have a luncheon and question session with 100 foreign reporters represented a significant last-minute shift in style. He Seems Relaxed **********In televised speeches, he often comes across as wooden and humorless. But he seemed relaxed today, telling a few mild jokes and smiling at obviously anticipated questions. **********Still, tension was never far below the surface in the gilded banquet hall. Reporters were ordered to leave their tape recorders outside the door - for security reasons, they were told. For apparently the same purpose, they were also instructed to remove all rings from their right hands before shaking hands with the President. **********By many standards, Mr. Chun should be able to leave office to ringing cheers. Under his stewardship, the South Korean economy has boomed, and the country has greatly enhanced its diplomatic standing, most conspicuously by winning the 1988 Summer Olympics for Seoul. **********And yet he remains what he has always been - a highly unpopular figure, a point conceded by members of his own party. Even Mr. Roh had concluded that to win the election he had to run against Mr. Chun's record as much as against the opposition candidates. His campaign speeches were filled with denunciations of authoritarian government, official torture and official corruption. **********All along, Mr. Chun's albatross has been the Kwangju massacre of May 1980, when he consolidated his control under martial law. **********Anti-Government demonstrators took to the streets then in Kwangju, a southwestern provincial capital. From May 18 to May 27, troops sent into the city by then-General Chun killed nearly 200 people, by official count, or many times that number, according to local residents. **********To many South Koreans, the word ''Kwangju'' is as instantly evocative as ''Sharpville'' and ''My Lai'' are in other countries. It clings to the South Korean President like tar paper. 'Unfortunate and Tragic' **********''It was a most unfortunate and tragic and regrettable incident, and the thing to do is to heal the wounds of that incident,'' Mr. Chun said today. He did not apologize, though, and never has, though many Kwangju residents insist on an apology as a condition of reconciliation. **********After he steps aside on Feb. 24, Mr. Chun will automatically become head of a group of political elders called the State Advisory Council, and he will receive a pension and lifelong security protection. **********Before the election, rumors were rife that he feared for his personal safety in the event of an opposition victory, and he reportedly had begun searching for property in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Now, it is widely assumed that he will stay in South Korea, although that is not a certainty. **********There have also been persistent reports that he will somehow try to retain behind-the-scenes power, perhaps from a post-retirement job at the Ilhae Foundation, a Government-sponsored research center. **********Nothing is clear, though, except for one thing, Mr. Chun says, and that is that the days of military takeovers are over. **********''It will not happen again,'' he said. ''It should not happen again. If it should, Korea would bring a misfortune upon itself.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/09/business/april-output-by-opec-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "April Output By OPEC Up", "print_headline": "April Output By OPEC Up", "body_text": " **********Oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to 18.2 million barrels a day in April from 17.7 million barrels in March, the International Energy Agency said Friday. **********The April figure includes a daily output of 2.6 million barrels by Iraq, which did not sign the group's production sharing program.

Before the transaction, Alleco had planned to buy in and retire the debt - a 9.5 percent convertible senior subordinated debenture - at $1,050 per bond. After the transfer, Servam dropped the plan, and the bonds collapsed from more than $1,000, which New York arbitragers had been paying, to recent levels around $560. **********The indenture trustee, the First Trust National Association of Minneapolis, got on the wrong side of wounded bondholders - including Salomon Brothers - by what an executive there calls a ''failure to communicate.''

But some of those gains were retraced later on, as market participants awaited tomorrow's release of data on employment in the United States. **********In late trading, the Treasury's closely watched 9 1/8 percent bond was offered at 98 1/4, up a quarter-point on the day, to yield nearly 9.30 percent.

Six-month bills were unchanged on the day, at an offered rate of 7.48 percent. **********The dollar's rise against the yen -which pushed it to levels not seen since early November - was prompted by comments from unnamed Bank of Japan officials. They said the central bank had no intention of raising interest rates to prevent the dollar from rising further. **********The dollar's rise, coupled with the possible tax on some stock transactions, led some credit market participants to assume that Japanese interest in dollar-denominated securities may pick up again soon. **********''So far we haven't seen any visible trading evidence,'' one government securities trader said. ''But a stronger dollar and a tax increase over there could be two good reasons for the Japanese to make some more dollar investments.'' **********Although market participants agree that upcoming August employment data will provide the market and the Federal Reserve a good indication of how the economy is performing, a body of opinion is building that holds that the central bank will not choose to tighten monetary policy further unless the report is exceptionally strong. **********A report showing that payroll employment rose by 250,000 or more last month would qualify as a figure the Fed might react to. **********''We are getting very close to the political season where the Fed can't do much,'' one government bond trader said.

But if the number doesn't show much, the market will assume that the Fed won't push up the funds rate, and that it will remain on ice until after the election.'' **********Since the Fed's discount rate increase on Aug. 9, the overnight Federal funds rate has ranged between 8 and 8 1/4 percent.

Pillsbury said courts in five states had issued temporary restraining orders blocking Grand Met from buying Pillsbury stock. **********That did not stop Grand Met officials from showing up in Pillsbury's home town of Minneapolis to press their cause for the $60-a-share, $5.23 billion bid the company announced Tuesday. Grand Met said at a news conference that they had no plans for a wholesale breakup of Pillsbury. They also stressed that they were eager to meet Pillsbury officials to discuss a friendly combination. Stock Jumps by $18 **********As the New York Stock Exchange's most active issue, Pillsbury jumped $18, to $57, in response to the offer, which expires Nov. 1. Analysts speculated that Pillsbury might respond by finding a friendly suitor willing to pay more.  [ Page D10. ]  Phillip L. Smith, who became Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive during the summer, declined to take a telephone call this morning from Ian A. Martin, the head of Grand Met's United States operations. Pillsbury's official response was that its directors would review the offer ''at an appropriate time.'' It urged shareholders not to tender their stock. **********The widespread view among analysts was that Pillsbury would reject the offer. During the news conference this morning, Grand Met officials said all the indications they had received pointed to a rejection. ''Pillsbury is bristling with anti-takeover measures,'' Mr. Martin said. **********But Pillsbury, which owns Burger King, Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and other businesses, may have little choice but to accept Grand Met's offer. The offer would not only give Pillsbury shareholders a 53 percent premium over the price their shares were trading at last week, it is also well above what most analysts think Pillsbury is worth. 'It's Christmas Early' **********''It's Christmas early for Pillsbury shareholders,'' said L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth Inc., a Minneapolis-based brokerage. **********And June D. Page of Bear, Stearns & Company said, ''I'd get on a plane to tender my Pillsbury stock.'' **********Pillsbury, which has been plagued for months by turnover in top management and troubles in both its food and restaurant business, appeared totally taken off guard by the offer. Roger L. Headrick, Pillsbury's chief financial officer, told a reporter for The Minneapolis Star and Tribune late Monday night that he ''didn't know anything about the offer.'' **********Mr. Smith, Pillsbury's chief executive, was not formally notified until this morning. Evidently the first time anyone even remotely connected with Pillsbury learned of the offer came shortly before the close of business Monday. That was when lawyers for Pillsbury were informed by a court clerk in Delaware that Grand Met had filed a lawsuit there to try to have Pillsbury's ''poison pill'' anti-takeover provision voided. Few Workable Alternatives **********While Pillsbury's formal response may not come for days, company executives have said in the past that they would like to remain independent. **********That may be harder done than said, however - and not simply because of the attractiveness of the offer. Pillsbury's big problem, analysts say, is that it has few workable alternatives. **********For example, Pillsbury might seek a friendly merger partner. But analysts said they considered it unlikely that another company would come to Pillsbury's rescue because it would require paying more than $60 a share. **********Pillsbury might also attempt a restructuring as a way to give shareholders an immediate return. Presumably, this would consist of selling off businesses and returning the proceeds to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. **********But it is unclear how Pillsbury could produce more than $60 a share from such a breakup; the most optimistic of analysts have given Pillsbury a breakup value of $56.Burger King could bring more than $1 billion, analysts say. But some on Wall Street say unloading the unit could leave Pillsbury even more vulnerable. Leveraged Buyout Possible **********Pillsbury could also attempt a leveraged buyout. This would involve a group, presumably led by Pillsbury's management, that would borrow billions to take the company private. Although buyouts of this magnitude have been successful in the past,analysts say Pillsbury does not have the cash flow to support a major addition of debt. **********Pillsbury might also try to follow in the footsteps of another Minneapolis-based company, the Dayton Hudson Corporation, and enlist the support of local politicians. When Dayton Hudson got word last year of a takeover attempt by the Dart Group Corporation of Washington, it persuaded the Minnesota legislature to hold a special session to pass anti-takeover legislation. Grand Met said it met today with state officials to try to win their support. The outcome of those meetings was not disclosed. Suit Over 'Poison Pill' **********A final possible defense is Pillsbury's ''poison pill.'' Adopted in January 1986, the provision would allow Pillsbury shareholders in the case of a takeover to buy stock at half price in either Pillsbury or the acquiring company. It is unclear, however, if Pillsbury's poison pill will withstand the scrutiny of the courts in Delaware, where Pillsbury is incorporated and where the provision faces the Grand Met lawsuit. **********Pillsbury might also hold out for a slightly higher price. In a letter to Mr. Smith of Pillsbury, Mr. Martin of Grand Met said he was prepared to negotiate. But at the news conference today he said, ''I'm a Scotsman, and I don't throw any extra money around.'' **********Grand Met officials said today that they would sell Distron, which is Burger King's troubled distribution unit, as well as two of Pillsbury's leading restaurant units, Bennigan's and Steak & Ale. In its lawsuits, Pillsbury cited state laws that prohibit a manufacturer of liquor such as Grand Met from also acting as a retailer of liquor. Both Bennigan's and Steak & Ale serve liquor. **********Grand Met is the world's largest producer of spirits. Its products include J& B Scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Almaden wines. It also owns Alpo pet food and Pearle eye-care centers.  AT A GLANCE: PILLSBURY CO.

But the mood turned gloomier after further evaluation of the trade numbers. **********During the day, the market saw price swings of as much as 2.75 points, or $27.50 for each $1,000 of face value, in the Treasury's long bond, the 8 7/8 percent issue due in 2017. This is an extraordinary intraday price range for a Treasury issue, either the long bond or shorter maturities. **********Moments after the opening, the long bond soared 1 3/8 points, to 107, on news that the trade deficit had declined by $1 billion, to $12.2 billion in December. But late in the day, after some bargain hunting, the long bond was offered at 104 26/32, down 31/32 on the day and 1 17/32 for the week. **********As a result, the yield on the long bond rose to 8.44 percent, from 8.32 percent the day before and 8.29 percent a week ago. The new long Treasury notes, the 8 1/8 percent issue due in 1998, dropped 21/32, to 99 7/32, for a yield of 8.24 percent.  'Numbers Weren't That Positive' **********''Once the back-office people took a good look at the trade data, it became apparent that the numbers weren't that positive,'' said Alan R. Leslie, chief economist at the Discount Corporation of New York. ''For example, the category designated as 'undocumented exports' had doubled in the month, to $944 million, from $457 million. With one stroke, one can thus explain half the decline in the deficit.'' **********Mr. Leslie noted that ''undocumented exports largely cover shipments of goods to Canada by truck and are at best estimates used in compiling the monthly trade statistics.'' A Commerce Department official said that a value was assigned to such goods with the aid of import documents filed with Canada because shippers did not file the papers needed for identification by product. **********Mr. Leslie said there was less of a delayed reaction to news that January's Producer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent, ''because it raised the specter of inflation down the road.'' He added: ''Moreover, the P.P.I. rose in spite of lower energy costs in January.''  Fed Move Unsettles Market **********Meanwhile, the credit market was somewhat unsettled by a move by the Federal Reserve to drain reserves from the banking system through four-day matched sales-repurchase agreements, market participants said. **********Just a day earlier, the Fed similarly drained reserves for a five-day period. On both occasions, the Federal funds rate, the basic interbank overnight lending rate, was 6.5 percent. This level is widely held to be a bit below the Fed's assumed ceiling of 6.75 percent. **********For those credit market analysts expecting the Fed to soon ease, rather than tighten, credit, the central bank's actions appeared odd. But William V. Sullivan Jr., chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said he believed that the Fed's action was justified by fears that reserves were being inflated by a sharp increase in the ''float,'' or checks that are assumed to be in transit. **********When the float increases, it expands the volume of reserves in the money market, Mr. Sullivan explained.  Weather Called a Factor **********''Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that the float has been greatly inflated this week by the severe weather in the Midwest,'' Mr. Sullivan said, ''and that the Fed was only moving to offset some of the reserves caused by the huge float delayed in Chicago, the nation's busiest air hub, and other banking centers.'' **********When matched sales-repurchase agreements are used to drain reserves from the banking system that the Fed has apparently deemed excessive, Mr. Sullivan continued, ''there is a tendency for the process to lift the discount rates on Treasury bills, as was the case Thursday and today.'' **********Yesterday, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills rose 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent; the companion six-month bills gained 9 basis points, to 6.01 percent, and the one-year bills were up 7 basis points, to 6.25 percent. **********Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of corporate issues posted more moderate declines, and there were fewer new issues offered. **********Among those offered were $100 million of the Transamerica Financial Corporation's 8 3/8 percent junior subordinated 20-year notes. The notes were priced at 99.757, to yield 8.481 percent. The notes, underwritten by a group led by Morgan Stanley & Company, feature a five-year ''put'' that permits investors to sell the issue back to the company at par."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/20/business/net-up-sharply-at-major-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Net Up Sharply at Major Banks", "print_headline": "Net Up Sharply at Major Banks", "body_text": " **********Several major banking companies announced strong increases in first- quarter profits yesterday, led by Citicorp, the nation's largest, whose net income rose 34.1 percent, to $358 million. **********Other banks to report results yesterday were the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, where earnings growth was limited to 1 percent by a sharp reversal in foreign exchange trading; Wells Fargo & Company, with a 54 percent increase in profit; the Bank of Boston Corporation, up 19 percent, and the Mellon Bank Corporation, with net income of $25 million after a loss a year earlier of $60 million. **********After the large losses announced in 1987, the generally strong earnings were a relief to analysts. **********''Earnings have been in line with expectations or better,'' said Mark Alpert, a bank stock analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. He noted that spending restraint had helped profits at many banks, and added that ''money center banks seem to be recognizing that the answer to their earnings problems does not lie in booking more loans but in good control of expenses.'' **********The first-quarter earnings at many banks received a strong assist from the sustained growth of the American economy, which encouraged them to reduce their provisions for loan losses. Profits were insulated from the banks' problems with loans to less developed countries because of huge increases in loan-loss reserves announced last year. **********''The likelihood of the economy providing a reasonably healthy backdrop for our business is quite high,'' said John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp. ''We are operating in a somewhat less hostile credit environment than was the case in the last three or four years.'' **********Although worries that the economy would suffer after the stock market's steep selloff in October have helped keep bank stock prices depressed, Mr. Reed noted after the annual meeting yesterday that the economy appeared strong, with little evidence of rising inflation or other indications of a significant, imminent change in interest rates.  Citicorp **********Citicorp, which also announced an increase in its dividend to an annual rate of $1.48 a share from $1.35, said its first quarter profit of $358 million was equal to $1.01 a share, up from $267 million, or 87 cents per share, in the quarter a year earlier. The 16 percent gain in earnings per share was less than the 34 percent gain in income because Citicorp sold 40 million new shares last year. **********The stock offering, which raised $1.1 billion , was part of a series of moves to replenish the banking company's capital after it announced a $3 billion increase in its loan-loss reserve in May. The higher reserve, which was soon imitated by other major banking companies, resulted in a loss for all of 1987 of $1.138 billion. **********The largest single contributor to the improved earnings at Citicorp was a decline in its provision for loan losses to $283 million in the first quarter, from $474 million a year ago. Expenses other than those for interest paid on borrowed funds declined 2 percent from the fourth quarter and were about 13 percent higher than a year ago, well below the 28 percent growth rate reported in the first quarter of 1987.  Bankers Trust **********At Bankers Trust, the nation's eighth-largest banking company, earnings growth was limited to 1 percent by a sharp turnaround in its foreign exchange trading, from a large profit to a modest loss. Net income for the quarter was $126 million, or $1.61 a share, up from $124.2 million, or $1.77 a share, in the quarter a year ago. The per share results declined because of new shares issued last year. **********The weaker performance in the foreign exchange trading was no surprise in the financial markets, where there had been rumors of a first-quarter loss since the departure in February of Andrew J. Krieger, a currency trader who was a guiding force in Bankers Trust foreign exchange trading. In the fourth quarter Bankers Trust earned $337.7 million in such trading, or more than half the $592.8 million earned during all of 1987. In the first quarter, foreign exchange trading produced a loss of $19.4 million, which was offset by profits and commissions of $67.6 million in other trading activities, such as Federal and municipal bonds. **********The earnings growth at Bankers was based primarily on the wider gap between the interest it paid on deposits and borrowed funds and the interest it received on laons. The bank's provision for loan losses fell to $10 million from $22 million in the year-ago period.  Wells Fargo **********Wells Fargo, the 11th-largest banking company, had a 53.8 percent increase in profit, which was attributed largely to gains in net interest income, reduced expenses and a smaller provision for loan losses. Net income rose to $120.4 million, or $2.15 a share, from $78.3 million, or $1.36 a share, a year ago. **********Wells Fargo's statement of income showed that non-interest expenses fell $8.7 million from the year-ago quarter, while its provision for loan losses fell $5 million.  Bank of Boston **********Bank of Boston, one of the ''super-regional'' banking companies and the 12th largest in the country, earned $84.3 million in the first quarter, or $1.23 a share, up 19.1 percent, from $70.8 million, or $1.06 a share, a year ago. **********Non-interest revenues rose by $37.5 million from a year earlier, including gains from the sale of venture capital investments, foreign exchange trading and the sale of some domestic branches. Profit also benefited from a $9 million drop in the provision for loan losses, to $36 million. Non-interest expenses rose $12 million from the year-ago quarter, but were $9 million less than in the fourth quarter.  Mellon Bank **********Mellon Bank, the 16th-largest banking company, reported the sharpest turnaround in performance, with net income in the first quarter of $25 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with a loss of $60 million in the year-earlier period. For all of 1987, Mellon's losses totaled $844 million. **********The largest component in the improved earnings was a drop in Mellon's provision for loan losses to $45 million from $175 million in the first quarter of last year. **********As Mellon tried to rid itself of low-interest margin loans, and originate more loans for sale, its average level of loans outstanding fell by about $2.4 billion. The company's reduced size has been accompanied by reductions in operating expenses. Excluding expenses related to acquired real estate, operating expenses fell $5 million from a year ago, while staff expenses fell $21 million.  . . .

But Still the Group Endures", "body_text": " **********The Irish Republican Army routinely advises its new recruits that service in the guerrilla organization will most likely lead them to one of two destinations: a prison cell or a cemetery plot. **********Under a slate-gray sky today, two young brothers, Michael and Martin Harte, were lowered into freshly dug graves in this rural village, their coffins covered with the tricolor flag of the Irish Republic and the mournful wail of a lone bagpiper accompanying the ceremony. **********After having mounted a wave of deadly and successful assaults on the British forces in recent months, the I.R.A. has met with a series of reverses in the last week. **********The Harte brothers and one other I.R.A. member, who the police say were all armed, were gunned down last Tuesday by British soldiers on a country road in Northern Ireland not far from Loughmacrory. **********In West Germany last Wednesday, two men suspected of being I.R.A. members were seized as they tried to cross the border from the Netherlands with guns and explosives. **********And later on Wednesday, an elderly Roman Catholic couple were accidentally killed in Londonderry by an I.R.A. booby-trap bomb - the kind of bungled operation that undermines the guerrilla organization's standing among the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, which does not complain so loudly when the victims are British. **********Yet the events of the past week are but one slight turn in the grim and inexorable cycle of violence that has punctuated life in Northern Ireland for nearly two decades. The I.R.A. insists that Britain pull its troops out of Northern Ireland and that the province become part of the Republic of Ireland. And despite facing a combined British security force of nearly 30,000, or 100 times the size of the guerrilla army, it continues to keep the British troops on edge and in danger. **********Ever since the current troubles began in 1969, the strength of the I.R.A. has waxed and waned. Today the organization is estimated to have fewer than 300 active members, down sharply from 2,000 or so in the early 1970's. But over the years it has shown itself to be remarkably resilient, bouncing back from setbacks and losses again and again to revive its deadly campaign In the last six months, for example, the I.R.A. has stepped up its attacks on the military, killing 27 British soldiers in Northern Ireland, the British mainland and the European continent. The biggest single assault came Aug. 20 when an I.R.A. bomb blew up a military bus in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, killing 8 British soldiers and wounding 27. An Austere Ethos **********And the I.R.A. has demonstrated that even the powerful and highly placed are not beyond its reach, killing Earl Mountbatten in 1979 and only narrowly missing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984 with a bomb at a Brighton hotel. **********The survival of the I.R.A. is explained by its people, goals and tactics. Its members are committed people who believe in the righteousness of their cause: a united Ireland, with the 6 counties in the north joined to the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland. **********The ''Green Book,'' the I.R.A. manual, preaches modesty, abstemiousness and discretion, the austere ethos of a revolutionary army. A Belfast psychiatrist, Dr. H. A. Lyons, who has examined many I.R.A. members convicted of murder, concluded two years ago that they have ''clear ideals and goals,'' that they receive ''strong support from other members of the group'' and that, in all, they are a ''reasonably stable group of people.'' **********The nationalist aspirations of the I.R.A. are widely shared in the Republic and among Catholics in Northern Ireland, which is predominantly Protestant. That appeal, along with sectarian discrimination, helps explain why the outlawed I.R.A. can rely on an estimated 2,000 ''active sympathizers,'' who provide the guerrillas with safe houses for lodging and with intelligence, especially on the military's movements. **********But I.R.A. members are separated from the vast majority of nationalists by their willingness to kill and to die, like the Harte brothers last week. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., polled just 1.9 percent of the vote in the Irish elections last year, while in the north it typically garners about one-third of the Catholic vote, or less than 8 percent of the total ballots. It trails well behind the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which mainly represents nationalist Catholics but which opposes violence. 'The Vital Cutting Edge' **********Yet Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. remain committed to killing. In the view of Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, ''the armed struggle provides the vital cutting edge'' of the militant republican movement. Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, puts it more bluntly: ''Violence is the only language the British understand.'' **********The guerrilla army has endured partly because its objectives are limited and thus attainable. ''The I.R.A.'s goal is to show that they can consistently mount operations to keep the pressure on the British,'' said Dr. Brendan O'Leary, a lecturer at the London School of Economics. **********The I.R.A. has never said it will win its ''war'' against the British in any military sense. Instead, its objective is to so repel British politicians and the British public by the constant violence in Northern Ireland and by seeing their soldiers come home in coffins that the Government will eventually pull out. Assassination Squads **********The I.R.A. typically operates in local units of 6 to 10 people. They are essentially assassination squads, killing British judges, government officials, members of the security forces and, in recent years, building contractors and suppliers to the British forces in Northern Ireland. **********''The I.R.A. is a dangerous terrorist organization and it is geared to mounting successful operations on that scale,'' said Prof. Paul Wilkinson, chairman of the Research Foundation for the Study of Terrorism, a London-based organization. **********British intelligence reports say the three I.R.A. men killed this week by British commandos were on a typical mission: to assassinate an off-duty member of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a security force of local recruits. The I.R.A. men were carrying two Kalashnikov rifles and a .38-caliber revolver, the police said. Help From Libya **********The biggest help to the I.R.A. internationally over the last year has come from Libya, which has provided new and lethal weapons. The traditional American role as an arms supplier to the I.R.A. has been greatly reduced since the organization spent $2.5 million on a huge shipment that was seized off the coast of Ireland. The main support for the I.R.A. from Irish-Americans is now in the form of cash contributions, which came to an estimated $130,000 last year. **********British intelligence officials say Libya was the main source for four shipments of arms that landed in the Irish Republic since last year, including 1,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, five machine guns, 20 surface-to-air missiles and a large quantity of Semtex, a Czech-made plastic explosive that can pierce armor and is difficult to detect. Most of that arms cache is presumed to have made it across the border into Northern Ireland by now. **********The border is a considerable asset to the I.R.A. Despite the increased security cooperation between Britain and Ireland since their 1985 agreement, the guerrillas still have a safe haven in the south across a relatively open border. **********''Unless security at the border is greatly improved, the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland will never be kept under control,'' said Robin Evelegh, a retired British Army colonel who served in Northern Ireland in the early 1970's. Colonel Evelegh recommends a fence-like barrier running the 220-mile length of the border. **********The lines dividing Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. are blurred at best. Within the movement, there was a debate a year ago over how much emphasis to put on politicial activity as opposed to military operations, with Mr. Adams viewed as favoring the political route and Mr. McGuinness seen as a hard-liner. The I.R.A. campaign of accelerated violence in recent months is regarded as a sign that the exponents of violence won the debate. **********''The hard men in the I.R.A., who believe in increasing violence steadily and without limit, are much stronger within the organization than they were a year ago,'' Professor Wilkinson said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/20/business/market-place-bullish-views-on-some-stocks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Bullish Views On Some Stocks", "print_headline": "Market Place; Bullish Views On Some Stocks", "body_text": " **********ONE antidote to summer doldrums on Wall Street is drawing up lists of stocks expected to outperform the market in the next 6 to 12 months. The Standard & Poor's Corporation, which is cautious about the market's prospects, and Prudential-Bache Securities, which is bullish, have recently announced their picks. **********At S.&P., Arnold Kaufman, editor of The Outlook, said, ''We're not generally bullish, not generally recommending buying.'' S.&P. believes that the post-Memorial Day rally could carry the Dow Jones industrial average to 2,250 to 2,300 within the next few weeks, but expects the market to close the year a little lower than it is now, with the Dow at about 2,000. **********But The Outlook recently listed 10 stocks that are ''particularly attractive for investment at this time'': *********** American Express, where S.&P. projects earnings of $2.70 a share, more than double the $1.20 of 1987. It sees gains in travel and IDS Financial services, as well as in brokerage. *********** Champion International, one of the world's largest paper producers. S.&P. sees strong domestic and export demand and higher prices. *********** Chevron Corporation, which S.&P. says is among the most conservatively valued of the major oil companies relative to underlying assets. It is yielding 5.1 percent. *********** Corestates Financial, a New Jersey-Pennsylvania banking company with a large network of automated teller machines. It is yielding 3.8 percent and at $39.50 is trading at less than nine times the $4.50 a share S.&P. forecasts this year. *********** Dow Chemical, where S.&P. sees an earnings surge to $11 a share this year from $6.50 a share in 1987. One reason is the weak dollar and Dow's strong position overseas. *********** Federal National Mortgage Association, where S.&P. sees a rollover of high-cost debt and fewer liquidations than in past. *********** John H. Harland, a printer of bank checks and related forms. S.&P. views the company, which has a long history of earnings growth, as a possible takeover candidate. *********** Paccar, the nation's second-largest maker of heavy-duty trucks, a cash-rich company with little debt. S.&P. sees strong replacement demand for the nation's eight-year-old truck fleet. *********** UST Inc., which has 85 percent of the moist snuff market. Price rise should help profit margins, S.&P. says, and UST is yielding 5.1 percent. *********** Warner-Lambert, where major restructuring programs are paying off. S.&P. cites above-average growth in both ethical and over-the-counter drugs, an aggressive R.&D. program and more foreign expansion. **********Prudential-Bache Securities is ''quite positive on the market, both from a strategy and technical standpoint,'' according to Michael B. Keating, vice president and manager of equity research. The firm ''is calling for a summer rally that will last right into the fall,'' with 2,400 on the Dow this year, he added. **********In its Midyear Investment Outlook, the firm advocates full investment in equities and recommends three groups of four stocks each: **********Low p/e industrials. These stocks have price/ earnings ratios below the p/e of 12 that Prudential-Bache sees for the S.&P. 500 this year. Specifically, the firm says: International Paper has a strong balance sheet, high return on equity, excellent cash flow and potential dividend increases. Earnings for Phelps Dodge, the big mining company, will be explosive at $12 a share, thanks to strong copper demand. Stone Container will continue to chalk up productivity gains and to experience strong demand for its linerboard and corrugated board and boxes. The Witco Corporation, a diversified chemical producer, has a sound management team and strong financials. **********Total return stocks. Prudential-Bache sees a potential for price appreciation, as well as yields above the 3.5 percent it projects for the S.&P. 500. It says: Ford Motor with styling innovation and quality improvement will pick up market share in an industry that will benefit from lower oil prices. Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey utility, is selling at a discount because of the temporary closing of its Peach Bottom nuclear plant, but is near satisfying regulatory requirements. Tenneco's recent sale of assets should be very positive for near-term earnings. Union Electric, a Midwestern utility, offers an 8.2 percent yield and strong internal cash generation. **********Undervalued/special situation stocks. Pru-Bache favors: Hanson Trust P.L.C., a British company with strong American holdings and strong earnings growth; Long Island Lighting, which will get rate increases, tax benefits and other settlement guarantees for abandoning its Shoreham nuclear plant; Magma Copper, class B, which will benefit from lower production costs and strong copper demand, and Micron Technology, which will gain from strong demand for its DRAM chips and from a recent agreement with Intel. **********Shearson Lehman Hutton recently published its annual model portfolio of 10 ''uncommon values in common stocks,'' which it said represented a cross section of industries and market segments.

This is to enter a plea in the face of overwhelming public opinion as well as against the views of many, although certainly not all, economists. It would therefore seem to be a hopeless case. I hope to show that it is not. **********My argument hinges on two premises. The first is that public economic activities are as essential to the existence of our society as private economic activities. The second is that some part of government expenditure is normally used to support capital-building activities. On these two statements rests the case for a deficit - and as we shall see, the case for a good deal more than that. **********I will not waste time defending the premise that government-financed activities are necessary for our well-being. It is true, of course, that all public activities could conceivably be undertaken by private individuals. Lighthouses could be run as philanthropies. Patriots could finance a private army. Adam Smith himself suggested that judges might be paid by litigants. But as these examples illustrate, the difficulty with privatization is political, not economic. Without government sponsorship, not enough public goods would be supplied to satisfy our notions of what the public household should provide. In addition, there would be the suspicion that whatever goods were supplied catered to the interests of those who paid for them, not to those of the community as a whole. **********My second premise enlarges on the first. It is that some part of public spending normally builds capital. We usually think of public spending as financing consumption activities, such as the expenses of running the government itself. But there is also a substantial growth-promoting element in public spending. Even expenditure on Medicare, for instance, which is always classified as public consumption, might be considered, in part, as an investment in our productive capabilities. The building of roads and dams and public housing of course adds to public capital. So does the $20 billion to $30 billion spent by the Federal Government each year to support education and training, a strategic investment in growth.  Capital Financing **********Capital expenditure brings us closer to the crux of the deficit problem because it raises the vital question of how such expenditures should be financed. Because private capital projects are expected to yield their benefits over several years, common sense urges that they need not be paid for at once. Hence, companies such as utilities normally finance their capital outlays by the sale of new stock or by issuing bonds and households normally buy homes on mortgages. **********Precisely the same considerations apply to public capital formation. Roads, like power plants or houses, last a long time. The value of additional education should be good for many years. The same common sense therefore dictates that such assets also be financed by borrowing to spread the cost over their lifetimes. **********It would seem, however, that there is an important difference: new private investment will generally increase a company's earnings, whereas the government has no direct earnings, toll roads and such excepted. But this objection overlooks a public counterpart to the larger revenues that spring from a corporation's added plant and equipment. This is the growth in tax receipts that comes about because the government's capital spending - whether for education or infrastructure - increases the productiveness and therefore the incomes of its citizens. **********The grounds of my case are largely laid in place, but one small matter deserves attention before we go on. This is the confusion bred by the word ''borrowing'' itself, with its implications of financial imprudence followed by direful consequences. **********It is certainly the case that borrowing can bring trouble. Private companies can go broke floating bonds for projects that turn out to be white elephants and governments can ''invest'' in infrastructure that adds nothing to national productivity. The point to be rammed home, however, is that such miscarriages have nothing to do with borrowing as such. Tax dollars can be spent as foolishly as borrowed dollars, and a company's expenditures from income may be as disastrous as those from borrowed funds.  Safe Borrowing **********Once the pall of ''borrowing'' is lifted, it is not difficult to make the case for incurring a deficit - that is, adding to the national debt - when it is used to pay for public capital. Deficits are not so easily rationalized if they are used to finance consumption expenditures such as military payrolls (save in times of war) or entitlements like Social Security. Ordinarily, therefore, such expenditures will be covered by taxation. I say ''ordinarily'' because governments have both powers and responsibilities that private companies do not have. If private investment is insufficient to bring the economy to a high level of output, a government may wish to incur a deficit to stimulate business, even if the proceeds from borrowing are used to pay for public consumption. **********Alternatively, a government might wish to cover all its expenditures, including capital formation, by taxation, to dampen the inflationary tendencies of the system. Thus the larger economic issue raised by the deficit concerns its use as an auxiliary motor for, or a reverse thruster against, the momentum of the private economy. **********Two crucial issues now come to the fore. The first has to do with the effect of government borrowing on private investment. Here is where we encounter the frequently heard charge that a deficit will crowd out private capital formation by competing for funds and thereby raising interest rates.  Crowding Out **********Crowding out is clearer in theory than in fact. Financial markets are now worldwide, so that the impact on interest rates of the United States Treasury's demands for savings is much less than if the supply of savings arose from American sources alone. A second consideration is that insofar as public investment generates additional incomes, these in turn generate additional savings. Finally we must not forget that the actions of the Federal Reserve powerfully affect the availability of private credit. **********In 1982, when the deficit first climbed into triple figures (that year it came to $120 billion), interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds averaged 13.79 percent. By the end of 1987, after five years of deficits that totalled $1 trillion, corporate interest rates had actually fallen to 9.38 percent. So much for crowding out. **********But suppose there is good reason to expect crowding out in the future. What then? This brings us the second, perhaps the central issue in the confused argument over the deficit - namely, should private activity always take priority over public? **********I certainly do not intend to settle this vexing question here, but I do wish to make two points: First, surely some new public capital is necessary for our growth; and second, whatever that amount may be, surely it ''qualifies'' for financing through borrowing just as much as the private capital it may displace. **********A different way of putting this is that there may be political arguments against creating public capital, but there are no strictly economic arguments against financing it by borrowing that do not apply with equal force against private capital. **********Consider the question of inflation. It is undoubtedly the fact that if we borrow and spend when the country is near full employment, prices will rise. But in such a situation the same effects will follow from private borrowing and spending. The argument, I need hardly say, also applies to the charge that deficit spending swells private incomes which are then spent on imports, thereby worsening our foreign trade deficit. If true, this must also apply to private investment, which has the same consequences. **********Let me now flesh out the argument with numbers. In fiscal 1987 we ran a deficit of $150 billion. According to the Special Analysis of the Budget issued each year by the Office of Management and Budget, Federal expenditures that year included ''investment-type'' outlays of $209 billion. More important, taking the period from 1984 to the present, our entire deficit was matched by increases in what the O.M.B. classifies as our national capital. Our addition to the national debt was equipped by our addition to the national wealth.  Investment Spending **********This calculation, however, includes within ''investment-type'' spending about $90 billion to $125 billion a year of military hardware and military-related research and development. No doubt a case could be made for including at least some of the military research as national capital, but in the interest of financial conservatism let us simply exclude all military spending from consideration. Over the years, this leaves us with something near $100 billion as useful Federal capital expenditure. At least that much of our deficit, therefore, was not dissaving but investment, not riotous living but prudent provision for the future. **********That is the base from which a rational consideration of the deficit must start. It is not, of course, the be-all and end-all of rational fiscal policy. I would like to see the various government accounts considered as one, which they are not today - state and local budgets and the vast social security trust fund lumped together with federal revenues for expenditures before we decided if in fact we are running a national deficit at all. As Robert Eisner has pointed out, we might then find that the trouble is not a governmental deficit but an unmanageable govenmental surplus.  New Accounting **********I would also urge the separation of the Federal budget into a capital and current portion and I would like to see the capital portion considerably expanded to meet what seem to me to be crying needs for additional public infrastructure, education, research and training. No doubt that would give rise to a Congressional scramble to have pet projects qualify as capital expenditures. But better such a scramble than the absurdity of considering all public spending as consumption. **********Finally, if there is concern about our tendency to run up consumer debt, I have often thought that private savings might be encouraged by the issuance of inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, paying a lower than market interest rate and available only to American households in moderate amounts each year. **********These are all matters about which economists and politicians will differ. What they cannot differ about is the propriety of a ''deficit'' incurred to pay for public capital. **********It is interesting to speculate on how we might react to such a change in perspective. Perhaps we would rename our Treasury bonds ''National Wealth Certificates.'' Perhaps the deficit would lose its potency as a symbol of national profligacy and a great psychological burden would be lifted from our shoulders. Above all, the management of our national economy would be rescued from fear and foolishness and brought within the grasp of political responsibility and public comprehension."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/13/business/refunds-bigger-on-87-returns.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Refunds Bigger On '87 Returns", "print_headline": "Refunds Bigger On '87 Returns", "body_text": " **********Fewer Americans are rushing to file their Federal income tax returns this year as they grapple with the new rules of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

It also has 17 million acres of native hardwood forests with largely untapped commercial potential and large tracts of protected rare species. **********The Chilean forestry industry has been aided by climatic conditions that are thought to allow rapid growth of the radiata pine, which was introduced into Chile from the Monterey Peninsula in California. Those conditions include sharp daily shifts in temperature, rich soil, a relatively disease-free environment, regular rains in the southern growing area and proximity to the sea. **********''Here, the radiata pine has found a better place to grow than in its place of origin'' said Ivan Castro Poblete, the executive director of the Government forestry agency, known as Conaf. **********''It can be cut here in 25 years, a fraction of the time it takes to grow in the Pacific Northwest,'' he said. Diversified Markets **********Another key factor in Chile's forestry success has been its diversification of markets. Ten years ago, Argentina took half of Chile's forestry exports, while today it buys about 6 percent.

''But now, the head of a Chilean company who doesn't go to China once a year would be fired by his board.'' **********Chile's forestry industry is in private hands, but the Government, through Conaf, provided subsidies of $75 million for planting costs between 1974 and the present. The subsidy program is intended to be terminated in the early 1990's. **********Subsidies require forest owners to replant after the trees have been cut. **********Conaf officials say that about 45 percent of the forest plantations are owned by large companies and about 55 by small farmers and individual investors. **********A number of foreign companies have bought into Chilean forest lands and industrial companies involved in forest products in recent years, often through the debt-equity swap program. That allows foreign companies to buy Chilean foreign debt at a discount and sell it to the debtor bank for pesos at a premium generally worth 30-40 percent. $425 Million Deal The biggest such deal was completed in July, when three foreign companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Citicorp and the Scott Paper Company, bought a cellulose plant and forest lands worth $425 million. **********Two New Zealand conglomerates, Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge Ltd., are also active in forestry activities in Chile. **********Some of the biggest operators on the Chilean forestry scene, including the long-established Compania Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones, are locally controlled. **********Most of the planted forests in Chile are found in the area from Concepcion, 350 miles south of Santiago, to the area around Valdivia, about 500 miles south of the capital.

A number of relatively small companies have opened and are making laminated products, doors, partly assembled furniture, briquettes that serve as pollution-free boiler fuel, and other items. **********Chile's forestry industry will still require substantial investment in the next few years by both private business and the Government to make the potential pay off. **********Mr. Castro estimates, for example, that the Government will have to invest $2.5 billion to $3 billion in roads and other improvements in the main forestry and port areas. **********He said private firms would probably build several additional cellulose plants at a cost of $350 million to $500 million each."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/business/company-briefs-015888.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Adler & Shaykin announced that it had completed its acquisition of Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. for $14 a share, or about $190 million. *********** Agent Acquisition Inc., a newly created Delaware corporation formed by certain agents of Atlas Van Lines, said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire Atlas Van Lines and its sole stockholder, Atlas Holdings Inc. *********** Farm and Home Savings Association, Nevada, Mo., has reached agreement with Lomas & Nettleton Financial Corp. of Dallas to terminate their pact for Lomas & Nettleton to acquire Farm and Home for $24 a share, or about $168 million, in cash and notes. *********** FMC Corp., Chicago, received a $148 million contract with the Army to supply M-1 tank track shoe assemblies and spare parts. *********** Gescan Products, Research Triangle Park, N.C., a division of General Electric Co., is being acquired by a group of former G.E. executives led by Dale W.

CREEDON is not a man who makes hyperbolic statements. But the chairman of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is angry and mincing no words. In explaining the lawsuit he recently filed against F. Ross Johnson, chief executive of RJR Nabisco Inc., Mr. Creedon said he is sending a message to corporate executives and investment bankers who, in his words, ''rape'' bondholders. **********''It's time somebody blew the whistle and said, 'Is this what we want in our financial markets?' '' said Mr. Creedon, whose company has a $25 billion corporate bond portfolio. **********Such inflammatory talk is unusual in the bond markets, but this month emotions have run high. Mr. Creedon and other bondholders claim that they have been abused by corporate executives and Wall Street bankers swept up in the debt-crazed takeover binge. They believe that shareholders are profiting at their expense, reaping huge premiums as bond values plummet under the weight of staggering new debt loads. **********Steps are being taken to protect bondholders from such shocks in the future, but many investors and market experts say that the changes may not be enough. Some corporations that want to raise money in the bond markets, for example, are being forced to include such protective covenants as ''super poison puts'' in their trust agreements. The puts would guarantee that bondholders could return the bonds to the issuer at par (the issue price), under certain circumstances. **********But these devices will not solve all the problems, say some portfolio managers. And obviously what protections they offer will benefit only the holders of new bonds. They will do nothing, the managers say, to insure the value of the $150 billion of bonds that have been issued by blue-chip corporations and are held by pension funds and individual investors. **********Indeed, many bond experts suspect that this is only the beginning of what will be a long battle among bondholders, corporations and investment bankers. ''Frankly I don't think the last shot has been fired,'' said Curtis R. Welling, a managing director and co-head of the capital markets group at the First Boston Corporation. **********ULTIMATELY, some of the experts say, the uncertainty will end only when the buyouts themselves die out, either from market forces or new legislative and regulatory curbs. **********For now, though, uncertainty reigns. The market for bonds of high-quality consumer products companies has slowed to a crawl as a result of the RJR Nabisco battle, which subsequently attracted other buyers like Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company and First Boston. (Bonds for manufacturing, financial and utility companies have been relatively unscathed.) In that battle, bonds of RJR Nabisco with a par value of $100 plunged to about $71, from $85, after a management group led by Mr. Johnson and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. proposed a leveraged buyout. At the same time, the price of the stock climbed to as high as $89, from $55. **********And just as important, the fear rippled throughout the bond markets. Individual investors, who have invested $9 billion in mutual funds that own high-grade corporate bonds, and institutional investors like the North Carolina State Pension Fund have suffered huge paper losses. Worried that other high-quality companies will be acquired in highly leveraged deals, investors have knocked down prices of bonds of such consumer giants as Ralston Purina, Procter & Gamble and Sara Lee. **********Prices of industrial revenue bonds of municipalities that are tied to corporate financing also have fallen. **********And junk-bond investors are concerned that the financing needed for giant takeovers might overwhelm the high-yield market. **********''There's beginning to be a sense that this has gotten out of hand,'' said Morey W. McDaniel, chief finance counsel of the Union Carbide Corporation, who has published a paper on buyouts and bondholders. **********Of course, this is not the first time that bondholders have been hurt in a corporate takeover battle or other restructuring heavily dependent on debt. During the battle with the Campeau Corporation earlier this year, the bonds of Federated Department Stores fell more than 17 percent, according to dealers at First Boston.  A Market Paralysis **********But the magnitude of the battle for RJR Nabisco - whose price may climb to $26 billion - paralyzed the market for bonds of consumer companies because investors realized that almost no company was safe from a buyout. Moreover, the participation of investment banks as investors in the transaction has galvanized many institutional investors. This time, they are considering boycotts against the investment banks that also are major Wall Street bond firms. **********The outrage of institutional investors is similar to the complaints by stock investors last spring who threatened to stop doing business with Wall Street firms that use their own principal in program-trading accounts. **********''We're hearing a lot of grumbling,'' said an executive at one Wall Street bond firm. The grumbling was loud enough to result in the formation of the Institutional Bondholders Rights Association earlier this year, even before the RJR Nabisco battle began. The group was formed by a group of investors led by Richard S. Swingle, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, and Madeline E. Glick, founder of M.E.G. Asset Management in New York. **********So far, the bondholders' association has not sparked any organized backlash. But portfolio managers across the country say they are particularly upset at Shearson's role in the RJR Nabisco drama. Several investors, who asked not to be identified, said they were considering penalizing Shearson's bond group by withholding trades for several months. **********The firm was one of the main underwriters for the tobacco and food company's bonds, helping it to issue almost $300 million in bonds last spring. Then in October the firm emerged as a principal investor in the proposed buyout of the company, an action that overnight devalued those bonds. **********One portfolio manager who questioned a Shearson bond salesman about the firm's role in the transaction was told that it represents Wall Street's ''new breed of ethics.'' Metropolitan's Mr. Creedon said his lawyers were still deciding whether to include Shearson in the company's lawsuit. ''We considered it and haven't ruled it out,'' he said. ''We don't know all of the facts of what happened.'' **********At Shearson, an official refused to comment on the lawsuit or the firm's obligations to its customers.  The 'Wealth Transfer' **********In a leveraged buyout, corporate management and other investors borrow large amounts from banks and junk-bond investors to buy out stockholders, who are paid a premium over the market value of their shares. But with the addition of new debt, the company's outstanding bonds are turned into junk bonds as prices plunge and yields soar to compensate for the additional risk that the company might not be able to meet its suddenly greater interest costs. **********Thus, a highly leveraged buyout can produce what some academics have described as a ''wealth transfer'' from the bondholders to the stockholders. Indeed, in a study of 65 buyouts and takeovers published a few years ago, two professors showed that the transfer of wealth was significant. **********In the buyouts that used the most debt, bondholders on average suffered a loss of 4 percent of their holdings, according to John D. Martin, professor of business administration at the University of Texas at Austin, who co-authored the paper with Douglas Cook, professor of business at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  'Event Risk' **********Of course, some argue that the ''event risk'' of a buyout is part of the risk that a bondholder must shoulder. After all, bondholders are providers of capital; they are not owners, like shareholders. And if they hold their bonds until maturity they will receive the face amount of the issue no matter what happens in the secondary market before that date - unless, of course, the company's new indebtedness sends it into bankruptcy. **********In the past, courts have held that company directors have no fiduciary obligation to bondholders. In other words, they are not legally bound to protect the bondholders' investments as they are with stockholders. **********But some legal experts believe that Metropolitan Life and the ITT Corporation, which has also filed a Federal suit against RJR Nabisco, may be more successful than those involved in previous suits. Metropolitan is charging that under contractual law RJR Nabisco owes its bondholders a ''continuing duty of good faith and fair dealing.'' And ITT has charged that the company violated securities laws by failing to disclose that management was considering a leveraged buyout. **********''As long as the facts support the complaint I think it has a high likelihood of being successful,'' said James D. Cox, professor of law at Duke University, about the ITT suit. **********Ironically, both ITT and Metropolitan have invested in leveraged buyouts in the past. But executives at Metropolitan now are questioning whether to continue such investments. ''We may have been part of the problem,'' Mr. Creedon admitted. ITT officials have said they will make no new commitments to leveraged buyouts. **********While legislators have been talking about curbing debt-finance takeovers, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies have been quiet. And few expect any action soon. ''If the Government will not take note of this deal you might as well just close down the S.E.C.,'' said Benjamin J. Stein, a Los Angeles-based lawyer and economist who has long been critical of leveraged buyouts. **********Meanwhile, in reaction to the volatile bond markets, many investors either are shunning bonds of consumer products companies or are demanding protection from any losses that might result from additional debt. **********Over the past few years at least 50 companies, including United, Eaton, Rorer Group and Kerr-McGee, have added clauses to their debt agreements that protected bondholders. But the clauses came into play only in the event of a hostile takeover. Often, protracted acquisition battles have ended as ''friendly'' transactions, making the covenants virtually worthless, even though the bonds have lost value. **********But in recent weeks, two companies, the Harris Corporation and the Northwest Pipeline Corporation, announced plans to issue bonds with ''super poison put'' provisions. These covenants protect bondholders from more than six possible restructurings that would result in a credit downgrading. In those situations, investors can ''put'' their bonds back to the issuer at par value or the company will change the interest rates so that the bonds trade at par.  Still Not Satisfied **********Investors are not entirely satisfied with these new issues, however. They complain that in the case of Harris the put lasts only 10 years. And others grumble that the ability to get back the price at par does not protect them if the bond is trading at a premium over the issue price when the transaction occurs. **********It remains to be seen whether the financial officers of other consumer products companies will choose to restrict their financing options by including these poison puts or whether they will leave them out and pay higher rates to investors. Issuers have generally been cutting restrictions from their debt agreements since the 1970's and are not eager to put them back in. **********''Issuers were very happy to get these covenants out of their debt and are not real happy in having their financing flexibility restricted,'' said Thomas E. Bernard, a managing director of Salomon Brothers. **********For now, though, the market for high-grade bonds of consumer products companies appears to be at a standoff. **********''Bondholders have been taken advantage of for decades,'' said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif., which invests $18 billion in bonds for institutional clients. ''It's time they stood up and fought issuers and investment bankers who have taken advantage of them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-ddb-legend-to-pursue-new-career.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; DDB Legend To Pursue New Career", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; DDB Legend To Pursue New Career", "body_text": " **********HELMUT KRONE surveyed his art studio, a loft in the SoHo section of Manhattan with a paint-spattered tarp covering its wood floors and large canvases hanging on the walls, and confessed that he was frightened. **********''I walk over there, I don't know what to do,'' said Mr. Krone, as he pointed his cigarette at a painting entitled ''Here Lies Buxtehude.'' He added, ''I'm scared.'' **********Coming as it was from one of advertising's most celebrated art directors, the admission was unexpected. In his prime, he was a scourge of copywriters. But at the age of 62, Mr. Krone is retiring from his job as executive vice president/creative director at DDB Needham to pursue the life of a painter. **********Mr. Krone and a handful of others at Doyle Dane Bernbach developed modern advertising. Under the direction of Bill Bernbach, they formed paired sets of art directors and copywriters, an unheard-of innovation in a trade that previously thought art directors were little more than layout people. Together, Bernbach's creative teams turned out advertising that was brash, witty, unexpected and legendary. **********Mr. Krone's work is more memorable than most. He was the art director behind Volkswagen's ''Lemon'' campaign; the fellow responsible for Avis's ''We try harder'' ads; the creator of Juan Valdez, the personification of Colombian coffee, and the genius who thought of using a Polaroid photograph of Louis Armstrong to illustrate Polaroid's advertising. **********''Helmut was one of the leaders of the creative revolution,'' said George Lois, who worked with Mr. Krone at Doyle Dane before leaving to form his own agencies. **********Robert Levenson, a former head of Doyle Dane's creative department and now vice chairman of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, said, ''Among art directors, there's Helmut Krone and then there's everybody else.'' **********Mr. Levenson said Mr. Krone's influence on advertising was ''architectural.'' His work, while varied in style, had a ''less is more'' look that Mr. Levenson credited to his friend's study of the German architect Mies van der Rohe. **********Indeed, Mr. Krone tends to describe his work architecturally. ''I've found more ways to break up that space with the same components - headline, picture, copy, signature,'' he said. ''It's like a chess game.'' **********His techniques varied. For Volkswagen, he used a large, unadorned photograph of the car with the tiny word ''lemon'' underneath it. The body copy, in even smaller type, was almost a footnote. For Avis, his very next campaign, the headlines were big and bold, the photographs small. **********''Helmut put pressure on himself to be different each time,'' Mr. Levenson said. **********For a man so identified with Doyle Dane's New York school of advertising, Mr. Krone is surprisingly benign, even benevolent, in his attitude toward the agency's merger in 1986 with Needham Harper Worldwide, an agency with a decidedly more Midwestern outlook. **********''I'm a New Yorker; compared to Keith Reinhard, I do abstract art,'' said Mr. Krone of DDB Needham's chairman, whose advertising origins are in Chicago. ''If he has a problem at all, it's with the troops in New York, who think his sense of humor is a bit off. Keith has said, 'Advertising must smile.' That went over like a lead balloon. But he may be right.'' **********''Anyway,'' he added, ''Bernbach always did 'smile' advertising. What would you call Avis, other than advertising with a chuckle?'' **********Yet Mr. Krone is characteristically acerbic on other subjects. ''Anybody can be a writer,'' he said dismissively. Account people are no longer willing ''to go to clients and die for an ad today.'' As for clients, they are ''all 34-year-olds with M.B.A.'s.'' Advertising itself, he said, ''is a cultural wasteland.'' **********His devotion to art, which he says is influenced by the work of Jackson Pollack and Anselm Kiefer, will not tame Mr. Krone, say friends like Mr. Levenson. Nor will his new art erase his memory of what preceded it. **********''If I ever come out with a book, it'll be 8 1/4 inches by 10 1/8 inches,'' Mr. Krone said. ''That's standard composite magazine size. That's been my canvas. It's been my life.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/11/business/dow-rises-6.30-to-2003.65-trading-slows.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1988-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 778, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Rises 6.30, to 2,003.65; Trading Slows", "print_headline": "Dow Rises 6.30, to 2,003.65; Trading Slows", "body_text": " **********Trading in stocks was slow yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average managing enough of a gain to put it barely back above the 2,000 level. **********Ending its four-day losing streak, the Dow rose 6.30 points, to close at 2,003.65, in a session that had the fourth-lowest volume of trading this year.

On Wednesday, gold fell below $400 an ounce to its lowest level in more than a year and a half. And many experts expect prices to fall even more in coming months. The slide has convinced some portfolio strategists and economists that an increase in the rate of inflation - a threat that has hung over the financial markets since the October market crash - may not be a concern after all. **********''My interpretation of it is that inflation is not a problem,'' said Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. **********If the falling prices of precious metals and other commodities hint at a slowdown in inflation, the recent price break might present a buying opportunity in the metals. Slower inflation would make stocks and bonds more attractive as well. **********But if the recent price drop presages a much bigger decline in inflation or even deflation (a more remote possibility), the only financial assets to buy are bonds, they say. Outright deflation could throw the world economies into a depression and many companies into bankruptcy. **********Richard Russell, editor and publisher of the Dow Theory Letters in La Jolla, Calif., believes that the price plunges in the metals markets signal deflation in the coming year. Almost all commodities, except cattle, have been under selling pressure in recent weeks, he said. **********''Personally, I think bonds are the best value around,'' he said. Mr. Russell added that in a deflationary market, investments that provide income, like fixed-income instruments, would be the only financial securities investors would be buying. **********The metals price break began in the gold market and spilled over into the silver and platinum markets, which often take their cue from gold. ''Gold's the leader in this market,'' said John P. Norris, vice president in the precious metals group at Citibank. The total world supply of gold produced in 1987 was 65 million ounces, while the total supply of platinum was only 3.1 million ounces, he added. **********There are several factors behind the collapse in prices of the metals. For one thing, the dollar has been increasing in value for most of the year. And gold and the dollar traditionally move in opposite directions. **********There has also been a change in the characteristics of the gold market. New techniques have reduced the cost of mining the metal to $200 an ounce from $300. The lower mining costs have led producers to increase the gold supply and consumption has risen. Consumption of silver, meanwhile, has increased throughout the 1980's, said Fred Demler, vice president and economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********And while the gold supply has increased, there has been a change in demand. As the price of oil has declined in recent months, the Soviet Union and some of the Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries have had to raise cash by selling gold, traders said, putting pressure on prices. **********''When oil producers can't produce oil, they are forced to sell gold,'' said Peter Canelo, investment strategist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. **********Moreover, traders report little buying by other countries. They suspect that newer buyers of gold, like Taiwan and Japan, which have trade surpluses with the United States, have cut back their purchases and are buying dollars instead. **********Most experts, expecting prices to fall further, suggest that individuals avoid buying gold or any of the other metals in coming months. When gold broke through the important psychological level of $400 an ounce on Wednesday, traders suggested $380 as the next support level it would test. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Norris of Citibank said the lower prices were attracting bargain hunters last week. ''Over the short term, at some point, we're going to realize the market is oversold,'' he said. ''Before that happens, we might go a little lower.'' Investors who want to own gold or other metals have several ways they can invest: ***********Bullion. Investors can buy gold or platinum coins or bullion bars and lock them away. Such gold coins as the Canada's Maple Leaf or China's Panda and platinum coins like Canada's Platinum Maple Leaf and the Australia's Koala are usually more expensive than bullion, but they do not have to be assayed and can be stored more easily. ***********Gold stocks. The securities of mining companies are much more volatile than the price of the metal. Many are of South African companies, subject to political as well as economic risk. ***********Gold-oriented mutual funds. These make the best investment alternative for individuals who want to own gold stocks but do not know which to buy. The funds own a diversified portfolio of stocks. There are more than two dozen of them offered by such large organizations as Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group. Among the largest are the Van Eck Gold/Resources Fund, the Franklin Gold Fund and the International Investors Fund. ***********Gold futures. This is the most speculative way to bet on the direction of the metal's price. The contracts require the investor to buy or sell gold at a specific price on a set date. Profits and losses can be huge. **********Michael H. Sherman, chief investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, seemed to sum up the general feeling of analysts about the precious metals when he said he would not recommend buying the metals now except as pure trading vehicles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/11/business/a-challenge-to-chip-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Challenge To Chip Accord", "print_headline": "A Challenge To Chip Accord", "body_text": " **********The European Community on Friday urged the world trade body GATT to rule that a Japan-United States accord to maintain high prices for Japanese microchip exports violated free-trade rules. **********David Woods, official spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, told a news briefing that the 12-nation Common Market had asked the GATT's ruling council to adopt the report.

Au Printemps, the Paris department store, wants to open its first New York store at that location, and Christian Dior and Calvin Klein also have an eye on the property. **********The nearby site offers Bergdorf an opportunity to increase the size of some departments that it thinks have the potential to sell more merchandise if they had more floor space. Specialized Merchandise **********Despite the inconvenience of requiring shoppers to walk across the street, the satellite store could be identified with specialized merchandise, like women's shoes, jewelry or handbags and gloves, retailing executives said. In downtown San Francisco, they noted, Macy's has a men's wear store less than a block away from its main store. **********The building, three floors with 50,000 square feet of space, is owned by Hexalon Real Estate Inc., a Dutch real estate investment concern. John Works, managing director of LaSalle Properties, the managing agent of the property, declined to comment on the reports by industry executives that Bergdorf had bid for the property. But he conceded: ''There are rumors that Bergdorf, Printemps, Calvin Klein, Christian Dior and Fred the Furrier are interested. I can't comment on rumors, but the property is still not leased.'' **********Unlike comparable fashion retailers, including Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, Nordstrom's in Seattle and I. Magnin in San Francisco, the owners of Bergdorf have declined to open additional stores, with one exception. A second store was opened in White Plains a decade ago, then closed after several years. **********No new Bergdorf stores have been opened since then, in part because Bergdorf has had three different owners with varying expansion policies, retailing experts say. **********It is currently owned by the General Cinema Corporation, which bought 60 percent of Neiman-Marcus last year from Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. The rest of the shares are publicly traded. The store was previously owned by the Goodman family. **********Part of Bergdorf's problem is finding a comparable site with the potential to support the full range of merchandise carried at the main store. Fashion Mecca **********Bergdorf has for years been a fashion mecca for Americans and foreign tourists. It reportedly has sales of more than $1,000 a square foot, one of the most lucrative store yields in the country. The store started in a single building on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue and has grown into adjacent buildings on West 57th Street, bringing in annual sales of more than $100 million. **********In a similar situation, Henri Bendel - for years a single store on West 57th Street - is being transformed into a national chain by its new owners, the Limited Inc. **********Ira Neimark, Bergdorf's chairman and chief executive, declined to discuss the store's negotiations. Peter Farwell, public relations director for the Neiman-Marcus Group, said the company did not comment on reports. But real estate executives said the negotiations were proceeding for the site with Bergdorf and other retailers. Toy Store for 50 Years **********The former F.A.O. Schwarz building, empty and under renovation, became available when the toy retailer moved in April 1986 from the location it had occupied for more than half a century into the General Motors Building directly across 58th Street. **********Bergdorf's competition for the 745 Fifth Avenue space with the Calvin Klein interests apparently pits the store against one of its supplier-designers. Two years ago, Bergdorf introduced a salon on its third floor to sell about 40 new Calvin Klein furs, coats, pants and dresses. Bergdorf also features many other designers from the world's couture. **********The White Plains experiment began in 1974, when Bergdorf opened a branch on a suburban knoll between branches of Saks Fifth Avenue and B. Altman. But the store did not draw the expected traffic and proved unproductive, partly because of the large size of its atrium and a museum-like interior. **********In January 1980, Carter Hawley Hale Stores decided to change the store from a Bergdorf to a Neiman-Marcus store. It is the only local outpost of that Dallas-based chain. Founded in 1901 **********Bergdorf was founded in 1901 by Edwin Goodman, the son of a Lockport, N.Y., merchant, and Herman Bergdorf, a women's tailor. It moved to the present site in 1928. In 1951, Mr. Goodman's son, Andrew, became president and operated the business until 1972, when it was sold to Carter Hawley Hale. A few years earlier, Andrew Goodman wanted to open another store in Chicago but shelved the plan when his own son decided he preferred radio broadcasting to retailing. **********Bergdorf was acquired by its latest owner, General Cinema, when Carter Hawley Hale spun off its interest in its specialty stores.

But once the victims leave the site, the medical task can become much more challenging. **********In recent weeks, an estimated 60,000 Kurds have fled Iraq, many of them claiming when they arrived in Turkey that they had been gassed and that many of their relatives had been killed in gas attacks. They told of Iraqi aircraft dropping blue canisters that made little noise as they burst open to spread a yellow gas. **********Turkish doctors examined refugees with burns and other symptoms consistent with exposure to poison gas, but the doctors said they could not be sure of the cause of the symptoms. They said the refugees' injuries could have been caused by poor nutrition and the generally harsh mountain life of the Kurds. What Are Classic Symptoms?  The classic symptoms of the most severe mustard gas poisonings are scarred flesh, clouded eyes and seared lungs, and little else mimics this medical picture, according to medical journal articles and interviews with experts. In less severe cases, the victims may suffer minor skin burns without lung damage. Some Kurds who fled to Turkey suffered such symptoms. **********Earlier this month, the United States said it had concluded that poison gas had been used by the Iraqis in their drive against the Kurds. **********Iraq, which denies the accusation, rejected a United Nations request to send an inspection team to the area where the attacks are said to have taken place. Turkey has said it would permit a Red Cross team to examine suspected gas victims in refugee camps, but has refused to admit a team of poison gas specialists. **********It is difficult to know whether Washington or Baghdad is right, experts say. One, Dr. Jan L. Willems, a Belgian Army medical officer who also teaches toxicology at the University of Ghent Medical School, speaking of the general problem of accusing a government of using chemical warfare poisons, said ''the final conclusion is always a political one'' because it relies in part on nonmedical sources such as intelligence information. **********One difficulty in diagnosing chemical warfare poisoning is that those who flee a gassed area are likely to be among the less severely injured. The distinctive features may be less apparent in milder cases, particularly to doctors who are not experienced with mustard gas, which was first used in a war in 1917 near Ypres, Belgium, and hence sometimes called yperite. Few Recognize Symptoms **********Because of the rarity of chemical warfare poisonings since World War I, the overwhelming majority of civilian physicians are unfamiliar with the pattern of symptoms the chemical produces and only a very few doctors have treated such cases. **********Moreover, the diagnosis is even more difficult to make if a doctor first examines such a patient many days after the onset of symptoms and after healing has obscured key features. Also, the likelihood that laboratory tests would show chemical residues of mustard gas poisoning depends on how many days had passed between exposure and the collection of the samples analyzed. **********Mustard gas reacts very quickly in the body and ''does not stay around as such for more than a very short time'' before it is converted into other substances, said Dr. John Ambre, a physician and toxicologist at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. In humans, the chemical traces of mustard gas disappear faster than the wounds heal. **********Toxicologists say it is easier to identify the chemical in samples taken from the environment. Mustard gas literally sticks to the ground and does not deteriorate quickly when it is in contact with the elements. **********Laboratory tests to detect evidence of mustard gas in humans require expertise and sophisticated equipment that are available only in a few laboratories in the world, said Col. Michael Dunn, who commands the United States Army's Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. **********Mustard gas is a yellowish oily liquid with a garlic-like odor that, depending on conditions, can also exist as a vapor or gas. There are a variety of mustard gases that are effective as chemical warfare agents because they can penetrate clothing, even leather, in a few minutes. The most common is dichlorodiethyl sulphide. Weapons Dumped After 1945 **********In recent years, doctors have reported several cases of mustard gas poisoning among fishermen off the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic sea, where 200,000 tons of mustard gas shells were dumped. Containers weakened by corrosion are occasionally picked up in trawlers' nets and sometimes break open when the nets are hauled aboard. **********Additional thousands of tons of mustard gas were dumped off the Danish island of Christiansen and the Swedish island of Gotland after the chemical was found stockpiled in Germany after World War II. **********Symptoms tend not to develop until from one to 12 hours after mustard gas touches the skin or is inhaled or swallowed. That delay, which averages four hours, is a key feature that distinguishes mustard gas from other chemical warfare agents. Nerve gases and lewisite, which contains arsenic, act immediately. **********Mustard gas usually produces ''a very specific clinical picture that is difficult to explain any other way,'' said Dr. Raymond Ten Eyck, who teaches military medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. **********Classically, mustard gas produces an itchy, reddened skin that blisters like a first- or second-degree burn. Mustard gas also causes conjunctivitis, swollen eyelids and blurred vision. Inhalation of the chemical causes coughing and troubled breathing due to destruction of tissue in the respiratory system. If swallowed, mustard gas can produce severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. **********Those who recover may be permanently scarred, breathe with difficulty for the rest of their lives, and have an increased risk of developing cancer. 'No Antidote for Mustard Gas' **********Dr. Yves Alarie, a professor of toxicology at the University of Pittsburgh, said that ''there is no antidote for mustard gas poisoning and once the damage has started, that is it, there is little you can do'' except give supportive care. **********Such emergency steps include shedding the contaminated clothing, cleaning exposed skin and clothes with water, soap and an anti-gas powder such as that consisting of calcium chloride and magnesium oxide. These steps are also taken to prevent new cases among those who aid victims without suspecting that they are contaminated. **********Eyes are rinsed with water for five minutes and the skin blisters are treated as conventional burns with pain killers, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and adequate nutrition. **********The United States Army has developed strips of tape that turn color when they touch clothing and other objects that have been contaminated by chemical warfare agents, Dr. Ten Eyck, the military medicine expert, said. But such tapes do not identify the specific agent. **********Dr. Gustav Drasch's team at the Institut fur Rechtsmedizin in Munich has reported using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify mustard gas in a 24-year-old Iranian soldier who died of mustard gas poisoning. **********Dr. E. R. J. Wils's team at Prins Maurits Laboratory in Rijswijk, Netherlands, has reported using another laboratory method to identify a breakdown product called thiodiglycol in the urine of 25 Iranians who were treated in Europe for mustard gas poisoning. **********But the Dutch team found small amounts of thiodiglycol in urine samples taken from individuals in the Netherlands who were tested for purposes of scientific comparisons but found substantially higher amounts in the Iranians. The source of thiodiglycol in these individuals could not be determined. Some Methods Are Challenged **********Some methods of detecting chemical warfare agents have been refuted or seriously challenged because they have falsely indicated that someone was exposed to a chemical agent, Colonel Dunn said. Because of such problems experts recommended independent confirmation of all samples tested by scientists at another laboratory. **********Still, even when the tests are done reliably, limits to the methodology can preclude conclusive proof of mustard gas poisoning in individual cases. Thus, negative test results may not necessarily disprove chemical warfare poisoning. **********''It is a tricky business,'' said Dr. Willems, who visited the European medical centers to which about 175 Iranian victims of mustard gas attacks were evacuated from 1984 to 1986. **********Dr. Willems said that the diagnosis cannot be made from a single test but is determined from collating data from patients, the environment, when possible, and other sources. After carefully examining the records of 65 of these patients and all other intelligence evidence, Dr. Willems said he concluded that they were victims of mustard gas poisoning. **********Dr. Willems said he had consulted in April in the cases of two Kurds who were evacuated to Brussels with apparent mustard gas poisoning. Dr. Willems said he concluded that they too had mustard gas poisoning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/13/business/briefs-135888.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Air Wis Services Inc., Appleton, Wis., said it would not meet with Cove Capital Associates Inc., to discuss Cove's offer to acquire Air Wis for $16.36 a share. *********** Allis-Chalmers Corp., Milwaukee, a designer and developer of process control equipment, said it had received Bankruptcy Court approval for its agreement to sell its pump business to ITT Corp. for $71 million in cash. *********** Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., said its Bendix Field Engineering Corp. had received a five-year $127 million contract from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to research and develop Navy satellites. *********** General Motors Corp., Detroit, offered incentives of $300 to $750 on 1989 cars and trucks for selected models in its Chevrolet, Pontiac and GMS Truck divisions. *********** Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, said it had received an order from Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to provide all tires for the 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse. *********** Mark IV Industries, West Amherst, N.Y., said it had completed the previously announced acquisition of Armtek Corp., New Haven, for $46 a share in cash, or an indicated value of $561 million. *********** Minerals and Resources Corp., Luxembourg, which is controlled by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd. has raised its stake in Consolidated Gold Fields P.L.C., industry sources said. *********** Shamrock Holdings Inc., Cambridge, Mass., turned up the pressure in its battle to acquire Polaroid Corp., contending in full-page advertisements in The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald that the instant-camera giant is fanning ''fear and concern'' among employees.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/key-rates-035888.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/18/business/careers-expertise-needed-for-cogeneration.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1988-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 889, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Expertise Needed for Cogeneration", "print_headline": "Careers; Expertise Needed for Cogeneration", "body_text": " **********USING a process called cogeneration, a growing number of industrial and commercial plants are cutting millions of dollars from their utility bills. Under the process, the plants produce their own electric power and thermal energy from waste heat - and add to the employment possibilities for technical experts in such widely varying fields as engineering, law, marketing and finance. **********A cogeneration system - a power plant that recycles waste heat that would otherwise escape into the air -can produce both the electricity and the steam needed to operate a factory for the fuel cost of only one of those two types of energy. **********In the past, cogeneration was used mainly in energy-intensive industries like paper and pulp, oil refining, chemicals, food processing, and primary metals. But now that cogeneration systems can be mass-produced, the technology is increasingly being used by schools, hospitals, hotels, shopping centers and restaurants. **********As more and more companies turn to cogeneration, the need grows for the expertise to set up such plants and arrange the financing. ''The major opportunities are for M.B.A.-type people with a finance or marketing specialty or who are skilled in an engineering discipline,'' said Al Smith, chief executive of P.S.E. Inc., a cogeneration developer in Houston. ''You don't have to get it from Harvard - raw experience will do because we are mainly looking for people who are competent.'' **********The National Independent Energy Producers, a Washington-based trade group, estimates that these companies will produce about 15 percent of the nation's electricity by the year 2000. More than 50 percent of the nation's new energy capacity is produced by these independents, of which cogeneration plants account for more than 50 percent; the balance includes solar and windmill power. **********Mr. Smith said that one of the first things he looks for when recruiting employees is a good understanding of the economics of the energy business. ''We need people who know how to take one kind of fuel and convert it into useful types of energy and who can forecast what the energy markets will do,'' he said. **********In 1982, P.S.E. was a small engineering company with about $3 million in revenues. The company reported $145 million in revenues for the first six months of this year, and Mr. Smith expects to reach $250 million by the year's end. **********''One of the most interesting and challenging parts of the job is that it is growing so quickly that we keep having to develop new management systems to oversee our operations,'' Mr. Smith said. ''This is not an easy task and requires a lot of ingenuity.'' **********The energy association estimates that there are 4,000 independent energy projects in the United States either in operation, under construction or in the planning stage. **********The cogeneration industry has been helped by Federal laws that require utilities to purchase the excess power produced by independent producers, whether they need it or not. **********Dennis Bakke, president of Applied Energy Services Inc. of Arlington, Va., said the industry had expanded so rapidly that at least 50 percent of new capacity was being supplied by independent power producers. Mr. Bakke said that Applied Energy, which specializes in solid-fuel cogeneration plants, had 240 employees, compared with just a handful in 1981, when the company was founded. **********About 70 percent of Applied Energy's employees are technicians who operate power plants. They monitor operations at computer boards and keep equipment in working order. College education is not required for the technicians, who earn $25,000 to $40,000 a year. **********The remaining 30 percent of the company's employees are engineers and managers. Mr. Bakke said the company looked for engineers with a mechanical, electrical or chemical background, and was always in the market for an engineer with an M.B.A. degree. Engineers are paid at the going market rate, and M.B.A.'s receive $45,000 to $65,000 a year. **********As the cogeneration industry expands, more lawyers are needed to negotiate agreements with local and state governments, environmental agencies and investment banks. They also negotiate contracts with utilities, which are often reluctant to buy excess electricity, the purchasers of the excess steam, fuel suppliers and the banks that finance the project. **********There are few law firms that specialize in cogeneration power production and even fewer independent lawyers who are familiar with the technology and the diversity of laws that apply to these projects. They must be familiar with regulations involving real estate, banking, securities and the environment. **********''We work with local counsel in about 20 states and it is always difficult to find lawyers with the level of sophistication to negotiate these deals,'' said Martin Klepper, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York. ''If any part of the deal falls out of kilter it knocks down the whole tray of dominoes and the project is not financeable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/03/world/ex-premier-attacks-khomeini-as-despot.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 736, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Premier Attacks Khomeini as Despot", "print_headline": "Ex-Premier Attacks Khomeini as Despot", "body_text": " **********The first Prime Minister appointed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has distributed an open letter of protest accusing the Iranian leader of ''a despotism worthy of the pharaohs'' and of ''collaboration with Israel.'' **********The move by the former official, Mehdi Bazargan, is a dramatic indication of growing oppositionto the Iranian Government and the war with Iraq, which began in 1980. **********Mr. Bazargan, who lives in Teheran, has long been tolerated as a member of the loyal opposition to the Government, primarily because he commands a substantial following among the middle class.

H. Robins bankruptcy case has filed a report indicating that the trustees are deeply divided over many issues critical to the disbursement of a $2.4 billion trust fund for victims of a birth-control device made by Robins. **********The disagreements among the five trustees could delay some payments and also lead to the dismissal of some or all of the trustees. **********The report said that a majority of the trustees believe the group has moved too slowly since it was formed this summer. Several said the trust had become bogged down in discord over such issues as the role to be played by Federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., who has been handling the case; the expenses being incurred by the trust, and the institution that should process the claims. Emergency Claims at Issue **********The bulk of the 195,000 claims from victims of the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine birth control device, cannot be processed until all appeals are exhausted, which could take months. **********But the internal disputes threaten to delay immediate payments from a special $100 million fund for women who might have emergency claims. And the dissension among the five trustees and the slow pace of their deliberations might be used by Judge Merhige as justification to dismiss some or all of them, said several lawyers involved in the case. **********The report was filed under seal late last month in a Federal district court in Richmond by the court-appointed examiner, Ralph Mabey. Late last week it was unsealed and distributed to the participants in the case. Removal of Trustees Sought **********Six California lawyers who represent more than 100 claimants have filed a motion to have all of the trustees removed. The lawyers charged last month that the trustees had failed to act prudently and expeditiously in setting up a claims center and were inexperienced. **********Depositions of several trustees will be taken in the next few days and a hearing on the motion is scheduled for late this month. In conjunction with that motion, Judge Merhige ordered the examiner to file the report on the status of the trustees' work. **********The trust was established this summer as part of Robins's bankruptcy plan. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 after it was flooded with scores of lawsuits charging that use of the Dalkon Shield killed some women and injured thousands more. **********Most of the report consists of Mr. Mabey's rendition of the observations of the trustees and other officials connected to the case, as well as the minutes from the confidential trustee meetings that have been held through the summer. **********The five trustees are three lawyers - Kenneth R. Feinberg, Gene Locks and Stephen A. Saltzburg - and Ann Samani, a Dalkon Shield claimant, and Barbara Blum, president of the Foundation for Child Development. **********The sharpest dissatisfaction from within the group came from Mr. Saltzburg, a Justice Department lawyer and professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. 'Extremely Frustrated' **********''Mr. Saltzburg stated that there was a great deal of dissension among the trustees,'' the report said. ''The trustees were never unanimous on any important issue.'' **********At another point, the report states: ''Mr. Saltzburg is extremely frustrated. The trustees have not accomplished anything significant.'' They have not even drafted bylaws as yet,'' which would establish guidelines for the trust. **********Mr. Saltzburg also complained that the trustees might be spending too much money. According to the report, he said he ''is bitter about reimbursable expenses, such as dinners at the Hay Adams, which he believes strongly are unnecessary.'' The trustees have been meeting regularly in Washington, occasionally at the Hay Adams Hotel. **********Ms. Blum told the court examiner that the trustees ''were quite divided concerning what the court's involvement should be.'' She and another trustee also strongly criticized the decision to retain an administrator for the center that handles the claims. He is drawing a salary and other benefits that total about $1 million over five years, the report said. **********Ann Peters, a deputy clerk for the same bankrupty court who was instrumental in setting up the claims center, told the examiner that she was ''really negative'' about the trustees, and declined to work for an organization that ''won't grab the day-to-day things and do something with them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/01/business/advertising-uproar-over-the-whittle-proposal.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Uproar Over The Whittle Proposal", "print_headline": "Advertising; Uproar Over The Whittle Proposal", "body_text": " **********CHRISTOPHER WHITTLE, whose plans to dominate the reading material in the waiting rooms of doctors' offices has other magazine publishers in an uproar, predicted yesterday that the debut of his six magazines in late September would be ''the most successful magazine launch in history.'' **********The magazines will have first-year gross advertising revenues of $37.5 million, he said, noting that about 10 major multi-product companies have bought almost all of the available 30 advertising packages. **********None of that has upset the advertising community. What has other publishers furious is the deal Whittle Communications, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., says it has with the physicians. Whittle says that as a condition of getting the publications, the physicians have agreed to eliminate all but two other titles from their waiting rooms. **********John Beni, president of Gruner + Jahr, USA, just one of the publishers who is upset about the Whittle proposal, said his people had checked about 300 physicians coast to coast and not one had heard of the Whittle proposal. He also said that he could not find a major advertiser that had definitely signed up. **********But Mr. Whittle said yesterday in a telephone interview that physicians were being signed up at a better rate than they were in a 1,000-physician national test last fall. **********He is interested in physicians in family practice, OB/GYN and pediatrics, specialties that attract young mothers with growing families, the heaviest spenders for package goods, which is the biggest advertiser category. **********Mr. Whittle is not saying whether he is charging the physicians for the magazines or if he is, how much. He says it could go from being free to $200 a year. For that amount, doctors will get quarterly magazines on the family, health, living, sports, personalities and fiction, which are being produced under the directon of William Rukeyser, who was editor of Fortune. Each is labeled Special Report, with the subject matter below it. **********The magazines, which are 10 1/2 by 14 inches, have covers made with heavy paper stock so that they can withstand a lot of handling. Despite the heavy covers, Mr. Whittle is promising physicians that his field staff that maintains the magazine stands will bring in five new copies of each magazine monthly. **********Advertisers, who are paying $1.25 million for a year's participation for each brand, are given exclusivity for the category with the same ad running in each of the six publications. That is a lot of money for relatively small circulation. However, advertisers will be receiving a lot of readers in a non-competitive atmosphere, something that is almost impossible to find these days. **********Since television became the dominant national advertising medium, magazines have been using total audience rather than mere circulation as a yardstick for selling advertising, building up those important readers-per-copy totals with distribution in doctors' offices, airlines, barber shops and other public places. **********Some magazines like American Health and Rodale's Prevention have special programs aimed at physicians. Mr. Beni's company owns both Parents and Expecting magazines, the latter only available in obstetricians' offices. **********Mr. Beni said he was not in a position to take any legal action until Mr. Whittle actually publishes something. Then, he said, he will seriously consider it. **********He has already written a letter from Parents magazine to the same 15,000 physicians Whittle Communications is aiming at. Another letter is going next week from Expecting, which has almost all of its circulation through doctors' offices. **********Whittle, whose presentation for the concept expresses a desire to ''dominate available reading time in environments, lock up valuable real estate and become an 'institution' over time,'' and whose advertising in the trade press has been inflammatory, has infuriated other publishers. So much so that Mr. Whittle was asked to appear before the board of the Magazine Publishers of America, of which his company is a member, to explain his plans. Speaking in opposition to him was Owen Lipstein, president of American Health, 10 percent of whose circulation of one million is to doctors' offices. **********Donald D. Kummerfeld, president of the M.P.A., said the board had been surprised when Mr. Whittle said he would not put pressure on his field force to eliminate all but two other magazines from the waiting rooms, despite talk to the contrary. **********The field force is already in place because, in addition to publishing Physicians Weekly with 70,000 circulation, Whittle has its ''Wall Medium,'' a poster with advertising that helps promote an advertiser-supported health-care brochure giveaway that changes according to the physician's specialty. **********Doctors' waiting rooms are particularly attractive to publishers. For the last year Newsweek has produced Newsweek on Health, a special edition containing reprints on that topic. Smithsonian is preparing for the first time to make a special pitch for waiting room subscriptions. **********And Robert Riordan, president of Family Media, which has 10 titles including Field & Stream and Discover, is serious enough about putting out a special magazine containing articles from all the others specifically for waiting rooms that he has made presentations to major advertisers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/business/the-media-business-both-macmillan-suitors-raise-the-ante.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1988-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 812, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Both Macmillan Suitors Raise the Ante", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Both Macmillan Suitors Raise the Ante", "body_text": " **********In quick succession yesterday, the two rival bidders for Macmillan Inc. announced higher takeover offers for the publishing and information services company. **********Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm that is an ally of Macmillan's management, raised its offer to $90.05 a share in cash and notes, from $85, putting the deal's value near $2.5 billion. **********The new Kohlberg, Kravis offer topped a bid made public just hours earlier by Robert Maxwell, the British entrepreneur, who had raised his bid to $89 a share, from $86.80. **********Mr. Maxwell did not indicate whether he would raise his offer, which is being made through the Maxwell Communications Corporation. But Macmillan, under its chairman, Edward P. Evans, has appeared intent on preventing a Maxwell takeover. **********For Mr. Maxwell, a defeat would represent his second setback in a little more than a year for an American publisher. Last year Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. undertook a costly recapitalization plan to thwart his takeover efforts. **********So bitter has the latest battle become that Mr. Maxwell complained publicly yesterday that he was ''shocked'' by the handling of the Macmillan bidding. **********But Mr. Evans, who has run Macmillan, which is based in New York, for the last nine years, said he thought the bidding procedure had been ''conducted extremely fairly.'' **********In the latest round of bidding Macmillan has also given Kohlberg, Kravis what amounts to a ''crown jewel'' provision. According to a person close to the negotiations, if the company is sold to a higher bidder, the buyout firm has the right to acquire four Macmillan operations, presumably at pre-agreed prices: the Macmillan Book Clubs operations, Macmillan's reference books, the Berlitz language schools, and Michie, a state legal code publisher.

By that time, Mr. Maxwell had already raised his bid to $89, though the higher offer had not been publicly announced. When Mr. Pirie asked for more time because his client was in England, Mr. Wasserstein extended the deadline to midnight. **********By this account, Mr. Pirie later said to Mr. Wasserstein: ''If you have a bid higher than ours, tell us, and we can say whether we will go higher or stop here.'' However, Mr. Wasserstein called back and said he would not disclose whether Kohlberg, Kravis had raised its bid. There was no further contact between the parties until Mr. Pirie learned of the new Kohlberg, Kravis offer from the newswires. **********But people close to Wasserstein, Parella said that that Mr. Pirie ultimately made the Maxwell bid public himself by calling the Dow Jones news wire yesterday morning. **********Mr. Maxwell said yesterday that he was ''shocked that the board of directors of Macmillan would enter into this hasty, ill-conceived, front-end-loaded, two-tier junk bond-financed offer with KKR without even contacting me.'' **********The battle for Macmillan started in June when the Robert M. Bass Group offered $64 a share for the company. The company responded with a restructuring plan, which the Bass Group blocked before bowing out of the fight.

Eisen, senior vice president for Cushman & Wakefield, a national real estate brokerage company. ''The vacancy rate there is about 14 percent. That compares favorably with the rest of Bergen County, where the rate is between 20 and 22 percent, depending on where you look.'' **********The main factor in this distinction, he said, is Fort Lee's location. **********''Fort Lee has what can be called front door and back door accessibility,'' he said.

Most of the new space will be in an 800,000-square-foot structure of 28 stories that will be the region's tallest speculative office building. **********''Fort Lee is like every other location - it has its ups and downs,'' he said. ''But what has helped to keep things consistent is that we have not had to rely on financial service companies or even corporate tenants as much as the rest of Bergen or Morris Counties have. Fort Lee has always had a much broader base of tenant.'' **********The smaller of Mr. Poskanzer's current projects and the one closest to completion is a 220,000-square-foot building developed in partnership with Lloyd Tulp. The seven-story structure is on the east side of Fletcher Avenue (Route 9W) just past the toll plaza of the George Washington Bridge. About $22 a square foot is asked for space in the building.

The office park, with 26 acres, is the largest development parcel in Fort Lee. It already holds 600,000 square feet of space in two buildings. The park, situated at the juncture of Interstate 80 and Route 4, is fully leased and has attracted a mix of tenants, among them local companies like G.S.&J.

Completion of this parking facility is pivotal in the next stage of construction because the new office tower will rise on land that now provides the main parking for the complex. **********The firm of Henry Horowitz & Associates is the architect for the new office tower, which will be known as Three Executive Drive. The building will have a facade of buff-colored unpolished granite and will have gray-tinted glass windows. The office floors will average 30,000 square feet. **********The building's mechanical and data system will be contained in a separate structure. The 60,000-square-foot data center, which will hold the electric, heating, air-conditioning, security and telecommunications systems for the new office building, is under construction. **********The second level of the building's atrium lobby will hold about 10,000 square feet of retail space for a restaurant, newsstand and shoeshine concession and various shops.

Kramer, a lawyer and editor for the Research Institute of America who specializes in pension plans and employee benefits. **********Mr. Kramer, who is also a member of the tax committee of the American Bar Association, advises that businesses immediately begin reviewing their pension plans and make any adjustments needed to put them into compliance with the tax provisions that take effect next year. **********In general, the new provisions are intended to reduce the disparity of benefits among employees. Mr. Kramer said that most employers with plans that are ''integrated with Social Security'' had not been required to make contributions or provide benefits for many lower-paid workers. Beginning in 1989, employers with such plans will have to provide some coverage for those employees, he said. Providing that coverage will raise costs. Other provisions concern ''vesting,'' or guaranteeing employees that they will be entitled to accrued benefits even if they leave the company. **********The changes in the law will be particularly significant for small- and medium-sized companies that bought packaged pension plans years ago, said Sid Weinman, senior editor for the Research Institute, which publishes newsletters and provides information services on taxes and pensions for financial planners, accountants and lawyers. **********Large corporations generally have pension and benefit specialists who are aware of the new requirements, Mr. Kramer said, but many smaller businesses, and corporations formed by professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants, do not. Moreover, these corporations frequently have separate pension plans for the professionals and for other employees, a situation that may violate the new provisions. **********Employers should consult an accountant, lawyer or financial planner to determine whether they need to make changes in their pension plans. Some employers might benefit from the advice of a bank, brokerage house, insurance company or other financial institution where experts are likely to be amending their plans to conform to the new rules. **********If the I.R.S. determines that an employer is operating a plan that does not comply with the new law, the company will lose its tax deduction for the pension plan, Mr. Kramer said. **********These are among the key pension provisions: *********** The ground rules of the various vesting systems will be revised. The system that provides vesting after 10 years of employment will be changed to 5 years. An alternative that provides a vesting formula of 5 to 15 years will be changed to 3 to 7 years. The type of vesting known as ''class year'' will be eliminated. *********** Broader, more inclusive coverage of employees is required. Coverage will be subject to numerical formulas to reduce discrimination. The formulas will offer three alternatives: plans will have to benefit at least 70 percent of the employees who rank in the lowest two-thirds in terms of compensation; the percentage of these employees in the lowest two-thirds of compensation must equal at least 70 percent of the more highly compensated employees who are covered; or the ''average benefit percentage'' for the lower-compensated employees must be at least 70 percent of the ''average benefit percentage'' for the more highly paid. *********** A plan must benefit 50 employees or 40 percent or more of all employees, whichever is less. Previously, no minimum participation was required. *********** Plans integrated with Social Security will be restricted in offering larger benefits for more highly compensated employees. For a defined contribution plan, the contribution rate above the Social Security wage base of $45,000 cannot be more than twice the rate below that level. For example, if contributions are made at a 5 percent rate for pay above $45,000, they must also be made at 2.5 percent below that amount. Previously no contributions had to be made for employees earning less than the maximum subject to Social Security. *********** Defined-benefit plans will be subject to minimum funding rules requiring quarterly, rather than annual, contributions. For calendar-year plans, the contributions must be made by April 15, July 15, Aug. 15 and Jan. 15 of the following year. For fiscal-year plans the due dates are the 15th of the corresponding months. *********** Several new rules will limit an employer's flexibility in setting up and administering the popular 401(K) deferred-compensation plans. Restrictions apply to distributions and hardship withdrawals, the length of service required to join the plan and employer contributions. **********Other rules that take effect next year will affect minimum financing and length-of-service requirements and will prevent plans from increasing benefits for those with compensation over $200,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/20/world/lebanese-held-by-west-germany-convicted-in-beirut-hostage-case.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1988-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanese Held by West Germany Convicted in Beirut Hostage Case", "print_headline": "Lebanese Held by West Germany Convicted in Beirut Hostage Case", "body_text": " **********One of two Lebanese brothers charged in West Germany with terrorist acts was found guilty today and sentenced to 13 years in prison - more than the prosecution had sought - for taking two Germans hostage in Beirut. **********The man, Abbas Ali Hamadei, who is 29 years old, clapped his hands in evident surprise as the presiding judge, Klaus Arend, announced the verdict.

If sentenced as a minor, he would be liable to at most 10 years in prison instead of the life sentence he faces as an adult on the charges of murder and air piracy. **********The stern judgment of the Dusseldorf court today seemed to signal the determination of the German judiciary to act firmly with the Hamadeis. **********Judge Arend said that the court routinely confronted many serious crimes, but that terrorism was something entirely different. Innocent people were killed or kept in inhuman conditions, he said, out of somebody's ''obsession with changing the world.'' **********''The only thing which can fight naked violence is the impartial application of justice,'' he said. **********The court said that Abbas and Mohammed Hamadei arrived in Frankfurt on Jan. 13, 1987, carrying seven bottles of the explosive methyl nitrate. **********Mohammed Hamadei was picked up with three bottles at the airport. The court said Abbas Hamadei hid his four bottles and returned to Beirut, where he became involved in the planning to press Bonn not to extradite Mohammed Hamadei to the United States, which led to the decision to kidnap Mr. Cordes and Mr. Schmidt. **********The most damaging evidence cited by the court was a letter from Mr. Schmidt to his mother on which the police found Abbas Hamadei's fingerprints, and several tapped telephone conversations between Abbas Hamadei and accomplices in which he appeared to have a detailed knowledge of what was happening with the hostages. **********Abbas Hamadei was arrested on Jan. 26, 1987, on his return to Frankfurt, and eventually led the police to the explosives he had hidden. Though he never challenged the charge of smuggling explosives, he pleaded innocent to the more serious charge of kidnapping the hostages.  U.S. APPLAUDS VERDICT **********WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The United States applauded the conviction and 13-year sentence handed to Abbas Hamadei today. **********''We commend today's action by the German court, which sends a clear signal to terrorists,'' said Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman. ''We believe that strong punishment for terrorists is essential.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/business/the-media-business-advertising-ad-campaign-to-tell-what-us-magazine-is.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad Campaign to Tell What US Magazine Is", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Ad Campaign to Tell What US Magazine Is", "body_text": " **********US magazine is beginning a lighthearted year-long trade campaign today, aimed at dispelling notions people may have of the magazine. **********A black-and-white spread in publications like Advertising Age, Adweek and Marketing and Media Decisions says US readers do not live in trailer parks or buy art at supermarkets. **********The headline reads, ''Definitely Not US,'' while the tagline says, ''Definitely a different kind of entertainment magazine.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/22/world/jerusalem-journal-palestinians-bete-noire-how-will-he-play-in-us.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1988-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; Palestinians' Bete Noire: How Will He Play in U.S.?", "print_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; Palestinians' Bete Noire: How Will He Play in U.S.?", "body_text": " **********Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is to leave this week for a visit to the United States, where he will meet with senior Government officials and leaders of American Jewish organizations. By Mr. Rabin's own account, ''I'm not expecting very much applause.'' **********If his standing is particularly low among some Americans right now, it is unusually high among many Israelis, and for the same reason: his tough approach to quelling the six-month-old Palestinian uprising. **********A commentary in the daily newspaper Haaretz last week dubbed him ''No. 1 in the Government'' and ''the real prime minister.'' The newspaper pointed out that his handling of the uprising has generated enthusiastic support from a broad array of Israelis with diverse political affiliations. **********But in Washington, only 48 hours after the commentary was published, the State Department criticized Mr. Rabin, though not by name, because of his directive June 12 authorizing civilians to shoot on sight anyone seen holding a firebomb. ''We believe that Israeli citizens should not have the power to insure law and order,'' the State Department said. Explains to U.S. Embassy **********Mr. Rabin said he spoke to officials in the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv to explain his view. A firebomb, he told them, is a lethal weapon, like a rifle. But hardly anyone in Israel questioned that it was permissible to shoot someone holding a firebomb. **********By virtually all accounts, he combines the two things that polls show most Israelis want. **********Israelis overwhelmingly favor the use of what some polls refer to as heavy-handed force against violent Palestinians. That attitude, said a senior aide to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, is a reflection of Israelis' ''basic frustration, humiliation and hatred of the Arabs.'' **********Mr. Rabin is the architect of Israel's ''force, might, beatings'' policy in the occupied territories. **********At the same time, polls show that 60 percent or more favor giving up parts of the occupied territories in exchange for peace. That is the Labor Party position, and as a party leader Mr. Rabin wholeheartedly supports it. **********The two positions may seem contradictory, but Israelis insist they are not. Put the uprising down today, then compromise for peace tomorrow, some Israeli officials say. **********''I don't see any contradiction at all,'' Mr. Rabin said. **********Some in the United States were surprised when Mr. Peres, the Labor Party leader and Mr. Rabin's traditional political rival, expressed strong support last month for the Defense Minister's policies in the territories. **********Although they are longtime bitter rivals, Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres no longer have unkind words for one another in public. Some in the Labor Party say that earlier public acrimony between the two leaders was partly responsible for Labor's loss in the last election. Mr. Rabin and Mr. Rabin now meet every Sunday morning so that they do not cross each other up in public. **********''They hammer out the line,'' an aide to Mr. Peres said. **********''They coordinate some attitudes,'' an aide to Mr. Rabin said. **********As a result, ''I don't think there are any basic differences between us,'' Mr. Rabin said. Mr. Peres says the same thing. **********When he and Mr. Peres meet, Mr. Rabin said, ''we discuss his role in the search for peace and my role in coping with the violence in the territories.'' **********Last week, when the Labor Party selected its list of candidates for the parliamentary elections in the fall, Mr. Peres shifted Mr. Rabin from the No. 3 position to No. 2. That infuriated Deputy Prime Minister Yitzhak Navon, who had been promised the No. 2 slot. But aides to Mr. Peres said there was no choice and not much debate. **********''They need each other now,'' an aide said. ''They're twins,'' another said. All of that plays well enough here, but Mr. Rabin is preparing for a difficult visit in Washington. His main purpose, he said, is to meet with White House, State Department and Defense Department officials to discuss military aid and cooperation. **********But while there, he said, ''there is no doubt that people will want to hear from me what I see as the situation in the territories and the way in which we are conducting events in the territories.'' **********He added, ''There is a need to explain why we have been forced to do what we have done.'' **********The comment attributed to him in January that the army would put down the uprising with ''force, might, beatings,'' has dogged him ever since. **********The comment, he said, was printed ''to the best of my memory, completely out of context.'' **********He said that the Hebrew word he had used, ''makot,'' can mean either ''hitting'' or ''beating,'' and that he had meant hitting. **********While he may disavow the comment as translated, neither he nor other members of the Government from either major party excuse the policy. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir endorsed it, and senior members of the military explained it to their subordinates. **********The announcement of the policy was followed by a rash of reports that soldiers beat and clubbed Palestinians, leaving them with broken arms, legs, cracked ribs and other injuries. 'Had to Use Force' **********Those reports have diminished lately, as has the violence. ''We could not give in to force,'' Mr. Rabin said last week. ''We had to use force in return. And force includes whatever means are necessary to cope with the violence. I don't believe police forces in any city in the United States would use any different means.'' **********He added, ''I was trying to shift away from more lethal means,'' such as firing live ammunition. **********In Israel, Mr. Rabin is better known for the secret meetings he has been holding with Palestinian leaders, trying to find out what is on their minds and how the uprising might be brought to an end. ''Since I am the government in the territories,'' he said, ''they deserve the right to talk to me and me to them.'' **********Some on Israel's political right, including Haim Kauffman, chairman of the Likud bloc, are demanding that the meetings be stopped, saying they give legitimacy to the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********But the United States favors the meetings. And from Washington in the last few days, Mr. Rabin has heard some warm words of praise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/24/business/company-news-portable-macintosh-details-published.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Portable Macintosh Details Published", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Portable Macintosh Details Published", "body_text": " **********A trade journal published this week contains thorough details of Apple Computer Inc.'s portable Macintosh personal computer - a serious breach of internal security.

He had just completed a six-hour drive from Baton Rouge, La., and tomorrow he would drive to Tucson, Ariz., and another rodeo. **********Kyle Whiting, a 26-year-old cowboy, pulled into an Astrodome parking lot two weeks ago for the start of the Houston rodeo shortly before his event, the bull ride. He had just completed a six-hour drive from Baton Rouge, La., and tomorrow he would drive to Tucson, Ariz., and another rodeo. **********But now, in front of 30,000 spectators, he waited tensely in the chutes atop a 2,000-pound bull. He had paid a $257 entry fee, but if he rode the bull for eight seconds, scored high and advanced to the finals, he could win $63,000. **********Dirt flew as the chute opened and the bull stormed out - ''like grabbing a train traveling 40 miles an hour,'' said one cowboy of trying to hold on during a bull's first lunge. For several seconds Mr. Whiting was in control, his left hand gripping a rope strapped to the bull's shoulders, but he soon slid backwards. He hung on desperately until he finally lost his balance and flipped off, his body folded like a lawn chair in winter. The ride lasted seven seconds. ''If a guy can hang on another second, he can win a lot of money,'' Mr. Whiting said minutes later, scraping dirt from his shirt. Each second will mean a lot of money today at the finals of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Two weeks of riding bulls and broncos, wrestling steers, roping calves, racing chuck wagons and - for women - racing horses around barrels have winnowed 826 entrants to 60 cowboys and 12 cowgirls. They will compete for $350,000, the largest rodeo purse in the country. **********Traditionally, rodeos have offered meager pickings compared with the rich rewards of many professional sports. Cowboys on average still earn far less than professional stock-car racers, tennis players or golfers. But rodeo prize money - thanks to increases in corporate sponsorship - has risen significantly, to $15 million last year, from $7 million in 1977. Top competitors, like the saddle bronc rider Lewis Feild, the steer wrestler Lance Robinson and the barrel racer Charmayne James, have earned as much as $160,000 in recent years, from a top of $50,000 in 1975. **********At the same time, today's star performers fatten their bank accounts with lucrative endorsements for blue jeans, belt buckles, tobacco and other products linked to the cowboy image. **********These higher stakes are changing the face of the rodeo by attracting younger competitors. Still in their early 20's, they come not only from ranches but from small towns, cities, and colleges. They are not just Westerners. And they are better trained, better educated, more skilled and often more financially sophisticated than the veteran ranch hands who competed 25 years ago. **********Few of today's rodeo cowboys would be at home on the range. Even the clowns carry business cards. **********But the rodeo circuit is still a tough way to make a living. The professional Rodeo Cowboys Association says that of its 6,000 full-time members, only the top 105 who make it to the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nev., in December are likely to end the year in the black. There about 300 full-time members of the Women's Professional Rodeo Association; only the top 40 are likely to turn a profit. **********''I've been broke in every state in the country,'' said Joel Montgomery, a former bareback and saddle bronc rider who quit the circuit several years ago after breaking both arms and separating a shoulder. He has since worked in the construction industry and is trying his hand as a songwriter. When he quit the rodeo, he recalled, ''it was tough being out of the spotlight, even though you could make more money laying bricks.'' **********Though most performers find the going rough, top cowboys are beginning to cash in. National giants like the Coca-Cola Company and the Anheuser-Busch Companies, as well as mom-and-pop local retailers, have poured money into rodeos through cash prizes, premiums, advertising and marketing. Corporate sponsorship has risen from to $11.5 million in 1987, from $900,000 a decade ago. **********''People like to identify with cowboys,'' said Tom Collins, a spokesman for Wrangler, the biggest sponsor of professional rodeo. This year the company will donate $330,000 in prize money and will spend $3 million on advertising and sponsorship of the rodeo circuit. ''There's a lot of hero worship involved with cowboys,'' he added. ''They make good role models as well as fashion models.'' **********Wrangler's support of professional rodeo is part of a broader marketing trend in which companies pay to sponsor events and conduct on-site promotions. These events range from college football games to dog-sled races, and also include rock concerts, county fairs and art exhibits. According to Special Events Report, a Chicago newsletter, 3,700 corporations will spend $1.75 billion in special events marketing this year, a 420 percent dollar increase over five years ago. **********This rise is partly credited to event organizers who have recruited corporate sponsors to keep ticket prices down in the face of rising costs. But the increase is also the result of corporate concern about advertising messages getting lost amid the commercial clutter on the airwaves and in print. **********Rodeo advertising offers several advantages. For one, rodeo spectators are predisposed to buy products with a Western orientation. The Chrysler Corporation, for example, markets Dodge trucks at rodeos. (It promotes the Dodge Dynasty, a sleek luxury car, at gymnastic competitions that draw more affluent suburban residents.) Rodeos also reach small markets that advertisers have difficulty penetrating otherwise. About 13 million people attended professional rodeos last year in more than 600 cities, from Coulee City, Wash., to East Greenwich, R.I., to Titusville, Fla. **********''Television advertising will not necessarily build consumer loyalty,'' said Ken Stemler, senior partner at Starsportse, a sports marketing company in Colorado Springs. ''That loyalty comes through involvement in something the consumer enjoys, like rodeo. You plant in his mind the obligation to buy.'' **********At the Houston rodeo two weeks ago, the action riveted spectators to their seats, creating a captive audience for product pitches. A huge video screen in the Astrodome plays commercials for Continental Airlines. A photograph of icy Bud Light beer cans is splashed across the cover of every program. The words ''Dodge Truck'' are printed on the leg coverings of rodeo officials on horseback. One announcer, Bob Tallman, is also on horseback. His boots are pink, the better to call attention to the the handiwork of the Justin Boot Company. Mr. Tallman also intones corporate names over the public address system. During the barrel racing, he booms ''The Wrangler girl!'' when Holly Foster, 20 years old, dashes around the barrels, her long blond hair flying out behind her hat. Miss Foster has received $20,000 from Wrangler to appear in ads endorsing the company's blue jeans. **********Not many cowboys alternated as fashion models during the early days of rodeo. The sport began in the second half of the 19th century when cowboys from different trail rides gathered in towns and placed bets on roping and riding competitions. Soon townspeople were buying tickets, and by 1912 a few cattlemen were underwriting the events, offering $1,000 in prize money and making small profits from entry fees and ticket sales. From this, the professional rodeo circuit gradually evolved. Its popularity grew after the ''Urban Cowboy'' craze in the early 1980's, and ESPN, the cable TV sports network, has given the rodeo wider exposure, although the major networks have shown little interest. **********The early rodeo cowboys were mostly tough, sun-weathered ranch hands who competed as a hobby. But now, ''daddy's money,'' as old-time cowboys contemptuously say, is often paying for an offspring's rodeo lessons, horses, equipment, memberships in a growing number of amateur associations and finally, expenses on the professional circuit. **********The rodeo cowboy, in fact, has become not just glamorous but respectable. ''If a young boy can make $100,000 in rodeo, it's acceptable to parents,'' said J.R. Hejl, a Houston insurance man who competed on the rodeo circuit from 1969 to 1976, but quit after breaking four ribs, his neck and his collarbone. **********''They're now getting $40,000 for a single bull ride,'' he went on. ''In my day, I used to make $40,000 for the entire year, and I rode everything with hair on it.'' **********Jerome Robinson, a professional bull rider from 1970 to 1982 and now a stock contractor who supplies rodeo animals, said larger purses had improved the cowboys' itinerant lifestyle. ''We used to stay in cheap motels,'' he said. ''As our income increased, we stayed in Holiday Inns, and by the time I quit, the top cowboys were staying at the Marriott and flying first class.'' It is the nomadic lifestyle - from highway motels to desolate travel parks, from sleepy Montana cowtowns to loud, sprawling cities in Texas - that satisfies cowboys' traditional wanderlust. Today, it also approximates the freedom and independence supposedly enjoyed by the Texas cowboys of the great 19th century cattle drives. **********But bruising competition and thousands of miles of travel exact a toll in broken bones and broken marriages. Among veterans, professional rodeo is known as the ''suicide circuit.'' **********A full-time cowboy will enter from 50 to 75 rodeos a year and spend up to 45 weeks on the road. Mr. Feild, the star saddle bronc rider who pocketed $150,000 last year, and other ''rough stock'' riders who compete on bulls and broncos crisscross the country by airplane. The animals on which they compete are supplied by contractors. But calf wrestlers, steer ropers and barrel racers must provide their own horses, confining them - and the animals - to road travel. **********Cowboys cut road costs by traveling in small groups. Even so, ''it takes a lot of money to go down the road,'' said Russell Solberg, a steer wrestler from Los Angeles. Fuel, lodging and horse feed can quickly deplete a cowboy's winnings. ''If you're not winning, you eat at McDonald's,'' said Mr. Solberg, who also works as a Hollywood stuntman to make ends meet. ''You get a steak occasionally and remember the taste.'' **********The problem for rodeo cowboys is that they have huge fixed costs and no guaranteed income. Unlike most professional athletes, cowboys pay to perform - entry fees usually range from $100 to $275 for each event in a rodeo - and they only receive money if they win. **********Worse, unlike stockcar racers, tennis players and golfers, cowboys usually cannot win big chunks of money at a single rodeo because the purse is divided among winners of six or seven events. Also unlike other athletes, few cowboys are backed by syndicates. Only occasionally will someone get money ''from a rich guy who needs a tax break,'' said Jimmy Hodge, a 25-year-old cowboy from Stephenville, Tex. **********Fortunately, prize money is not the sole source of income for many rodeo performers. Cowboys who own horses can lend them out for use on the circuit, then collect one-fourth of the rider's winnings. The animals appreciate in value if their riders win, so skilled calf wrestlers and steer ropers try to buy horses cheap, win a few large purses, then sell the animals at big markups. **********When it comes time to quit, most cowboys leave the sport reluctantly. Many look for rodeo-related jobs - training horses, teaching or buying and selling stock. Others buy a suit and tie and try the business world. **********Injuries shorten many careers. Through their professional association, cowboys are insured for $12,500 for each injury. Every year a few injuries are fatal. (In July Malcolm Baldrige, the Commerce Secretary in the Reagan Administration, died when his horse fell on him while he was practicing for a steer-roping competition in Northern California.) Still, the cowboys go on - for adventure, glory, perhaps money, even salvation. **********Eugene Weldon, a 28-year-old calf roper, is a born-again Christian who believes he has a spiritual calling to minister to rodeo cowboys. Mr. Weldon, who offers nondenominational services without charge, concedes that cowboys are better known for drinking Jack Daniels and chasing short skirts than for attending prayer meetings. But ''Jesus said to go into all parts of the world, and this is one of those parts,'' he explained two weeks ago in Houston. He continues on the circuit with his wife Sadie. ''We didn't win any money at this rodeo, but praise the Lord, we're going on to the next one,'' he said. **********Most cowboys will make it to the next one. Others will do the best they can. A note hangs on the bulletin board backstage at the Astrodome: ''Kenny Taton needs a ride to Snyder Tx. Or close.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/20/world/sweden-s-police-chief-quits-over-unsolved-palme-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sweden's Police Chief Quits Over Unsolved Palme Case", "print_headline": "Sweden's Police Chief Quits Over Unsolved Palme Case", "body_text": " **********Sweden's police chief, Niels Erik Ahmansson, resigned today after the country's Attorney General criticized him for incompetence in the unsolved killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme. **********Mr. Ahmansson's fate was sealed after the Attorney General, Hans Stark, said in an official report made public today that he doubted whether the police chief should stay on. **********Mr. Ahmansson is the latest high-level victim in the attempt to find the gunman who killed Mr. Palme on Feb. 28, 1986.

Producers of nondurable goods recorded a rise of one-tenth of a percentage point, to 86.5 percent. **********The Fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the increase came at steel mills. **********Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fourth consecutive month, to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in the production of light trucks. But automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to 76.7 percent from 77 percent. Rise in Utility Operating Rate **********The operating rate at utilities was 81 percent in November, up from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use for air-conditioning. **********In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6 percent in October. **********The Fed's production index has not declined since September 1987. Production in the manufacturing sector rose five-tenths of 1 percent in November, following an even stronger gain of six-tenths in October. **********Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, down slightly from October. But production of business equipment rose four-tenths of 1 percent following a flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago. **********Output at mines and oil wells rose by six-tenths of 1 percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased four-tenths, on top of a jump of six-tenths in October. **********Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/07/business/market-place-a-cautious-attitude-at-pennzoil.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1988-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1004, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; A Cautious Attitude At Pennzoil", "print_headline": "Market Place; A Cautious Attitude At Pennzoil", "body_text": " **********ONE major uncertainty will end for the Pennzoil Company and its stockholders today, and another will begin, when Texaco Inc. transfers $3 billion by wire to a Houston bank, the price of peace in their long-running corporate legal war. **********It took four years to settle the fight over what three Texas courts ruled was Texaco's unlawful interference with Pennzoil's plan to merge with the Getty Oil Company. Now it could easily be two more years before the scale of a new, larger Pennzoil is completed. It is now the nation's 25th-largest oil and gas company, with $3.3 billion in assets. **********Pennzoil will have $2.6 billion from the settlement after expenses, compared with a current market value of $3.15 billion. J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that he would not act quickly to make a major acquisition or any other investment. ''We are not going to just plunge madly ahead,'' he said. **********No investment bankers are working now with Pennzoil, although some consulting firms are studying various parts of the energy industry for a top-level strategy team at the company, Mr. Liedtke said. In the two weeks since a Federal bankruptcy court in White Plains approved the Texaco settlement, Pennzoil has bought $2.6 billion in short-term securities with money borrowed from several banks in anticipation of receiving the cash today. From that point, interest income will enrich Pennzoil by $600,000 a day, another inducement for Mr. Liedtke to take his time. **********Analysts believe a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over how much of the settlement is taxable, if it develops, may take years to resolve. Pennzoil believes it can hold the money at least until 1991 with no tax liability. Its position is that the Texaco payment is cash that was, in legal terms, ''involuntarily converted'' from the billion barrels of Getty oil reserves Pennzoil sought to acquire. **********Meanwhile, analysts said, Mr. Liedtke could put together as much as $10 billion for a takeover attempt that only the major international oil companies could elude. ''The man could buy almost anything he wants in the hydrocarbon business,'' said Marc D. Cohen, a senior analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York. **********That clout has made Pennzoil the first checkpoint of speculation now among investors and analysts when an oil company is rumored to be the object of a pending takeover campaign. Phillips Petroleum, Unocal, Amerada Hess and Sun are major domestic producers often mentioned as candidates. **********''Quite a few buyers'' have bid prices higher for proven reserves in recent months, said Frederick P. Leuffer, senior oil analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York. He added, though, that the field was not crowded in the range where Mr. Liedtke was capable of bidding. **********Mr. Liedtke, however, strongly indicated that he would not bid for anything this year. Rising interest rates could spell trouble for the economy and drive stock prices lower, he said, adding that better buying conditions were likely in 1989. ''I would like to see how the economy does after the first of the year,'' he said. He added that he believed oil prices would not go any higher than $20 a barrel this year. **********Mr. Liedtke, who was 66 years old in February, said he would remain chairman and direct major policy matters after the chief executive's post is given to Randal B. McDonald, president and chief operating officer, at Pennzoil's annual meeting in Houston on April 28. **********Pennzoil has little interest in bidding for any companies not engaged in natural resource businesses, Mr. Liedtke said. He also rejected speculation that he and other aging Pennzoil directors might prefer selling the company, especially if energy prices remained depressed. ''I don't think we'd be interested,'' he said. **********Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said Pennzoil shares could bring as much as $110. Mr. Liedtke, who co-founded Pennzoil and has been its only chairman, owns stock worth $29 million. ''If someone comes along and offers him the right price, I think he'll sell,'' Mr. Jacoboski said.  Pennzoil shares closed at $76, up $1, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Leuffer and Mr. Cohen said they doubted Pennzoil would put itself on the auction block. The company adopted anti-takeover provisions shortly after a Houston jury awarded it a $10.53 billion judgment against Texaco in November 1985. **********The two analysts recently advised investors to sell their shares. They estimated Pennzoil would earn about $4.25 a share this year, including about $2.25 a share after taxes from interest income on the Texaco settlement. **********Pennzoil's most profitable unit is its motor oil division. which markets the nation's best-selling motor oil. It also operates a sulfur company and a gold-mining company as well as oil and gas production from its proven reserves, equivalent to 300 million barrels of oil. **********Mr. Liedtke said he was keeping an open mind about how Pennzoil might expand, or reshape itself in other ways. For instance, it could easily decide to sell or spin off any or all of its operations, which were separated into independent units two years ago for that purpose. Pennzoil could become a major oil company by bidding for both reserves and refining capacity, but Mr. Liedtke said he was uncertain about how much should be foreign or domestic. **********A strategy session to comb through these issues with Pennzoil directors is set for several days early in June, he said. ''We hope to decide on a direction, but that is not to say we'll immediately execute,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/25/business/company-news-top-shareholder-of-scherer-sues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Top Shareholder Of Scherer Sues", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Top Shareholder Of Scherer Sues", "body_text": " **********The largest shareholder in the R.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military ruler of Panama, in effect sold his government to drug traffickers for millions of dollars in bribes and turned Panama into a capital of international cocaine smuggling, the Justice Department charged in two indictments made public today. **********In one of the indictments, Federal prosecutors suggested a connection between Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and drug operations run by General Noriega and the so-called Medellin cartel, a Colombian cocaine ring that is said to be responsible for more than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. **********While prosecutors said the Justice Department lacked enough information to bring formal charges against Mr. Castro, they described the evidence against General Noriega, who has ruled Panama since 1983, as overwhelming. $4.6 Million in Payoffs Alleged ''In plain language, he utilized his position to sell the country of Panama to drug traffickers,'' said Leon B. Kellner, the United States Attorney in Miami, whose grand jury brought one of the two long-awaited indictments. **********The indictments here and in Tampa charge that General Noriega took more than $4.6 million in payoffs to provide secure airstrips and haven for some of the world's most violent drug traffickers, including a group of fugitives linked to the assassination of Colombia's Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, in 1984. **********The indictments, which were returned on Thursday and unsealed today, raise serious questions about the Reagan Administration's once vigorous support for General Noriega and his Government. Panama Denounces Charges **********The 49-year-old general has repeatedly denied involvement in drug trafficking and has accused the United States of making false allegations against his Government in an effort to retain control of the Panama Canal. **********In Panama, the Foreign Ministry said today that ''Panama energetically and indignantly rejects this new assault against its leaders and institutions and warns that neither these actions nor any other will make us cede.'' **********The ministry also said it would be ''extremely dangerous'' for the United States to try ''the patience, tolerance and good faith'' of Panama ''with campaigns which could lead to unforeseen reactions.'' **********The indictments also complicate efforts by the Administration to ease General Noriega from power, and some United States officials expressed fear that he might retaliate against American interests and the 50,000 Americans living in Panama. 'No Hindrance' **********Mr. Kellner said he recognized the effect of the 12-count indictment on already strained relations between the United States and Panama. **********''I recognized the implications of indicting a person who controls a country, and General Noriega controls Panama,'' Mr. Kellner said. But he said he had received ''no hindrance'' from any official in the Reagan Administration in pursuing the 14-month investigation. **********Because of limited extradition treaties between the United States and Panama, it is almost inconceivable that the general will be brought to the United States for trial while he holds power. Rangel Charges Cover-Up **********The chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, today accused the Administration of a ''full-blown cover-up of the facts about Noriega,'' who maintained a close relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency and William J. Casey, its director from 1981 to 1987. **********Reagan Administration officials said the criminal investigation of General Noriega began with what one described as a ''relatively small-scale drug investigation'' by Mr. Kellner's office that mushroomed as additional witnesses provided evidence against the general. **********A senior Federal law enforcement official said Justice Department representatives asked for a meeting last fall with their counterparts at the State Department to determine ''whether State would try to block this.'' **********''There wasn't a problem,'' the official said. ''State and Justice agreed that if there was evidence to indict Noriega, indict him.'' 'Money Laundering Centers' **********At a news conference, Mr. Kellner said General Noriega provided invaluable assistance to drug dealers by his willingness to transform Panamanian banks into little more than ''money laundering centers.'' **********''Panama was extremely important to the success of the Medellin cartel because this is where their money went,'' he said. ''This gave traffickers a safe haven to put money where we couldn't find it.'' **********The indictment brought in Miami by Mr. Kellner names 16 defendants in a cocaine conspiracy dating from at least 1981, including Capt. Luis Del Cid of the Panama National Guard, who was described as General Noriega's liaison with drug traffickers, and Amet Paredes, son of the Panama's former military commander of Panama, Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes. Another of General Paredes' sons, Ruben Jr., was killed in Colombia in 1986 as he made arrangements to acquire a load of cocaine, the indictment said. The general has accused General Noriega of ordering the murder. **********Also indicted were Gustavo Dejesus Gaviria-Rivero and Pablo Escobar-Gaviria, identified as leaders of the Medellin cartel. **********Prosecutors said that two of the defendants - they would not say which ones - were believed to be in the United States, and that warrants had been issued for their arrest. **********A three-count Federal indictment brought in Tampa charged General Noriega with conspiring to smuggle more than a million pounds of marijuana into the United States. **********Under the scheme, the indictment said, General Noriega also agreed to permit more than $100 million in proceeds from the marijuana sales to be laundered through Panamanian banks. **********A key prosecution witness in the Tampa case is Stephen M. Kalish, a convicted American drug dealer who testified at a Senate hearing last week that he gave millions of dollars in kickbacks to General Noriega. Movement of Drugs Described **********The broader Miami indictment described the movement through Panama of thousands of pounds of Colombian cocaine bound for the United States. In one shipment, more than a ton of cocaine was placed aboard a Panamanian cargo plane in June 1984 and flown to Miami. **********According to the indictment, General Noriega performed a variety of services for the Colombian smugglers: He provided them with secure airstrips, ordered Panamanian customs and immigration officials to ignore their drug shipments, and allowed fugitives to remain in Panama if they were sought by law enforcement officials elsewhere in the world. **********The 30-page indictment says Mr. Castro was instrumental in 1984 in mediating a dispute between General Noriega and members of the Medellin cartel over the Panamanian government's seizure of a cocaine laboratory run by the cartel. According to the Justice Department, the disagreement was resolved during a Havana meeting between General Noriega and Mr. Castro. Rare Indictment of a Leader **********The Justice Department said this was only the second time it had indicted the sitting leader of a foreign nation; the other was Norman Saunders, the former chief minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a tiny chain of islands in the Caribbean, who was convicted in 1985 on American drug charges. **********If convicted on all counts in the Miami indictment, General Noriega could face life in prison and a maximum fine of $1.4 million.

Powell, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, needed help in raising Japanese money for the museum's new $12.5 million Pavilion for Japanese Art, the path led to Mr. Nagamura. Chairman of the California First Bank subsidiary of the Bank of Tokyo, Mr. Nagamura is considered the leading bridge between the American and Japanese business and cultural establishments in southern California. **********''If we could not support this project, it would have been the shame of the Japanese community,'' Mr. Nagamura, 62 years old, said in his serene downtown office, seated beside a ficas tree and speaking hesitant but correct English. His success in raising $4 million for the museum in less than a year shows how formidable Mr. Nagamura's fund-raising skills have become. Indeed, the effort took six trips to Japan and conversations with more than 200 Japanese companies. But more important, it illustrates the changing attitude on the part of Japanese business toward the American market. **********The Japanese have rarely been philanthropic in the American sense, said James Hodgson, the American ambassador to Japan from 1974 to 1977, who knows Mr. Nagamura. **********''Occasionally a founder may establish something in his own name, like a Bridgestone Museum,'' Mr. Hodgson said. ''But these are monuments to themselves rather than contributions to the civic betterment. The idea of working gratis for civic improvement is something almost wholly unrecognized in Japan.'' **********Nor are there tax laws to encourage it. And what made matters even more difficult for Mr. Nagamura was the trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. **********''I told them that the relations between the United States and Japan are so important,'' Mr. Nagamura said of his pitch to Japanese executives. ''We have to communicate with the American people, not only politically and economically but also culturally. Japan has great art - to show such great art will help promote better feeling.'' **********Scheduled to open in September, the pavilion will house a highly acclaimed collection of Edo-period art, compiled by Joe D. Price, the Oklahoma collector, and other Japanese art. **********For his part, Mr. Nagamura represents a small but growing breed of Japanese executives exquisitely schooled not only in the inward-looking ways of Japanese corporations but also in the outgoing ways of American business, where public relations, ''contacts,'' philanthropy and political contributions are often essential tools of business. **********Increasing numbers of Japanese companies are contributing to hospitals and museums; they are also sponsoring sports and academic events in communities in which they operate. Hitachi Ltd. and the Honda Motor Company, among others, have established philanthropic foundations. Mr. Nagamura's California First Bank has donated not only to art, but also to the political warchests of political leaders like Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles and Gov. George Deukmejian of California. **********The local reaction to all this has been mixed, sometimes slightly suspicious. But Mr. Nagamura defends this aggressive new posture: ''American corporations do it, we do it. We are corporate citizens.'' **********Over the years, Mr. Nagamura's role has broadened beyond day-to-day banking matters to duties as local statesman and ambassador to the Los Angeles community at large. He is president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of Southern California, a director of the Japanese Cultural Community Center of Los Angeles and, as reward for his tireless fund-raising efforts, he has been named a trustee of the Los Angeles art museum. The museum has long been a focal point for the city's social and business elite. **********Indeed, his successful fund-raising efforts on behalf of the museum have already attracted the attention of others scouting for donations. He has just been asked to raise $2 million for the 1990 Los Angeles arts festival, which will highlight Asian and Latin American arts. **********''He deals effectively with Occidentals and at the same time he is able to induce Japanese companies to realize it is in their own best interests to be charitable in the United States,'' Richard E. Sherwood, a Los Angeles lawyer and museum trustee, said. **********Daniel N. Belin, a lawyer and president of the museum's board of trustees, called Mr. Nagamura ''a remarkable man.'' He noted that Mr. Nagamura had raised the money in Japan while Congress was imposing sanctions on Japanese electronics companies. ''He once told me he thought this was the greatest achievement of his career,'' Mr. Belin said. **********It has been a long career, but until he became active in Los Angeles civic affairs, it was one marked by the conformity and single-purpose typical of Japanese business careers. An economics graduate of the University of Tokyo, Mr. Nagamura started with the Bank of Tokyo in 1947 and never left. In all, he has spent 16 years in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The bank has its headquarters in San Francisco, but Mr. Nagamura keeps his office here because Los Angeles has eclipsed San Francisco as the West Coast's financial capital. **********ARMED with a pocket Japanese-English dictionary, he presides over the second-largest Japanese-owned bank in the United States and the sixth-largest commercial bank in California, with $6.1 billion in assets, 135 offices and 3,900 employees. Seventy-seven percent of the stock in the mainly retail bank, which is traded over-the-counter, is held by the Bank of Tokyo. **********So far, the major Japanese banks in the United States, possibly because of conservative lending practices, have not performed as well as American ones. But California First, with a return on assets in 1987 of 68-hundredths of 1 percent, has done better than most. It recently announced plans to expand by buying the Union Bancorp here for $750 million. Mr. Nagamura was not entirely eager when first drawn into the museum effort a couple of years ago by Taizo Watanabe, then the Japanese Consul General here. The timing was bad, too, inasmuch as Japanese export-driven economy was struggling to overcome the rise in the value of the yen. But the museum leaders pressed him. ''We wanted to do it properly - we did not want to offend,'' said Mr. Powell, the museum director. ''We did not want to just write to the C.E.O.'s. You always need a personal emissary to break the ice, rather than just going cold.'' **********MR. NAGAMURA knew what to do, and it was painfully complex. He knew that it would be futile to try to raise the money from the local California offices of the major Japanese companies, because they lacked autonomy from Tokyo. ''So I thought I better go to Japan directly,'' he said. **********There he sought and obtained the endorsement of the Federation of Economic Organizations, the so-called Keidanren, an influential body that opened the doors to hundreds of companies. His message played on Japanese pride and face. ''This is a great art collection,'' he told potential contributors. ''An American museum started it and American business leaders backed it.'' Wouldn't it be embarrassing, he said, if the Japanese did not contribute. **********The target was 500 million yen, or $3 million at the time. But with the fall of the dollar, that became about $3.7 million, which together with nearly $300,000 raised from the local Japanese business community, put the Japanese contribution at $4 million.

Smaller amounts came from other Japanese companies including Hitachi, the Toshiba Corporation, the Panasonic Company, the Nissan Motor Company and Honda. His own bank gave $25,000. **********By the end, Mr. Nagamura was sounding like a Chamber of Commerce booster for Los Angeles. ''The business community here is very anxious to make this city more a cultural center,'' he said. ''Economically and industrially it is tops. But that is not enough. We must have more culture. I am so impressed by the spirit.'' **********But back-slapping is not his style. Friends say Mr. Nagamura is warm, easy-going and candid. But his style is understated, indirect. ''His way is to teach by example,'' Mr. Hodgson said. ''He is not assertive in the American sense. He would never deign to tell anyone how to do something. He's not one to throw his weight around.'' **********For all his attachments to California, Mr. Nagamura remains quite Japanese. When he retires, he and his wife will return to Japan, where his daughter, Makiko, 28 years old and a graduate of the University of California at Davis, recently delivered his first grandchild. His San Francisco-born son, Masaaki, works for an insurance company in Japan. **********''The triumph of Nagamura,'' Mr. Hodgson said, ''is that he has been able to retain Japanese traditions and succeed in responding to the civic climate of southern California.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/business/what-s-new-in-the-tennis-business-winning-more-points-on-cable-television.html": {"writer_name": "Damon Wright", "pub_date": "1988-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Winning More Points On Cable Television", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN THE TENNIS BUSINESS; Winning More Points On Cable Television", "body_text": " **********WHILE tennis has been declining in popularity on broadcast television, it is becoming a star attraction on cable. The amount of tennis programming on cable television has grown steadily over the past four years, mainly on USA Network and ESPN. **********Three years ago, USA broadcast 39 hours of the U.S. Open. This year, it has scheduled 61 hours as part of a total of 80 hours for all tennis events. ESPN increased its coverage of all tennis events from 147 hours in 1985 to more that 200 hours this year. And along with the hours, the quality of tennis programming has increased. **********At first, in a rush to fill air time, cable stations were less selective about the tennis events they broadcast. Now, cable stations are vying for the major events and, while they are broadcasting fewer events, they are devoting more time to each. **********For the Open, USA struck a deal with CBS to televise the earlier matches of the tournament. CBS will still broadcast the later, and more important games - reflecting the reality that even though the cable audience has grown dramatically, the networks still reach twice as many households. USA recently reached an agreement with CBS and the United States Tennis Association to present the Open for 1989 and 1990. **********A week before the tournament, 95 percent of the advertising for this year's Open had been sold, said John Silvestri, senior vice president of advertising sales at USA. He expected to be sold out by this weekend. **********Revenues are increasing. Last year USA scheduled 50 hours of Open programming and earned a 1.3 rating, up from 0.8 the year before. (One cable rating point equals 327,000 households.) This enabled USA to increase its advertising prices for 1988 by 15 to 20 percent. **********The average cost for a 30-second commercial last year on USA was $5,000, according to the network. The cost of a 30-second ad during CBS's Open coverage was about $29,000, according to Nielsen Media Research. **********Price is not cable's only selling point. Tennis ratings have been generally eroding on NBC and CBS - CBS experienced a 1.2 million drop in Open viewers in the last four years. **********Cable's strongest attraction, however, is its demographics. Cable viewers generally have higher income than network viewers, and cable tennis viewers earn more than the cable audience in general."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/business/company-news-textron-plans-sale-of-gorham-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Textron Plans Sale Of Gorham Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Textron Plans Sale Of Gorham Unit", "body_text": " **********Textron Inc., a diversified manufacturer of aerospace and commercial products, said it planned to sell its Gorham division, which makes sterling silverware, fine china and crystal.

System", "print_headline": "A Slow Beginning For an I.B.M. System", "body_text": " **********Software is now being sold that is designed to run with OS/2, the operating system introduced last fall by the International Business Machines Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation, a major software publisher. But analysts say the new products fall short of tapping OS/2's vast potential. **********OS/2 has been publicized as a means of lifting desktop computing to new levels of speed and versatility. An operating system is the core software that manages the way a computer handles data and makes it possible for other software programs to perform such tasks, or applications, as word processing or data base management. **********I.B.M. and Microsoft have both long said that OS/2 would allow computer networking, better data storage and retrieval capabilities, the ability to run several programs at once and a way to communicate with the computer that is based on a visual approach rather than on commands written in text. Stopping Short **********But the software now being sold, the analysts say, does not go far enough in taking advantage of OS/2. **********''The only thing that will make OS/ 2 work is new applications; we don't have that driving force yet,'' said Seymour Merrin, a computer industry analyst who is president of Merrin Resources in Southport, Conn. ''And if it's merely a better version, it's not enough. It has to be something fundamentally new.'' **********Until such programs appear, OS/2 is likely to languish, an expensive tool of interest only to the most sophisticated personal computer users. **********High stakes are involved. The success or failure of OS/2 will determine whether I.B.M., the nation's largest computer maker, maintains its dominance of the personal computer industry and Microsoft continues as a software power. If OS/2 can become the industry standard, I.B.M.'s year-old line of personal computers, the PS/2, will probably take hold, just as its PC line of desktop computers did after their introduction in 1981. **********A misstep by Microsoft and I.B.M. would leave an opening for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Unix, a popular software system that has been used on minicomputers in the past and is now being rewritten by A.T.&T. and Sun Microsystems Inc. for use on desktop personal computers. **********Unix has features similar to those of OS/2 and has the added potential advantage of being available on a wide variety of computers. In contrast, OS/2 will be available only on computers based on microprocessors manufactured by the Intel Corporation. Intel's microprocessors have been at the heart of I.B.M.'s personal computers and are a mainstay of the PS/2 machines. A Break for Apple **********Moreover, a lag in OS/2's acceptance gives Apple Computer more time to entrench its sophisticated Macintosh II computer in the corporate world. The Macintosh has been gaining acceptance, particularly because of the way it displays data and permits the user to control the computer by pointing at symbols rather than issuing commands by text. The Macintosh's look and feel are decidedly different from the text-based look and feel of I.B.M.'s personal computers using Microsoft's software. **********OS/2 is meant to replace the venerable and relatively simplistic MS-DOS operating system, now familiar to legions of users of the I.B.M. PC and compatible computers. Breakthrough Awaited **********But the problems that have affected OS/2's acceptance in the personal computer field were evident this week at the Comdex computer trade show in Atlanta. Officials of both I.B.M. and Microsoft acknowledged that they were still waiting for the breakthrough software program that would fully exploit the new features of OS/2. **********Such a program might come from either of the companies but is more likely to come from an outside software concern, just as popular financial spreadsheet programs, like the Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3 or Microsoft's word processing program Word, drove sales of the I.B.M. PC in recent years. **********Analysts agreed that such a breakthrough program was not in evidence at Comdex. Price a Factor, Too **********In addition, personal computer users must surmount intimidating price barriers to upgrade their machines to run OS/2. A recent report by Andrew Seybold in his publication Outlook on Professional Computing indicated that a computer user must be prepared to spend as much as $2,500 to switch to OS/2. **********Such price tags are ''a stopper for an individual buyer,'' said Ira M. Lubert, chairman of Compucom, a national chain of computer stores. ''Today, the OS/2 buyer is in the corporate world.'' Analysts said OS/2's ultimate success would depend on acceptance by the individual personal computer user. **********OS/2's fortunes are further complicated by the shortage of memory chips and their rising prices. For the system to function properly, a computer must have at least 3 million bytes of random access memory. Apple Suing Microsoft **********Apple Computer recently added a complication when it filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, charging that Microsoft had violated a major software licensing agreement between the two companies. The suit questions whether some parts of Microsoft's programs look and feel too much like Macintosh's display. **********Despite such difficulties, officials of both I.B.M. and Microsoft said they were pleased with OS/2's progress. **********''We're almost exactly where we want to be,'' said William Gates, chairman of Microsoft. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., said it had sold more than 3,000 development kits to software publishers who are working on new applications designed to run with OS/2. The hope is that new programs for I.B.M. computers using OS/2 will generate a critical mass that will persuade computer users to embrace the PS/2 computers and the OS/2 system. **********At Comdex, William Lowe, president of I.B.M.'s entry systems division, said 52 software companies planned to market programs designed for OS/2 by June. He said he expected more than 300 programs on the market by year-end. **********Despite these optimistic signs, of the companies selling OS/2 applications only Borland International is among the top 10 American software publishers. Vendors Cautious **********Industry analysts see this as a telling indication of caution by major software vendors. They are waiting until they have a firm sign that OS/2 will be the operating standard of the future before they commit their resources. **********Companies are also moving slowly because uncertainty surrounds the operating system project itself. Decisions must still be made on whether to press ahead with development of OS/2 applications programs based on the Intel 80286 microprocessor or wait for a new version of OS/2 that takes advantage of special features of the more powerful 80386 microprocessor. **********Companies must also decide whether to race to develop software under the old text-only method of issuing commands to the computer or wait for the OS/2's Presentation Manager method, which will be graphic in nature and directly challenge Macintosh's graphic approach. Presentation Manager will not be available before the fall. **********''All this stuff is confusing,'' acknowledged Mr. Gates of Microsoft. Fighting Apple's lead **********Presentation Manager is crucial to competing with the Macintosh, analysts said. Mr. Gates said Apple had a one- to two-year lead in the marketplace, in terms of graphics-oriented applications. But he said that OS/2 was a more sophisticated operating system than Macintosh's and that I.B.M. would close the gap based on OS/2's advanced features. **********Both Microsoft and I.B.M. are investing significant sums in designing their new operating system. Although neither company would comment on their costs in the two-and-a-half-year effort, Microsoft said it had put 250 programmers and technical writers, more than 10 percent of its work force, on the OS/2 effort. **********Despite the problems, I.B.M. and Microsoft have their advocates who believe that large corporations will be eager to take advantage of the new features of OS/2 and to link desktop computers into a cohesive network. **********''I'm an optimist; our data say that the largest corporations are ready to do it,'' said Kathy Lane, a software analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. ''It's like buying a new car. At a certain time you decide that your used clunker is ready to be traded in.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/business/rates-little-changed-by-economic-data.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rates Little Changed by Economic Data", "print_headline": "Rates Little Changed by Economic Data", "body_text": " **********Interest rates were little changed yesterday as a welter of fresh statistics on inflation, retail sales and industrial production did not clarify the outlook for the economy. **********Trading was active early in the day, but prices of long-term Treasury bonds were not able to sustain their early gains.

But by late in the day, the bellwether issue was offered at 102 3/8, up 7/32, to yield nearly 8.90 percent. **********''In the morning, the market was lifted by the economic data,'' said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. ''Later in the day, as oil prices rose and the dollar fell, the bond market weakened.'' The Morning Reports **********The morning rise in bond prices followed announcements of no change in industrial production for September - a sharp weakening from the average gains of more than half a percent over the previous three months -and a decline of four-tenths of a percent in retail sales for the month. **********Some analysts warned, however, that the retail sales figure was not as weak as it appeared. They pointed to strong gains in general merchandise and apparel sales for September and upward revisions in non-auto sales to a gain of half a percent in August, from two-tenths of a percent reported earlier, and of four-tenths of a percent in July, from one-tenth of a percent. **********Economists at MMS International, an economic advisory firm based in Belmont, Calif., said that because of gains in general merchandise and upward revisions to non-auto sales, ''it appears that consumer spending continues to be a source of growth in demand, with no clear signs of slowing from the earlier months of the year.'' **********Although the MMS analysts predicted that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy and raise short-term interest rates a notch by early November, that view is not widely held. In fact, a MMS survey of analysts showed that the median forecast for the overnight rate of bank loans in the Federal funds market in mid-November was 8 1/8 percent, unchanged from the average of recent weeks. Economists' Expectations **********While economists expect the Fed to continue to pay close attention to inflationary pressures, they said the producer price report may have been overlooked by traders yesterday because its announcement coincided with the reports on retail sales and industrial production. Excluding energy - a component of producer prices where the outlook depends on developments among oil exporting countries, not economic conditions -producer prices rose eight-tenths of a percent. **********The overall index rose four-tenths of a percent, or 1.5 percent over the last three months. In the previous three months the gain in producer prices was 1.2 percent, up from seven-tenths of a percent in the previous three months and in contrast to a decline of half a percent in the three months before that. **********As Treasury note and bond prices retreated from their morning highs, securities dealers said that speculative traders were paying close attention to developments in the oil and currency markets.

He indicated that the commission would be meeting steadily, with open hearings, from Nov. 9 until the end of the year. 'I Believe We'll Sell It' **********''I think we're going to make it,'' Mr. Strauss told a private economic conference meeting here. And, he added, ''I believe we'll sell it.'' **********But Mr. Strauss, who said the proposed cuts were devised with a computer model, did not try to minimize the difficulties that still lie ahead in completing the budget plan or of gaining acceptance for it in Congress and at the White House. ''It is the toughest job I have ever undertaken,'' he said. **********On the revenue side, he said, ''we have a serious problem.'' One aspect of that problem is that Vice President Bush has apparently ruled out tax increases if he is elected President. No Specific Dukakis Plan **********Nor is it clear how much of the Strauss outline Michael S. Dukakis would accept if elected President. Asked for his reaction to the Strauss statement, Lawrence Summers of Harvard University, the chief economic adviser to the Massachusetts Governor, said he thought Mr. Strauss, who is a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was ''politically very astute,'' but that Mr. Dukakis would have no specific budget plan for the ''opposition to shoot at'' until after the election. **********The Republican co-chairman of the commission, Drew Lewis, chairman of the Union Pacific Corporation and a former Secretary of Transportation in the Reagan Administration, could not be reached for comment. However, Mr. Lewis is reportedly in close agreement with Mr. Strauss on the general approach for getting rid of the budget deficit by a combination of cost cuts for the military and Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements, together with tax increases. **********''They've really got to sell it on the Hill,'' said Harry Freeman, executive vice president of government relations for the American Express Company, where Mr. Lewis is a board member. ''But they are capable of selling it to the big-business community. I don't know of two better people for getting bipartisan support for a pragmatic solution to the budget problem.'' **********The commission, with six Republican and six Democratic members appointed by Congress, was the outgrowth of proposals originally made by Governor Cuomo of New York. After the November election, the new President will name two additional members to the commission; the law requires that one be a Republican and the other a Democrat. Unconcern by Public Seen **********A major problem facing the commission, Mr. Strauss indicated, was that the general public was not really concerned about the budget deficit. **********An immediate difficulty in including the military in the cuts is that Caspar W. Weinberger, the former Secretary of Defense and an ardent champion of the military's expansion, is a commission member. **********There are likely to be other dissidents on the commission when particular cuts are involved. Mr. Strauss did not go beyond saying that he believed there was a ''70-30'' chance that the panel's final budget-cutting recommendations would prove acceptable. Details on Taxes Avoided **********Mr. Strauss avoided getting into details on the thinking of the commission on how to increase tax revenues. He indicated that the cuts in expenditures would have to come first, and that the group would then turn its attention to the budget's revenue side. **********He indicated that there were two areas that seemed to be drawing favor: ''sin taxes,'' that is, taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages, and some form of tax on consumption, such as a value added tax or a general national sales tax. Such taxes, he said, were more likely than ''the raising of tax rates.'' **********He added that the panel was not considering sales of Federal assets or privatization of Federal operations in order to close the deficit gap."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/01/business/august-home-sales-up-0.1-three-month-pace-strong.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "August Home Sales Up 0.1%; Three-Month Pace Strong", "print_headline": "August Home Sales Up 0.1%; Three-Month Pace Strong", "body_text": " **********Sales of new single-family homes, bolstered by a surge in the Middle West, rose slightly in August to continue the strongest sales pace since early 1987. **********The Commerce Department said today that sales inched up by one-tenth of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 units in August, 1,000 more sales than in July and the same as in June. **********It was the strongest three-month pace since February-April 1987, when sales were booming because fixed-rate mortgages had fallen to a low for the decade of 8.5 to 9 percent. **********The strength this summer has surprised many analysts, who were concerned about the effect on sales of the Federal Reserve Board's moves to push up interest rates to restrain inflation.

Because of a ruling by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, these subsidiaries' results, which have been reported separately, are going to be consolidated into the corporate parent's profit-or-loss statement and its balance sheet. The new method begins with statements for 1988. **********The bottom line - earnings per share - will not be affected by the change, known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94. But including the debts and assets of the subsidaries will inflate the balance sheets of the parent companies. And some confusion may result as different companies take different approaches to complying with the new rule. **********Although the companies affected by the change will restate results of previous years so investors can compare new and old reports on an equivalent basis, some of the numbers may seem startling. **********Ford, for example, reported its total assets as $44.9 billion at the end of 1987; restated to include operations of finance subsidaries, the figure becomes $118 billion. Since net income remains unchanged at $4.6 billion, the apparent return on assets would be 3.9 percent instead of 10.2 percent. But analysts said any confusion caused by the new statements should be short-lived and should have little effect on the companies' stock prices. ''There are lots of people who have calculated the total debt of the car companies as if they were consolidated, so those numbers are known,'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney. ''The important thing is that they will continue to report on both parts of the business, so there will be no loss of information.'' **********David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert said: ''I don't think there will be any effect on stock prices. The companies are telegraphing the way they will present the figures, so there should not be any surprises.'' **********Nonetheless, the three domestic auto companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, may each take a different approach to displaying their results, which would make comparisons between companies more difficult. **********A spokesman for Chrysler said it would report the new way and then add more pages to its year-end statement to show the previous data. **********Ford, rejecting the two-sets-of-books approach, has been circulating sample consolidated statements (based on 1987 operations) that divide all results into two categories - ''automotive and other'' and ''financial services'' - to preserve the distinction between its manufacturing and purely financial operations. **********A G.M. official said the automotive giant had not yet decided how to deal with the ruling. **********The three companies objected to the new rule, complaining that it would combine their highly leveraged financing operations with their more conservatively structured manufacturing operations. At Ford, for instance, if last year's statement had been consolidated, nearly $55 billion in apparently new debt would have shown up on the balance sheet. Since the debt already existed (though reported elsewhere), however, ratings on the company's debt securities are not expected to change. **********''Investors want to see the disaggregated numbers because that is how we finance our company,'' said Robert S. Miller Jr., Chrysler's vice chairman. **********''The borrowings of the parent are based on the industrial assets of the company,'' he said, ''and the borrowings of the finance subsidiary are based on its financial assets. To lump them together is like adding apples and oranges.'' **********Mr. Miller said the effect of the change would be ''some confusion on the part of investors and some added weight of paper.'' **********Halsey Bullen, an official of the accounting standards board, explained its reasoning. He said the new rule would close a loophole that had enabled some companies to look less leveraged than they really were. **********''There was a comparability problem between companies that consolidated large amounts of debt and those that did not,'' he said. The seven-member board decided that providing financing for dealers and car buyers was an integral part of the automobile business and should be shown in financial statements. **********Some companies like General Electric have credit subsidiaries that are far less involved with product sales. But even there, Mr. Bullen said, the board's conclusion is that the same management presides over the entire enterprise and that earnings are a result of overall operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/19/business/profits-scoreboard-210988.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROFITS SCOREBOARD", "print_headline": "PROFITS SCOREBOARD", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/29/world/south-africans-strike-botswana.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 398, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Africans Strike Botswana", "print_headline": "South Africans Strike Botswana", "body_text": " **********South African troops killed four people early today in a raid on a house in Gaborone, the capital of neighboring Botswana, the Government said. **********In a statement issued tonight, Gen.

It also said that the Government should stop describing street protests that led to the killings as a rebellion, and should characterize them instead as part of a pro-democratic movement. **********The committee's recommendation was the first significant measure taken by an official body to heal the wounds left by the Kwangju episode, in which troops gunned downed unarmed civilians protesting a coup led by Gen. Chun Doo Hwan, who is now President. By official count, nearly 200 people died, but Kwangju residents insist that a cover-up has hidden the true death toll, which many of them put at 2,000. **********The massacre was a pivotal event for South Korea. Because of Kwangju, many Koreans - arguably, most -have never accepted the political legitimacy of Mr. Chun, whose term of office expires Wednesday at midnight. He will give way then to Roh Tae Woo, a fellow former general who helped him grab power and who will take office Thursday as South Korea's first freely elected president in 17 years. 'Abide by Its Spirit' **********Mr. Roh, accepting the committee's report, pledged to ''abide by its spirit,'' but he did not say specifically what action he would take, or when. **********As Mr. Roh's inauguration approached, the two main opposition leaders, Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung, met today for the first time since before the presidential election Dec. 16. It was the first sign that the Kims might be able to reunite after a ruinous falling-out last fall, when they both insisted on running for president and thereby split the anti-Government camp, allowing Mr. Roh to win with only 36.6 percent of the vote. **********Opposition politicians have expressed concern that unless the Kims can patch up their differences they will face another disaster in National Assembly elections expected to be held in April. It is unclear, though, whether the two men can overcome serious personal and philosophical divisions. **********In an attempt to encourage unity, Kim Young Sam gave up his party's presidency two weeks ago, although he clearly remains its dominant force. Today, he agreed to the other Kim's formula for a pre-election reapportionment of the National Assembly. But thus far Kim Dae Jung has resisted pressure that he similarly step aside, saying he will do so only after the rival opposition parties are merged. Chun Expresses Regrets **********On Kwangju, President Chun has suddenly abandoned years of total silence over the last few weeks, and has used farewell news conferences to express regret that he is stepping down with the matter unresolved. But he has never come close to apologizing for the killings, or to suggesting that his troops may have overreacted, as even the martial-law commander at the time acknowledged recently. **********Mr. Chun's departure after eight years of authoritarian rule is a historic moment for South Korea. Never before has a South Korean leader voluntarily stepped aside, and he presents his action as being, of itself, a critical step in the country's democratic development. **********His successor, Mr. Roh, appointed the 56-member reconciliation committee after his election, and instructed it to suggest ways not only to deal with Kwangju but also to promote democratic change in general. **********Speaking in broad outline, the panel urged the new President, among other measures, to restrict domestic surveillance by intelligence agencies and to guarantee press freedom and an independent judiciary. But its most striking conclusions involved Kwangju. **********Although it called for an official apology, the committee rejected long-standing opposition demands for a new investigation into the incident, calling it fruitless and potentially divisive. Nevertheless, its own inquiry involved days of public hearings, highlighted by often-emotional testimony from people who had been swept up in the 1980 events.

The portion never fell below 41 percent in the 1970's. **********''The program is clearly shrinking,'' said Vivek Moorthy, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco who has studied the phenomenon. ''People are no longer thinking of unemployment insurance as a buffer to help them while they try to find new work.'' Effect on a Recession **********The decline could prolong the next recession, some economists say. The extra billions in jobless benefits are one way in which the Government can slow the decline in consumption and therefore hasten a recovery. **********The system is failing in the 1980's for two major reasons, economists and government officials say. One is a tightening of eligibility requirements. Faced with inadequate amounts of money in the trust funds that finance the benefits, state governments, which administer the system, have decided on this course rather than raising taxes sufficiently to replenish the funds. **********The other factor has to do with the changing nature of the work force, which is now dominated by service industry workers. Many are part-timers, temporary employees and freelancers who sometimes do not work enough hours or earn enough to qualify for unemployment pay under the more stringent rules. **********In addition, service industry employees are less likely than in-dustrial workers to apply for jobless benefits, whether or not they qualify. ''Many of the unemployed aren't even coming in the door anymore,'' said Walter S. Corson, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research, a private firm that has studied the system's shortcomings for the Labor Department. **********Economists say they do not know all the reasons for this reluctance, but they cite factors like less awareness of the right to benefits and lower membership in unions, which have historically seen to it that their unemployed members filed for benefits. Another obstacle has been the closing since 1980 of more than 700 of the 2,600 unemployment offices around the country, which means that the unemployed must often travel farther to file their applications. **********While economists are unsure about the relative impact of each factor, the Labor Department statistics show they add up to a trend. Slightly Lower This Year **********Of the 7.4 million people who were unemployed last year, only 2.3 million, or 31 percent, collected jobless pay, which averaged about $150 a week for a maximum of 26 weeks. The percentage of those receiving benefit checks has been slightly lower this year and has fallen steadily from 34 percent in 1984. **********Even in recessions, fewer people are receiving jobless pay. The number reached six million in the 1975 recession year, or 76 percent of the 7.9 million unemployed. But in the 1982 recession year, jobless pay went to only 4.8 million people, or 45 percent of the 10.7 million unemployed. **********A shortage of cash in state trust funds from which jobless benefits are paid is a big cause of this decline, according to a study by the General Accounting Office. **********By the end of 1987, the various state trust funds held a total of $23.2 billion. That was up sharply from $2.2 billion in 1984, the first year in the black after the last recession. But that amount is not up sufficiently given the continuing expansion of the economy. If a recession as severe as the one in 1981 and 1982 were to develop, the $23.2 billion would be used up in only eight months, the Labor Department estimates. The department considers a reserve adequate when it will last 18 months in a recession. **********In creating the unemployment insurance system in 1935, Congress delegated to the states the administration of the program and the right to tax business to raise money for it. **********The Social Security system was created in the same bill. From 1935 until 1950, the tax that business paid for both programs was a percentage of each worker's first $3,000 in pay. **********But after 1950, the paths of the two programs separated. Partly because the beneficiaries of Social Security had more political power than the unemployed, Congress has voted to push up the tax base for Social Security to a maximum of $45,000 of a salary. But Congress let the states base their unemployment insurance tax rate on only $7,000 in pay. The average amount that the states now tax is $8,400. New York and 15 other states tax the minimum; Alaska taxes the highest, $21,100. (Connecticut taxes $7,100 and New Jersey $12,000.) With this system, a cash shortage became inevitable. While tax revenue grew slowly, the labor force expanded rapidly and so did the number of unemployed, jumping from an average of 3.5 million people a year in the 1960's to an average of 8.7 million in the 1980's. Benefit payments have jumped from a 1970's high of $5 billion a year during the 1974-75 recession to an average of $15 billion a year since 1979. **********The cash shortage showed up first in the 1974-75 recession, when some states ran short of money to pay benefits and borrowed from Washington. The borrowing has reached $30 billion in the 1980's, most of it during the 1981-82 recession. Almost Entirely Paid Back **********These borrowings have been almost entirely paid back, but they could surge again to $15 billion if a recession as severe as the one in 1981-82 were to develop in the next year or two, government officials estimate. **********Until the 1980's the states did not hesitate to borrow from the Federal Government. The loans were interest free, so there was little incentive to cut back on benefit payments simply because the trust funds were low. **********Then the Reagan Administration imposed an interest charge on the loans to encourage repayment. **********In addition, the states found themselves competing intensely in the 1980's to persuade companies to put plants within their borders. A low tax for unemployment compensation became one lure. **********The upshot was that the average tax paid in the industrial states is only $663 annually per employee -far less than what businesses pay to finance Social Security. The amounts go as low as $434 in Indiana, which also has the lowest benefits: a maximum of $129 a week. **********''Suddenly the incentive was no longer to help the jobless but to keep down taxes and repay loans from the Federal Government as quickly as possible,'' said Louis Jacobson, senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. **********To cope, most states have not cut back on the level of weekly jobless pay, which has been rising gradually and continues to average one-third of a worker's most recent pay. But the Carter and Reagan Administrations have gradually imposed income taxes on jobless pay; it is now taxed as if it were normal income. $354 in Massachusetts Before it is taxed, the maximum benefit ranges from $354 a week in Massachusetts to the $129 in Indiana. (New York's is $180, New Jersey's is $241 and Connecticut's is $266.) But while states have not reduced benefit levels, they have cut their total payout in other ways. In recent years, every state except Alaska has limited benefits to a maximum of 26 weeks. In effect, the states have done away with the 13-week extension of benefits that kicked in when unemployment was high enough. **********In addition, people in nearly every state must earn a bit more and work a bit longer to qualify, an edging up that sometimes eliminates part-timers from unemployment pay. **********In Virginia, for instance, a person working 20 hours and earning $5 an hour would fail to qualify if laid off. In New York, that would happen to a person working half a week and earning under $4 an hour. In both states, these workers would have qualified more easily two or three years ago. **********Another major cutback involves those who resign from their jobs. Until the early 1980's many qualified for jobless pay if they remained out of work for 10 weeks or more; now jobless benefits are virtually never paid to those who resign voluntarily. **********Ineligibility is only part of the problem. Evidence is growing that the unemployment insurance system was better suited to an earlier time, before service industries displaced manufacturing and mining as the major source of employment. **********In the heyday for blue-collar labor that lasted until the 1970's, the typical factory worker remained at the same job for years. Unemployment came mostly in the form of the temporary layoff and workers came to consider unemployment pay a right to help them during layoffs. ''We have let that sense of entitlement erode,'' said Thomas Kane, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. **********Among white-collar workers today, job switching is commonplace. Moreover, millions of people are part-timers, temporary employees or freelancers working for a company on contract. ''They barely think of themselves as members of the work force, and the right to unemployment pay is a distant concept,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego. ''For them, going to the unemployment office can be quite intimidating and too much of a hassle.'' **********Other economists speculate that this is especially true in two-income families that can get by on one paycheck for a while. **********During layoffs in earlier days, unions were active in getting members to the unemployment office and helping them file claims. They still are, but their efforts have been limited by declining membership. **********David Card, a labor expert at Princeton University, found in a study that in states where unions are still strong - among them New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -nearly everyone eligible for jobless pay collects it. But in states where unions are weak, payments fall short of eligibility. Contrast With Europeans **********The shrinking unemployment insurance program puts the United States in ever-sharper contrast to the industrial nations of Europe. Government-paid benefits in many European countries run for a year or two and average 50 to 80 percent of an unemployed worker's last salary. **********The more generous European programs help to sustain economic growth in these industrial nations, even though European unemployment is about 10 percent - a level reached in the United States only during severe recessions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/18/business/credit-markets-treasury-bonds-and-notes-regain-ground.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1988-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 977, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Bonds and Notes Regain Ground", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Bonds and Notes Regain Ground", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose yesterday, recouping virtually all the losses sustained in the previous trading session. **********But the gains, which were spurred by a trade report that was slightly better than expected and a firmer dollar, were recorded on relatively thin volume, and market participants were left searching for direction. **********''The trade number was not really accompanied by big flows of business,'' one government bond trader said yesterday, ''and it has left the market groping for answers.

But analysts said that even if Republic's borrowings remained heavy for the next few months, the Fed would not be forced to tighten monetary policy. **********''I don't think this is anywhere like the Continental Illinois situation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Group. ''If the Fed does tighten later on, it will probably be for other reasons, like a resurgence in economic growth or a rise in inflation.'' **********In its report on the monetary aggregates, the Fed said that M-1, the nation's basic money supply, rose to a seasonally adjusted $755.6 billion from a revised $755 billion for the week ended March 7. M-1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank traveler's checks. In recent months the Fed has shifted its attention away from M-1 to the broader measures of money supply growth. **********The two broadest monetary measures, M-2 and M-3, also posted increases, the Fed said. M-2, which includes M-1 plus acounts like savings deposits and money market mutual funds, rose to a seasonally adjusted $2.954 trillion in the latest week, from $2.947 trillion a week earlier. **********The Fed's broadest measure, M-3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $3.725 trillion, from $3.721 trillion. M-3 consists of M-2 plus less-liquid accounts, like certificates of deposit in minimum demoninations of $100,000. **********Analysts said that yesterday's figures offered little cause for concern that the central bank would be forced to alter monetary policy anytime soon. **********In other developments, trading conditions remained quiet in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds, with little change in prices. Activity was also light in the new issue market, although one deal did raise some eyebrows. **********That issue, a two-part, $300 million offering from the Swedish Export Credit Corporation, contained a seldom seen 50-year debenture offering. The debentures, which mature on March 15, 2038, are noncallable for the first 10 years.

They are reluctant to buy stocks, but they are also reluctant to sell them. **********It is this lack of liquidity that is causing stock prices to be so volatile, traders say. Indeed, it now takes only about half as much money to drive prices up or down as it did a year ago, according to Salomon Brothers. **********For example, a study of trades of less than 10,000 shares found that it now requires only $1.5 million of net buying to move the Dow Jones industrial average up one point. One year ago, investors had to spend $2.5 million to push it up the same amount. And in such ''non-block'' trades, sales of $612,000 worth of a stock can drive down the Dow by a point, Salomon says. A year ago, investors had to sell shares worth $1.4 million to push the Dow down a point. **********This makes it much more difficult for traders to either accumulate or sell stock positions in their giant portfolios without disturbing the price in an undesired way. One trader, for example, has been trying to buy 200,000 shares of a stock that trades on the American Stock Exchange. He bought 60,000 shares at $39.25. Two days later, the stock was trading at $42.50 simply because of the buying pressure, he suspects. He has since backed away and is waiting to buy the remaining 140,000 shares at a lower price. ''You've got to work your tail off,'' he said. **********This experience is repeated almost every day, frustrated traders say. Yesterday, almost 30 minutes before the market closed, the Dow was up only about 8 points. But the bond market began to improve, and that had an impact on the spread between the stock index futures contracts and the stocks in the index. One Wall Street firm started a few buy programs for its stock index arbitrage group and within minutes the Dow was up 19 points. **********That kind of volatility makes some traders nervous and afraid to participate. They watch a stock jump on little volume, and then back off to let it cool down. That leaves the market to the aggressive fund managers, who engage in ''day trading'' to make quick profits. The actions of these short-term traders tend to exaggerate price moves, but they do not lend direction to an already listless market. **********''There isn't any leadership in buyers,'' said Kenneth Garvey, senior vice president and head trader at J.&W. Seligman, a New York firm that manages $7 billion. ''I think a lot of the volume is day trading.'' **********This volatility also creates opportunities for money managers who specialize in moving their clients' accounts in and out of stocks, bonds and various stock groups. ''The reward for being more anticipatory is greater than it's ever been,'' said Martin M. Hale, executive vice president of the Hellman, Jordan Management Company, a Boston firm that manages $1.1 billion for pension funds. **********The lack of liquidity is in direct contrast to the situation last year. At that time, investors continued to chase stocks higher and higher because they knew that other investors were still pouring billions of dollars into stocks. If they wanted to sell their stocks, they were certain that someone else - Japanese investors, European investors, mutual funds or pension fund managers - would buy them out at a higher price. **********But now the situation is reversed. Traders say that foreign investors seem absent from the stock market. Some specialist firms at the New York Stock Exchange are said to be using less capital to bring about trades, portfolio managers say. Block trading firms that handle the large institutional trades are committing less capital because they fear the market may sink again, leaving them with a portfolio under water. And professional money managers have higher-than-average cash positions in their portfolios because they are afraid to commit their money to stocks. **********Almost every week these managers focus on some variable, like the trade deficit or unemployment figures, to justify their inaction. Lately, they have focused mainly on the dollar. Until foreign investors are convinced that the United States will take action to support the dollar, they will not participate in these markets, they say.

Last week, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it would pay $1.35 billion to liquidate two California savings and loan associations that had gone bankrupt, producing the most expensive liquidations on record. It will devour more than 40 percent of the cash on hand at the Government's deposit insurance fund, whose paper losses already total almost $14 billion, according to the General Accounting Office. **********The bleeding does not stop there. **********Almost one-third of the nation's 3,120 savings and loan institutions lost money last year - a staggering total of $13.4 billion - and analysts expect losses to be just as big this year. More than 500 savings and loans are bankrupt and another 300 to 500 are nearly insolvent. In all, experts estimate that it will cost anywhere from $20 billion to $70 billion - and maybe more - to shut institutions that have already been found insolvent and to cover their losses. **********This is shaping up to be the biggest financial disaster of the post-war era. It is a crisis that could produce the largest Government bailout in history and the possibility that the thrift industry, born in the Depression to bolster home ownership, will not survive the turbulent, deregulated 1980's as an independent industry. **********As the scope of the disaster becomes increasingly clear, so does a picture of how the situation managed to get so out of control. **********Fingers point in different directions, and many take aim straight at the depressed Texas economy, whose plummeting oil prices brought down the real estate industry to which savings and loans had lent heavily. But there was not just one culprit, nor a single big mistake. Rather, from the late 1970's on, there was a confluence of error and ineptitude, at times compounded by fraud. Congress, regulators and the industry, all failed. Together, they produced a maelstrom of legislation, regulatory measures and lending practices that were too lenient, shortsighted, poorly conceived, politically compromised or inadequate. **********''There's an awful lot of blame to go around,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. **********''No one can really escape culpability here,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., a former economist at the Bank Board. ''Just about everything has gone wrong that could go wrong.'' **********Federal legislators, who frequently bowed to political pressure from an industry known for its powerful grass-roots lobbying, have come under fire for deregulating the thrift industry piecemeal and granting too much leeway in accounting practices. The Bank Board, the industry's primary regulator, is criticized for being too close to the thrift units it regulated, and for responding with inadequate resources and ill-trained examiners when the situation began to unravel. **********And the industry, for its part, was unable to cope with the high interest rates that sprang from the late 1970's and spurred deregulation. Many executives lacked expertise to compete in the new world of finance. More troubling were the aggressive entrepreneurs, wheeler-dealers and gamblers who saw an opportunity to make a bundle at the expense of the Federal Government. **********Now, in sorting through the rubble, several questions emerge. One is the scope of the problem; how many billions of dollars will be needed to resolve it depends partly on how much the government can salvage from real estate loans gone bad . Another is whether the policies pursued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board will be enough to halt the industry's deterioration. But what worries people most is this: In the last five and a half years, despite troubles in Texas, the United States economy has experienced a record economic boom. If the thrift industry bleeds profusely in good times, what will happen in the bad - when, say, interest rates spike up or the next recession hits? **********''Over the next two or three years, the industry is going to face either a high-interest-rate problem or another credit problem brought on by a recession, and it could face them both in sequence,'' said Henry J. Gailliot, chief economist for the Federated Research Corporation, a mutual fund investment company in Pittsburgh.  How Congress Failed **********Senator William Proxmire minces no words when he speaks of how Congress handled industry problems in the last 10 years. **********''Repeatedly, Congress moved too late or failed to produce legislation'' to halt the industry's demise, said the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. ''We created a whole new ball game in 1980,'' he said, referring to Congressional deregulation of interest rates. But, he added, the Federal Government was unwilling ''to appropriate funds to adequately police the new systems.'' **********Although some candid lawmakers blame themselves for insufficient action in the late 1970's and 80's, some analysts believe the roots of the crisis lie deep in the structure of the industry, established by Congress in 1932. The savings and loans - or building and loans, as others were called - were intended to take short-term deposits and use them to make 15-, 20- and 30-year mortgages. **********''The whole thrift financial structure was fundamentally flawed from the beginning,'' said Bert Ely, a banking and thrift consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''It is borrowing short to lend long. Sooner or later you are going to have a disaster.'' **********While interest rates held steady over the next few decades, the system worked. Congress had established an interest-rate ceiling for deposits and the business developed essentially risk-free. But when the Federal Reserve Board, to tame inflation, dramatically pushed up interest rates in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the system's fatal flaw was revealed: savings and loans were forced to pay more for deposits than their mortgage portfolios were yielding. **********The interest-rate ceiling that had long provided the industry with handsome profits began to suffocate it. Depositors, knowing that they could earn higher rates from money-market mutual funds, began massive withdrawals of their money. To finance that, the industry began selling assets at a loss. The result: Almost 500 institutions failed between 1980 and 1983, and the underlying net worth - the capital cushion used in times of stress to absorb losses - plummeted from $32.4 billion in 1980 to $20.3 billion by 1982. **********As losses mounted, Congress was urged to rescue the system it had created. But the steps it took had the unanticipated effect of making matters worse. **********''I don't think that most of us really understood just how serious the problem was,'' said Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah. ''When we began to realize how big it was, we did not have the resources to handle it.'' **********First, in 1980, Congress deregulated interest rates that depository institutions could pay on deposits. It also allowed the industry to offer adjustable-rate mortgages to help protect itself from interest-rate fluctuations. Then, in 1982, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Act, permitting the industry to enter new businesses, such as commercial loans like those from banks. The idea was to let the industry to diversify its asset portfolio and to shore up its finances. **********Deregulation was not confined to Washington. Several states - particularly Florida, Texas and California, trying to protect the interests of their state-chartered savings and loans - passed their own, even more sweeping, deregulatory provisions. Those measures essentially enabled institutions to engage in any lending practice they wanted. **********The new powers allowed institutions with skilled managers to benefit. But Congress and the state legislatures failed to take into account the existence of more than 1,000 severely weakened institutions. With diminishing resources, they began commiting funds to new, risky ventures: horse and fish farms, racetracks and building projects that made no economic sense. Many of these projects carried no proper documentation and had no valid appraisals. And state regulators proved particularly lax in supervising such transactions. **********''Texas and California had laws that said you could do anything you want with essentially no supervision,'' said Richard Pratt, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and now chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Assets Inc. ''And the results are obvious. I know of only two or three Federally chartered institutions that are in trouble; 95 precent are all state-charters.'' **********A disaster was in the works because the industry's deposits were insured by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. In 1980, when Congress deregulated interest rates, it increased deposit insurance for thrift institutions, banks and credit unions to $100,000 per account, from $40,000. But the mechanism, intended to protect depositors, enabled thrift executives to attract funds, even while they took big risks with large amounts of money. If they lost, the Government would pay the tab. **********Congress then made matters worse by inaction, Senator Proxmire said. It ignored pleas from some regulators to come down hard on thrift units in California and Texas, which were taking particularly large risks. **********In 1984, it failed to support the Bank Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in attempts to stop money brokers from placing large sums of insured deposits at risk-taking thrifts and banks. It initially opposed a Bank Board bid to limit savings and loans from placing more than 10 percent of their assets in risky real estates ventures. **********In general, Congress failed to support policies - other than those that provided regulatory leniency, or forbearance - for an industry taking greater and greater lending risks at the Government's expense. **********''The theory of forbearance is all right,'' Mr. Proxmire said. ''But it allowed poorly managed institutions to dig themselves into deeper difficulty at an ultimately higher cost to the Government.'' **********Congress's continued insistence on forbearance is developing into an ethical issue that Republicans are raising in the Presidential campaign. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Jim Wright, is under fire for trying to intervene with Bank Board enforcement actions against two insolvent Texas thrifts, whose owners were later charged with lending irregularities and fraud. In an almost unprecedented action, he called Edwin J. Gray, the Bank Board chairman, to get him to reconsider legal actions taken against the institutions. **********Other Congressional actions are under scrutiny, too. Last year, Congress was still pushing policies aimed at keeping sick thrifts open. Senator Garn noted that it took Congress almost two years to approve legislation to permit the F.S.L.I.C. to borrow up to $10.8 billion over the next three years to close down thrifts, at a time when losses were mounting. ''Quicker action would not have totally solved the problem, but would have made it less,'' he said.  Lenient Regulators **********While Congress carries its share of responsibility for the industry's crisis, experts place almost equal blame on Federal and state regulators who were overwhelmed by the disaster and did not move fast enough to contain it. **********As the Bank Board tried, in the 1980's, to give sick institutions enough time to recover, it approved new regulations that most experts, in hindsight, call accounting gimmickry. Those measures hid real losses, delayed big write-downs on bad loans and permitted thrift institutions to lend at levels that far exceeded prudent lending practices. **********''In retrospect, the relaxation of controls caused, or at least facilitated, the current crisis,'' stated R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., a former economist at the Bank Board, and Andrew S. Carron, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation, in a report for the Brookings Institution last year. **********In 1980, for example, the Bank Board lowered the minimum capital requirements for thrifts to 4 percent of total assets, from 5 percent. Then in 1982, they were lowered again, to 3 percent. This was done to permit savings and loans to operate in a time of stress without disciplinary intervention, but lower capital ratios permitted institutions to lend at riskier levels. Instead of having a safety cushion of capital equal to $1 for every $20 of loans, they could make $33 in loans for every dollar in capital. **********But the Bank Board then decided that was not enough to keep weakened institutions above water until a general economic recovery. Starting in 1982, it began liberalizing the industry's accounting rules, among other things permitting savings and loans to delay, sometimes for years, the reporting of losses from bad loans, and enabling them to overstate the value of their assets. **********The rationale, once again, was to enable scores of savings and loans, at least on paper, to keep their net worths up so that the Bank Board would not have to shut them down. **********But as Mr. Brumbaugh noted in his most recent book, ''Thrifts Under Seige,'' the accounting techniques merely papered over weaknesses in the real market value of the industry. **********Finally, the Bank Board refused to halt the most egregious accounting practice of all, a system by which an institution's minimum capital requirement could be calculated as 3 percent of the five-year average of its assets. This had been a common practice during the 1950's and 60's, when the growth of thrift institutions was incremental. But by the 1980's, as asset growth exploded, five-year averaging meant that an institution could maintain capital levels at only a fraction of the 3 percent minimum. **********Eric I. Hemel, former chief economist for the Bank Board and now an analyst at First Boston, said the five-year average permitted savings and loans to leverage their capital at a 150-to-1 rate. He also said longstanding practices allowed savings and loans to record large origination fees when they made risky loans and show very healthy profits, despite having almost no net worth. **********''Of the 25 thrifts showing the largest accounting profits in 1984, a majority were bankrupt by 1987,'' Mr. Hemel said. **********Once the industry discovered the magic of growth in the early 1980's, it solicited high-priced deposits, and then poured them into the booming Texas economy. The American Diversified Savings Bank of Costa Mesa, Calif., which was shut down last week by the Bank Board, was a prime example. Begun in June 1983 by Ranbir S. Sahni, a former Indian Air Force and commercial pilot, the institution grew to $1 billion in two years, investing depositor funds in such high-risk ventures as wind-mill farms, ethanol plants, restaurants and a venture that collected manure for a co-generation plant in Chino, Calif. **********Almost no one argues that the Federal and state regulators failed in duties to oversee the industry's explosive and permissive growth. Moreover, regulators failed to recognize a crucial lesson about deregulation: When an industry is permitted new powers and less Government control over its activities, the Government must step up its policing mechanism. **********Facing explosive growth in lending, thrift examiners - from the Bank Board and the state agencies - were underpaid and undertrained; there were also not enough of them. The annual starting pay of Bank Board examiners in the early 1980's averaged about $14,000. And Reagan Adminstration budget cuts trimmed the staff just when the Bank Board needed skilled personnel the most. **********''When the Bank Board went to the Office of Management and Budget for additional personnel, or to the Office of Personnel Management for permission to increase salary scales, they ran into strenuous opposition,'' said William B. O'Connell, president of the United States League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest trade group. **********By 1984, the Bank Board began to realize how large the problem was. But by then, the assets of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, used to shut thrifts and pay depositors, had begun to dwindle to finance the closures of almost 500 institutions in the previous five years. **********Beginning in 1985, the Bank Board - finally recognizing that leniency would only deepen the problem - began trying to institute regulatory changes to reverse the loose accounting measures and to restore credibility to the industry's balance sheets. It approved regulations that limited the amount of direct investment that savings and loans could make in building projects; limited the amount that they could grow each year; phased in increases in minimum capital requirements to 6 percent, and phased out regulatory accounting principles and ushered in a return to generally accepted accounting practices. **********But many argue that the measures were too few - and too late. Failure to recognize the problems sooner meant the insolvent institutions were piling losses higher. **********''The losses in Texas are averaging $500 million a month, and they get bigger with time until you finally do something about it,'' said William K. Black, senior associate general counsel at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. ''That is the magic of compound interest, and the blood letting will continue. You get very scary numbers.''  The Industry's Role **********In Jimmy Stewart's movie, ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' the local building and loan society brought joy and prosperity to the middle-class town of Bedford Falls. Residents were prudent savers, homes were built - and the ending couldn't have been happier. **********Hollywood would be hard-pressed to make such a movie today. Instead it would have to show a crippled industry whose members include thrift owners wooing members of Congress, building huge, high-risk projects and, not infrequently, engaging in kickbacks, land-flips and other fraudulent acts. **********Unlike bankers, executives in the thrift industry are permitted to run their institutions as funding operations for their personal businesses and investments. Banking regulators place severe restrictions on the extent that a bank can lend to its executives. But such stringent rules have not traditionally existed for savings and loan associations. **********In the case of the North American Savings and Loan Association of Costa Mesa, Calif., closed last week, the Bank Board has filed a lawsuit against the estate of its late owner, Duayne D. Christensen, who died last year in a car accident, and his business associate and companion, Janet F. McKinzie, charging them with funneling $40 million out of the institution for their personal use. **********Bank Board officials say that 75 percent of the thrift insolvencies include fraud or criminal conduct. ''That does not mean 75 percent of the failures are caused by fraud, but in 75 percent, fraud is a contributing factor,'' said Mr. Black. Fraud has cropped up all over the country, but Bank Board officials say it has been most apparent in Texas, California and Florida, which have the most liberal investment regulations for their state-charterd thrifts, and the weakest state regulators. **********In Texas, although obtaining permission to open a new thrift institution was next to impossible, it was ''particularly easy'' to buy an existing one, with little interference from regulators, Mr. Wall said. Kenneth Littlefield, the state's banking commissioner, said this created a hot market for insolvent thrifts among speculators, ''who could buy them for a song, and immediately use brokered deposits and high rates to raise a lot of money that they would the loan to their buddies.'' **********Critics say that some industry executives urged Congress and regulators to go easy on the entire industry, and thus jeopardized the industry's safety and soundness. ''This industry has been constantly fighting for weakness in regulation and supervision,'' said Mr. Black. ''They got it and now they are finding that the sins of the crazies are visited on the strong.'' **********''At each and every step along the process, the industry argued for forbearance,'' added Mr. Brumbaugh, now an independent consultant. ''It's been steadfast in opposing acknowledgement of how deep the problem is and that a large part of the problem will have to be remedied by closing many institutions.'' **********Since 1985, the industry frequently opposed Bank Board policies it considered too punative or costly. That conflict came to a head last year, in the debate over the rescue of the F.S.L.I.C. The Bank Board and the Treasury Department supported a $15 billion rescue package for the F.S.L.I.C., while the industry - which would pay for the borrowing authority - sought a a $5 billion rescue. In the end, a compromise $10.8 billion was reached. ''A lot of pressure came from the industry and in many instances the Congress went along,'' said Sen. Proxmire. ''The industry makes big contributions and they know how to concentrate on the right people of the right committee.'' **********During the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the interests of the regulators and the industry were essentially identical. Since the Bank Board's mandate was to promote homebuilding, whatever promoted it was considered good regulatory policy. But many analysts say the close relationship that developed between regulators and the industry ultimately proved too close - and expensive. **********In the early 1980's, as hundreds of savings and loans neared disaster, it was hard for the industry to endorse policies that would have closed many weak institutions. ''Remember that the U.S. League represents the strongest and the weakest, and they have to try to be everything to everybody,'' said Mr. Wall of the Bank Board. **********It proved to be a recipe for disaster.  NET WORTH **********Negative net worth of insolvent F.S.L.I.C.-insured savings and loans, based on generally accepted accounting principles. In billions of dollars. 1988 is N.Y.

Congress responds by deregulating interest rates. Bank Board drops minimum capital requirements to 4 percent from 5 percent.  1981: Bank Board permits thrift units to make variable-rate mortgages.  1982: Congress and some states permit thrift institutions to enter new businesses, such as direct lending to commercial real estate. Bank Board eases accounting and capital requirements further. More than 250 institutions fail.  1983: As interest rates fall, thrift institutions pour billions into risky Texas, Florida and California real estate development.  1984: Bank Board studies show hundreds of insolvent thrift institutions nationwide. The board's examination force is cut. Oil prices and Texas economy begin to collapse.  1985: Regulators, realizing there are hundreds of insolvent thrift units, start passing regulations that inhibit risky lending, excessive growth and lenient accounting practices. Bank Board begins talk of recapitalization.  1986: Texas economy badly depressed. Thrift units' losses mount nationwide, led by Texas. At year end, F.S.L.I.C. liabilities exceed assets by $6 billion.  1987: Congress permits F.S.L.I.C. to borrow $10.8 billion to shut insolvent thrift institutions, but F.S.L.I.C. losses reach $13.7 billion.  1988: Spring: Bank Board acknowledges it has 515 insolvent thrifts. It estimates total losses at $20 billion while other industry experts estimate losses as high as $70 billion.

An alumnus of Morgan State University, a predominantly black school in Baltimore, Professor Bowen, who is black, has a dual perspective.

''I think you come right out of the blocks only fiercer,'' said Ernest G. Wiggins, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Value Fund. **********Indeed, even though Friday's market was extremely quiet, rumors about many companies circulated among arbitragers and traders. Shares of drug companies were especially active and executives at SmithKline Beckman, for instance, were forced to issue a statement denying that the company would be acquired. The stock has been the subject of many rumors in recent months as it has traded from $51 down to $43 and back up again to $51. Mountain of Cash **********If the bidding frenzy resumes, arbitragers are sitting on a mountain of cash that could quickly be put to work in announced or rumored deals. In recent weeks, institutions, individuals and arbitrage firms have received almost $14 billion in cash from trading in takeover and stock buyback companies, Salomon Brothers said. **********This includes $170 million from the management-led buyout of Foodmaker Inc., $12.9 billion from the takeover of Kraft by Philip Morris Inc., $110 million from the takeover of Coast America by American Hoist and Derrick, $403.8 million from the buyback of 20 million shares of Pennwalt and $67.1 million from the buyback of 3 million shares of Archer Daniels Midland. **********So far, traders and arbitragers say, very little of this cash has been channeled back into the stock market. The arbitrage firms that have received their payments, for example, have been setting aside much of their cash in Treasury bills. With their big gains from deals this year, they are wary of buying shares of rumored targets at this point, recalling the heavy losses in takeover stocks in late 1987 after the market collapsed in October and in late 1986 when Ivan F. Boesky was accused in the insider trading scandal. Cries for Reform **********Traders are so convinced that the buyout binge will continue that they are virtually ignoring the cries for reform in Washington. They think that the legislators and regulators who have expressed concerns about the size and financing of these buyouts will likely be unable or unwilling to take the measures necessary to slow the pace. ''I don't see any configuration of potential laws that you can pass to stop this,'' Mr. Wiggins of Fidelity said. **********The calls for hearings may even force some buyers to step up their plans for acquisitions before the hearings, they say. ''It's not going to stop and it's not going to go away,'' Mr. Kroll said. **********The expectations of many professional investors are so strong that they do not even worry about the outcome of the Drexel Burnham Lambert case. Many of the buyouts in the past have been financed with high-yield ''junk bonds'' distributed by Drexel. On Friday, rumors that the firm was close to a settlement with Federal prosecutors ran through the market. Void Can Be Filled **********But traders say other bond dealers, like Goldman, Sachs & Company, the First Boston Corporation and Morgan Stanley & Company can quickly fill any void if Drexel were to be forced by the Government to cut back its operations. They point to the fact that the junk bond market barely reacted last summer when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed its long-awaited enforcement action against Drexel for insider trading. **********Indeed, bids for companies will probably continue because there is so much capital available for these transactions. The pools of equity capital raised by the dozens of leveraged buyout funds, for example, have an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion. Included in this group are the firms that lost out in the battle for RJR Nabisco Inc. **********These firms - Shearson Lehman Hutton, Forstmann Little & Company and First Boston - still have large buyout funds that they can use to acquire companies. Some on Wall Street think that the executives at some of these firms may feel compelled to prove to clients and investors that they can put together a large transaction. **********Some portfolio managers think that the attention of corporate and financial buyers will continue to be on consumer-oriented companies with strong cash flow from existing products. ''Every consumer company I can think of says it wants to make acquisitions,'' said Robert M. Raiff, managing director of research at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., who analyzes companies' breakup values. Size of Future Deals **********While many agree that the buyouts are likely to continue, they disagree about the size of any future deals. Because of the furor raised by the size of the $25 billion RJR Nabisco deal, David N. Dreman, managing director of Dreman Value Management, argues that there will not be any more deals above $20 billion. **********''I don't think the bank lines of credit are open and that the junk bond market is big enough,'' he said. He thinks the next crop of deals will have market values of around $5 billion. **********But Mr. Kroll of SLH, for one, believes that the RJR Nabisco acquisition by the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company opens the door for much larger buyouts. He predicts takeovers with market values of $40 billion or $50 billion. He compares the buyout phenomenon to the prices paid for New York real estate. Every so often, he said, people complain that prices cannot go any higher. But so far, prices of apartments have continued to climb."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/05/business/company-news-salomon-s-plan-for-phibro-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 222, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salomon's Plan For Phibro Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Salomon's Plan For Phibro Unit", "body_text": " **********Officials from Salomon Inc. said yesterday that the firm's planned purchase of an oil refinery in Texas would make its oil subsidiary a stronger player in that industry. **********Salomon reached agreement last week for its oil subsidairy, Phibro Energy, to buy a refinery owned by the Agway Petroleum Corporation.

On board, cages, nets and gloves were at the ready to capture wild and threatened animals. **********Since the Balbina Dam in the heart of the Amazon Basin was closed last October, a large rescue operation has been under way in which thousands of animals are being coaxed, chased and caught and released on safer ground. Every day, close to 250 men go out to pluck forest creatures from drowning branches. They have trapped large constrictor snakes and grabbed monkeys, ferocious pumas, clinging sloths. **********''The rules are simple,'' said Bento Melo, a zoologist who at the prow of his launch in the jungle seemed to have the confidence of a man in his backyard. ''The animals that swim well are left alone,'' he said. ''Some we keep for study or for the zoos. All threatened species are released.'' **********As the boats swerved among palms, rosewood and wild fruit trees, the rescue team kept ducking to avoid vines and aerial roots, dangling like dangerous nooses overhead. Invisible birds screeched like parrots. ''If they are curassows we have to save them,'' Dr. Melo said. ''They cannot fly distances.'' Many Dams Are Built **********The drama of rising tides washing over huge tracts of nature is now acted out almost constantly in Brazil. Stung by the oil crisis of the 1970's and striving for energy self-sufficiency, Brazil is opening a large hydroelectric dam virtually every year. **********This nation with the greatest grid of rivers on earth has already built enough dams to provide for 95 percent of its electricity needs. And driven by a fast-growing population and the will to settle its immense spaces, Brazil has plans for at least 25 more dams. **********Such zeal has led critics at home and abroad to lament the great losses of land or undisturbed nature. Of the immense Balbina reservoir, which will produce only 250 megawatts, government experts have said that the size and the cost of the project are so enormous that the dam should never have been built. **********But here in the heart of the Amazon Basin, arguments have been overtaken as the Uatuma River is backing up and irrevocably flooding 600 square miles of jungle land. **********Racing ahead of the tides, archeologists have collected potsherds, stone axes and carved figures at 122 former Indian sites. They talked with excitement of finding a muiriquita, a small, rare stone carving that is linked to the legend of the Amazon female warriors. But they expressed regret about two caves, now flooded, that showed rock drawings in red, black and white. **********Only two small tribes of forest Indians, 105 Waimiri, lived near the reservoir area, and last year they were given new lands. In the meantime, their old hunting grounds have rapidly disappeared. As four canoes prodded among the drifting logs and leaves, the half-flooded jungle seemed like a haunted forest, with the tops of palm trees emerging from the water like giant bouquets. **********''The land animals here have all fled or died,'' Dr. Melo said. ''We are looking for tree animals like primates, sloths, anteaters and felines.'' More than ever, he said, the treetops were brimming with insects, lizards, scorpions, tarantulas. **********Almost immediately this was underlined as the launch hit a stem and a rain of ants, spiders and bugs poured down on the occupants. Two furry spiders, the size of a saucer, were quickly put into jars. Big? No, that was nothing. Crew members had caught two stunning and glowing black beetles, larger than their own hands. ''Tianus Gigante,'' Dr. Melo said. ''The biggest beetle in the world.'' **********Estela Lazarina, a veterinarian at the dam's biological station, had earlier shown other captives that had not been freed: a pair of rodents that were altogether unknown, a tapir and a sloth with wounds that were being treated, and 20 healthy bushmasters, highly dangerous equatorial vipers up to four yards long. Some of the snakes, Dr. Lazarina said, would be used to prepare poison antidotes. Some Oppose Operation **********Whether rescuing and moving animals to other parts of a region is a desirable undertaking has been a matter of debate. Some scientists have argued that such operations disturb nature's balance and that animals are killed anyway as a greater population is forced to fight over territory, females or food. **********''We may know more in a few years,'' said Dr. Melo, noting that many specimens had been given markers. ''But laboratory models and theories don't work here,'' he added. ''No one has any idea how many animals there are in an area, how much life it can sustain.'' **********The unexpected ways of the forest hit home minutes later as the canoe crashed into a branch, home to a colony of wasps. Instantly, hundreds swooped down on the passengers. They left swollen, acid burns on every face and limb. **********On the way home, as a rainstorm lashed down and blissfully cooled the stinging wounds, Dr. Melo pointed to the moving shoreline. There were large herons and egrets that had just discovered the newborn lake. The most dramatic changes were still to come, Dr. Melo said, as he waved with the gesture of a prophet to the miles of rain forest.

Shearson's investment amounts to a 46 percent interest in BNS. 'Deep Regret' **********In protest, Koppers bought newspaper advertisements last week displaying a letter written by G. Davis Greene Jr., the Pennsylvania treasurer, expressing ''deep regret'' at Shearson's involvement in the partnership with Beazer. **********Pennsylvania officials complain that the partnership between Beazer and Shearson puts the investment banking firm in the dual role of conceiving a hostile takeover and acting as an equity participant in the deal. Citing Beazer's intention to sell the company's chemical business if it gained control of Koppers, the state officials also contend that a takeover would lead to the layoff of many of Koppers's 1,100 employees in the Pittsburgh area. **********While Koppers officials said the company is reviewing the most recent bid, state officials have become more active in efforts to block the Beazer offer by getting Shearson to pull out. Last Wednesday, Mr. Greene canceled all business activities between Pennsylvania's investment office and Shearson and its subdidiaries. He also expressed concern to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission about Shearson's role as the commission's co-financial adviser. State Business With Shearson **********In addition, on Friday Gov. Robert P. Casey ordered that Shearson be dropped from consideration as a potential adviser for a pending bond issue because the company is involved in the Koppers acquisition. Mr. Casey further called for a Congressional investigation on Shearson's role in the takeover attempt. **********''We will not stand by while corporate raiders rake in millions by selling off productive Pennsylvania companies and putting productive Pennsylvania people out of work,'' Mr. Casey said. **********And Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri of Pittsburgh said he may seek to bar city employees from using American Express credit cards. The American Express Company is Shearson's parent. Shearson Responds **********For their part, Shearson officials have stated that their arrangement with Beazer is not particularly unusual. ''The misunderstanding is that we are seeking to acquire Koppers and that we are acting as a principal,'' said Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for Shearson. ''We're just providing bridge financing for the company,'' meaning that they will eventually sell their stake in BNS to Beazer. **********Many Wall Street analysts have said that Shearson's arrangement with Koppers is only a small step beyond what investment banks have been doing for some time. Shearson's role is mainly to provide financing, they said, and it is not acting improperly. **********''Investment banks have been making bridge loans on a number of deals for years,'' said one analyst who follows Kopppers. ''In this case the terms of the arrangement makes it clear that Shearson's equity in the deal will be repaid. What you're seeing is a group of politicians who are trying to make some political points with the voters.'' The Threat of Layoffs **********The officials have contended that the company created in the deal would be so highly leveraged that it would be forced to sell parts of itself to pay its debt, leading to less business activity and layoffs of employees. But analysts suggested that it was unlikely Beazer would greatly shrink the company if its acquisition is successful, since the British company has a history of high growth. **********Mr. Greene, who was appointed state treasurer early last year by Mr. Casey to complete the term of R. Budd Dwyer, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, denied that he has been motivated by political considerations. The treasurer, who formerly headed his own investment counseling firm, has said he would not run for the post in a November election. **********''I'm not too thrilled about the prospect of a foreign company coming into this state and buying up companies,'' Mr. Greene said. ''I really object to them being led by Shearson in this kind of matter. And Shearson, in this case, needs to be accountable.'' **********Richard M. Cyert, president of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a member of the Koppers board, said the takeover effort has become an emotional issue in the Pittsburgh area because residents remember the widespread layoffs in the steel industry in the last decade as well as the closing of Gulf Oil's headquarters operation in 1985 after the company was taken over by the Chevron Corporation. **********''Pittsburgh has lost a number of headquarters and a number of companies have scaled back,'' Mr. Cyert said.

Representative Dick Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, a member of the Intelligence panel, said he no longer intends to force a debate and vote in the full House on a resolution intended to force the ethics panel to begin an investigation. **********The controversy began when Mr. Wright told reporters that ''we have received clear testimony from C.I.A. people'' about the covert action, which he described as intended to bring an end to faltering peace talks between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels. **********In his letter to Mr. Dixon, Mr. Wright said his reference to ''clear testimony'' referred to 1985 testimony by ''C.I.A. personnel'' before the World Court. **********Mr. Wright did not name the personnel in the letter, but has previously referred to testimony by a former C.I.A. analyst, David MacMichael, before the Court in 1985. **********Mr. Wright also said ''the C.I.A. may never have formally acknowledged'' an intent to provoke Sandinista overreaction and arrests, as Mr. Wright asserted in his comments to reporters, ''in any of its testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and it is my impression that Congress has never authorized such activities.'' **********In earlier statements, Mr. Wright said he had a moral obligation to speak out about actions of the Administration that he thinks are wrong, and has sought to turn the debate to the question of whether it is proper to express support publicly for the peace process while undercutting it secretly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/21/world/israel-chides-state-dept-aide-for-removing-antique-coins.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1988-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 562, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Chides State Dept.

The crowd erupted in applause even before he finished. **********The release of the hostages appears to be an important spur for the fortunes of Mr. Chirac, who has trailed the Socialist incumbent, President Francois Mitterrand, in opinion polls. Held by Pro-Iran Group **********French officials would not say what pledges or concessions had been made, if any, to win the hostages' release. **********The freed hostages are Marcel Fontaine, 45 years old; Marcel Carton, 62, and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44. Mr. Fontaine and Mr. Carton, both diplomats, were seized in March 1985; Mr. Kauffmann, a journalist for a French network, was kidnapped two months later. **********French officials have identified their captors as members of Islamic Holy War, which is believed to take some instructions from Iran. **********The three were set free near a hotel in West Beirut, the mainly Moslem part of the capital, and were reported to have left Beirut tonight by private jet. They are expected here Thursday. **********They were the last French hostages in Lebanon. More than 20 foreigners, including 9 Americans, are still believed to be held there. Another Frenchman kidnapped in 1985, Michel Seurat, a 38-year-old researcher, is reported to have been killed a year later, but his body has not been found. Hostages a Major Issue **********Speaking from Elysee Palace a few hours after the release was announced, President Mitterrand said: ''I am happy that the efforts undertaken since the beginning of this drama have finally succeeded. I thank all those who have worked for their return.'' **********In the last few days the hostage issue had become increasingly prominent in the presidential campaign, with the candidates trading accusations that the other had secretly bargained with pro-Iranian terrorists to take credit for the eventual release of hostages. **********Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who largely directed the negotiations for the hostages' release on behalf of Mr. Chirac, would not discuss how the accord had been reached. **********Various officials of Mr. Chirac's Government and in the Socialist opposition in Parliament said the release agreement included provisions for the eventual normalization of relations with Iran. France broke diplomatic relations with Iran last July in a dispute over the role of an Iranian Embassy employee in a wave of terrorist bombings in Paris in September 1986. **********Officials also indicated that the agreement for the hostages' release involved the final payments of an outstanding $1 billion loan made by the Shah of Iran to the French Government in 1974 for a nuclear project, and apparently an agreement to release Anis Naccache, who was imprisoned for a 1980 attempt to kill a former Iranian Prime Minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar. Repayment an Iranian Demand **********The Paris weekly Canard Enchaine reported last month that France had made a second payment of $300 million on the loan. Mr. Chirac's Government announced soon after its election in 1986 that it had authorized an initial repayment of $330 million. Repayment of the loan has been one of Iran's main demands since the revolutionary regime took power in 1979. **********In the last few weeks, talks with the kidnappers, Syria and Iran appeared to ebb and flow, with several announcements of the imminent release of the hostages ending in disappointment. **********Although Mr. Mitterrand as President has overall responsibility for foreign policy, the day-to-day running of the Government is strictly the responsibility of the Prime Minister, so it is Mr. Chirac who has overseen all the negotiations on the hostages' release. **********The negotiations were handled by Mr. Pasqua, who oversees the French secret service, after efforts by the Foreign Ministry to resolve the case through diplomatic channels proved fruitless. His principal representative in the talks, Jean-Charles Marchiani, has made repeated trips to Lebanon. **********It was Mr. Marchiani who negotiated the release of two other French captives, Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin, last November. **********Omrane Adham, a Syrian businessman who has acted as intermediary for the French governments under President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Chirac in hostage negotiations, said the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner last month by pro-Iranian gunmen had delayed the hostages' release. **********On Tuesday, France expelled Mr. Adham, saying his presence was a ''particularly grave menace to public order.'' Mr. Adham, a confidant of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, has lived here since 1978 and travels on a Syrian diplomatic passport. He was expelled under a special security procedure of ''absolute urgency.'' French and Arab officials said he left for Switzerland today. **********Asked to comment on the expulsion in a radio interview today, Mr. Pasqua said only that France ''cannot accept anyone of foreign nationality in our territory who, by his actions, hampers the efforts of the French Government and risks causing harm to those who are being held hostage.''

Volume was heavy yesterday, but was somewhat distorted by strong takeover activity and heavy trading in several utility stocks designed to capture their dividends. **********The Dow jumped 48.41 points, or 2.39 percent, to close at 2,071.62. It was the Dow's second-best gain this year, topped only by the 76.42-point run-up on Jan. 4. On Jan. 7, the Dow closed at 2,051.89, the highest level it had has attained since the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19. Since that early January advance, the Dow - which plunged 140.58 points the very next day - has traded narrowly, repeatedly stalling at the 2,050 level. **********Some analysts were encouraged by yesterday's advance. They argued that, although hundreds of billions of dollars in stock values evaporated during the market plunge, there was still plenty of cash on the sidelines that might find its way into stocks if interest rates eased and money managers felt the pressure to improve their portfolios' performance. **********''The market right now is very similar to late June 1987,'' one trader said. ''A lot of people then thought there was very little value. However, a lot of people had not participated. There was a lot of cash around. They were forced into the market. The market ran up to 2,700 and presented the best opportunity to sell in the past 50 years. If the market goes up now, it could force the institutions into the market again.'' **********But, ''I wouldn't want to overstay my welcome'' if there were a strong rally, the trader added. **********''Somebody is putting cash to work,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of the stock index futures department at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Mr. Grennan said there was very little risk arbitrage program trading yesterday, but noted that ''every stock index future'' closed at a discount to the cash market and said that could lead to a Wall Street selloff today. **********With much of the market activity yesterday coming from takeover stories, real and rumored, some analysts said they doubted that the stock market was ready to take off. ''It is unlikely that the market can rally from these levels, unless we see greater volume and enthusiasm,'' said William J. King, senior vice president for trading at Nikko Securities. **********Of yesterday's strong volume -236.1 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, up from 158.1 million shares Friday -almost 60 million shares of big-dividend stocks were traded. Japanese and American institutions buy huge blocks of high-yielding utility stocks as part of sophisticated tax strategies revolving around their dividends. **********Much of the other volume was in takeover issues. And that also bothers Mr. King. ''The market has a constitution similar to the period just prior to the October crash,'' he said. ''It is being dominated by traders, takeover rumors, a questionable economy and equities that are at or near historically overvalued areas. On the plus side, interest rates are lower, but a tremendous amount of capital has been destroyed.'' **********Some traders said they would await today's report on the index of leading indicators and Friday's employment figures before making any judgment about the economy - and the stock market. They pointed out that a disappointing employment figure preceded the big Jan. 8 selloff. **********Other traders said that stocks might have received their impetus from the confluence of two opposite predictions. Elaine M. Garzarelli, the Shearson analyst who is widely credited with ''calling'' the October crash, has turned bullish, while Robert Prechter, an influential market newsletter writer with a large following, has been urging clients to sell stocks short. With the market moving higher, traders said, many of Mr. Prechter's clients might be buying back in. Such short covering can add fuel to a market rally. **********The Big Board composite index rose 2.76, to 150.46, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.36, to 267.82.

And many of the costs occur during maternity leave, when a family is living on one income instead of two. **********''Having a baby affects every single aspect of your life,'' Linadria Miriam, a mother of two, as well as a consumer specialist for the bank, told a group of parents-to-be at the Children's Museum of Manhattan. Chemical Bank has been holding seminars for prospective parents on ''financial fitness'' to show that with careful financial planning and judicious use of credit, a family can avoid being overwhelmed by the costs of a baby. Ms. Miriam offered a a number of suggestions: *********** ''Re-evaluate your health insurance. If you have regular medical insurance, your policy will probably cover about 80 percent of your pregnancy costs. But regular health insurance plans hardly ever pay for well-baby care, which can be quite expensive for the first couple of years. However, H.M.O.'s do cover these routine costs, so you might find that it's time to switch to an H.M.O.'' *********** ''Review your life insurance plans,'' she said. ''Many people say your life insurance should be equal to about five times your annual salary,'' but it may be advisable to carry more in the early years of a child's life and scale back later. And ''in a two-income family, both providers need to be adequately insured,'' she said. ''In fact, if one parent should die prematurely, studies show that the family's living costs would probably increase rather than decrease.'' *********** ''Update your estate planning,'' she urged. ''As a parent it's extremely important to prepare a will - not just to designate your heirs but to name a legal guardian who would care for your children if you and your spouse died. Unless you have a will or a living trust, the court system must step in and appoint a guardian.'' *********** 'Reassess your benefit packages at work,'' she said, to take advantage of everything that is available, particularly when the employer will pay part of the cost. If a pretax savings plan, like a 401(k) plan, is offered, it is a good idea to take advantage of that for the family's long-term financial security, she said. Having a baby means re-evaluating savings and investment plans and perhaps becoming more conservative. **********There are also many supplies to buy - diapers, cribs, bassinets, strollers, car seats. The bank prepared a three-page list to help parents get organized. And many families begin thinking about a larger house or apartment, not only with an extra room for the child but also one for a nanny, as well as larger kitchens and more bathrooms. Many couples also want larger and safer cars when they begin to have children. **********''These expenses can really add up and create a financial squeeze,'' Ms. Miriam said, especially if everything is charged to a credit card with an 18 or 20 percent interest rate. In 1989, only 20 percent of the interest will be tax deductible. In future years, there will be no tax deduction. **********But the greatest costs for working couples are likely to be for child care. ''Full-time child care in the home may average up to $325 a week, or about $17,000 a year, and only 10 percent of these costs are tax deductible,'' she said. Also, child-care agencies charge a finder's fee of four to six weeks' salary, and employers are expected to pay two weeks' vacation and Social Security taxes of 7.51 percent. **********An ''au pair'' can live with a family and provide child care for only $150 a week plus the costs of her meals. But Federal law allows an au pair to work for a family for only a year at a time, which means frequent readjustments for the child, she said. **********Ms. Miriam recommended that parents look at the projected costs for all the items that must be bought for the baby, including the big family expenses like cars and housing and the continuing expenses for child care, clothing, food and medical expenses. Then prepare a budget. **********Those who do not have the cash to buy everything will have to forgo some purchases or turn to credit, and it is important to look at the comparitive costs of various types of credit. Homeowners who have enough equity built up in their home -generally more than 20 percent of the property's value - can take out home-equity loans and deduct the interest. Margin loans on securities are also available at lower interest rates than personal loans, and investment interest is deductible to the extent it is matched by investment income. **********''One of the newer types of home-equity loans gives you all the speed and simplicity of a regular personal installment loans, plus tax advantages,'' Ms. Miriam said. At Chemical, for instance, homeowners can borrow up to $25,000 and co-op owners up to $20,000 at a fixed rate without points, lawyer's fees or large application fees, she said. **********But, Ms. Miriam cautioned, ''it's important to prevent overspending,'' adding, ''After all, credit isn't free.'' Stick to a budget and do little money-saving things, she said, like clipping coupons in the Sunday newspaper and comparison shopping. And because the cost of raising children grows through the years - with education looming - Ms. Miriam recommended, ''Keep learning about money management so you can build a good future for your entire family.'' **********Chemical plans to hold other seminars for prospective parents. The next one is expected to be on Long Island and may be similar to the Manhattan seminar, where Ms. Miriam and other Chemical representatives, as well as Nancy P. Gilbert, director of the Gilbert Child Care Agency Inc., answered questions from prospective parents.

But they denied that the value of the payments reached the levels claimed by the prosecution. One defendant, a former Interior Minister of Uzbekistan, Khaidar K. Yakyayev, pleaded innocent to all the charges against him. **********Judge Marov said that Mr. Churbanov would have to clarify his plea during the trial. Death Sentence Possible **********Mr. Churbanov could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of accepting bribes under especially aggravating circumstances - a category of criminal offense applied in bribery cases involving unusually large sums of money. **********He could be sentenced to a maximum of 15 years if convicted of accepting bribes under aggravating circumstances - a lesser category that can take into account the importance of an official's function and the amount and frequency of the bribes. **********The charge of simple abuse of office carries a maximum 10-year sentence, according to Mr. Churbanov's lawyer, Andrei Makarov. **********Mr. Churbanov is accused of receiving 656,883 rubles, or more than $1.1 million, in bribes from 1976 to 1982. **********The trial is widely viewed as a forum for authorities to demonstrate the degree to which official corruption flourished under Brezhnev, and it seemed unlikely that the Churbanov plea would prevent officials from accomplishing this.

Several of them asked for medical checkups, and on the first day one Uzbek defendant suffered a seizure. **********Mr. Churbanov, portrayed in the indictment as an untalented careerist who left his first wife and their child to marry ''a member of the Brezhnev family,'' has remained silent throughout the trial's opening days. **********In 1971, Mr. Churbanov, who had been one of Galina Brezhnev's personal bodyguards, became her third husband, and the first who was not a circus performer. His career advancement thereafter was rapid, culminating in his appointment to the No. 2 job in the Interior Ministry. **********The charges described routine corruption in Uzbekistan, where a pyramid structure brought officials money, jewelry, gold and other valuables from their immediate subordinates.

So in a sense, Mr. Gorbachev was coming here to see the future, and to see whether it was working. Leaning to the West **********Yugoslavia, with a 200 percent rate of inflation and a foreign debt of $21 billion, is hardly a shining economic star. But Slovenia, the northernmost Yugoslav republic, is a cash cow, and Mr. Gorbachev learned that part of the republic's recipe for success was doing business with the West. Milan Kucan, the Communist leader in Slovenia, said that $2.1 billion worth of Slovenia's $2.5 billion in exports went westward. **********Mr. Gorbachev learned, too, about the difficulties that Slovenes encountered selling goods to Russia. **********The Soviet Union represents a huge market for many of the items produced by the Iskra Electronic Company, which employs 36,000 people. The Russians have shown a particular interest in digital telephone exchanges and in processers for computer-controlled machine tools. Last year, Iskra shipped $60 million worth of goods to the Soviet Union, but the Russians have had nothing to offer in return. Last year, their deliveries to Iskra, which included a few low-quality semiconductors and some other components, totaled $1 million to $2 million. Piped-In Chat **********As Mr. Gorbachev chatted with factory managers and Communist leaders around a conference table, the talk was piped to reporters via closed-circuit television. **********This was no jarring exchange. Some of Mr. Gorbachev's questions fell apart a bit in the translation from Russian to Slovene. Much time was spent admiring a local newspaper bearing a full-page advertisement welcoming the Gorbachevs. An aide to the Soviet leader, his head cradled in his hands, appeared to slumber through the session. **********Across town, Robert Botteri, the editor of Mladina, the Slovene Communist youth magazine, had other headaches. The weekly scheduled a blistering editorial for today that was addressed, with irony, to the ''Defenders of the Revolution.'' Mr. Botteri found himself spending a good deal of time today insisting that the broadside was entirely unrelated to Mr. Gorbachev's arrival. A Regional Identity **********Hard-working Slovenia, cradled by the Alps, has often marched to a different drumbeat than most of Yugoslavia, wielding the tools of economic restructuring to pursue its own development and interests. Washed by waves of Italian and Austrian television, its Communist leaders have opened up the intellectual debate to a wider degree than is evident elsewhere in the country. **********But its leadership is under pressure from the national Government to close ideological ranks in order to better confront the nation's economic woes. **********Cataloguing the negative fruits of Communist stewardship in Yugoslavia, the editorial in Mladina noted sarcastically that, as long as the revolution offered only ''a crippled and dying economy'' and the ''infallibility of the League of Communists,'' then ''we have no choice but to act out the role of counterrevolutionaries.'' **********The upstart publication is already in hot water with the Yugoslav military for publishing articles about Government sales of arms - rather than grain - to drought-ravaged Ethiopia.

On Friday, Hospital Corporation's stock shot up $3.75, to $48.25, still well below management's latest bid of $51. **********Part of the shortfall comes from the management's intention to pay only $43 a share in cash and the balance in as yet unidentified securities. But part of the market's skepticism also comes from uncertainty as to whether a deal could be completed. Arbitragers and analysts speculated on Thursday that the offer's unusually brief duration was meant to put pressure on the company's board to act. **********Shareholders are likely to remain a bit confused by the board's neither accepting the offer nor rejecting it as unfair, especially since the management did not offer any public reassurance over the weekend that it would remain interested in a transaction after tomorrow. Nervousness Seen **********''I'm not sure which way the stock will go Monday morning,'' Mr. Hindelong said. ''You can read into this statement that a higher bid is coming. On the other hand, there are others who will become nervous with the situation.'' **********William K. Newbury, for one, does not think there is a great deal of room left for bids to rise steeply. The health care analyst with the College Retirement Equities Fund in New York, an institutional investor that owns Hospital Corporation shares, said he ''wouldn't quarrel with a price in the mid-$50's,'' but he doubted that there would be someone with all cash at that price. ''You might get $55 with $5 in paper,'' he added. ''That would be a good price.'' **********Another unknown variable in the equation has been Irving S. Shapiro, head of the special committee and former chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Mr. Shapiro has been deviating in his public comments from the usual script that guides most management-led buyout groups. For instance, it was Mr. Shapiro who disclosed on Thursday to reporters that Richard Rainwater, the Texas financier, was an investor in the management-led group after the company refused to identify any of the group's backers. 'Won't Be a Chummy Deal' **********''He clearly is attempting to demonstrate his independence,'' said Mr. Hindelong. ''Whatever happens, it won't be a chummy deal with management.'' **********''Very often in these cases the outside directors don't take the initiative,'' said Mr. Newbury, who admitted to being a little unsure as to how to interpret some of the board's statements.

A total of 151.8 million shares changed hands, which was down a bit from 152.7 million on Tuesday. **********''There are some very legitimate concerns regarding the direction of the dollar, foreign disinvestment of U.S. securities and the renewed uncertainty regarding the Presidential election, to give investors reason to pause going into the holiday weekend,'' said Kenneth S.

Zinder, a technical analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.Yields Up on Bonds **********Another factor in the stock retreat, the analysts said, was a slump in the bond market, where yields rose after two days of declines. Higher yields on fixed-income securities, particularly Treasury bonds, compete with the returns offered in the stock market. **********The rise in interest rates came amid growing concern over today's Government report on the nation's employment situation. A sharp increase in the number of people working could indicate that the economy is overheating and is inflation-prone -at least in the eyes of the Federal Reserve. **********Bond and stock investors are warily watching the Fed for any sign that it may raise the discount rate, the rate at which the central bank lends to financial institutions, to cool the economy's expansion. **********The perception that interest rates have peaked, some of the analysts said, was behind the Dow's rally earlier this week.Theory Is Disputed **********But not everyone agrees with that theory. Some of the analysts contend that the stock market's recent rally was nothing but a technical bounce in an otherwide desultory, oversold bear market. They noted that the Dow has been caught in a trading range of between 1,950 and 2,100 for months, and said that the strength of the rally owed more to the discomfiture of the short-sellers who were forced to buy back shares than to anything fundamental. **********The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.36, to 265.33, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.67, to 149.67.

About 30 million shares on the Big Board yesterday were involved in so-called dividend capture plays.Rise in 'Asset Plays' **********The traders noted that ''asset plays'' - like gold, silver and copper issues - rose sharply yesterday, in step with the recent increases in commodity prices that have also rekindled fears of inflation. ASA Ltd. rose 1 1/2, to 46 1/8; Callahan Mining 2, to 19; Hecla Mining 1 3/8, to 15 3/4, and Phelps Dodge 1 1/4, to 41 7/8. **********The rise in such inflation hedges, the traders said, was also spurred by the news that the Japanese Government had increased the margin requirement for stocks traded in Tokyo to 70 percent from 60 percent to try to cool that soaring stock market. **********John A. Conlon Jr., the head of equities trading for Nikko Securities Company International in New York, said that, while the margin move ''was somewhat anticipated,'' it ''will probably exacerbate'' any pullback that now hits the Tokyo market. ''There was a growing feeling that the market was poised for a correction,'' he said. **********Indeed, Justin Mamis, a technical analyst for Cowen & Company, has suggested that the recent weakness in the Japanese stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange was a sign of an imminent decline in Tokyo. In New York yesterday, Matsushita Electric fell 4, to 201; Hitachi 2 1/8, to 109 7/8, and Honda 2, to 137.Burlington Northern Up **********Elsewhere on the Big Board, Burlington Northern gained 1 3/4, to 69 1/8. The Seattle-based company reported plans to sell 13 percent of its Burlington Resources operation to the public. **********Texaco fell 1 3/4, to 50 5/8, after Carl C.

Such a plane would travel at five times the speed of sound, or nearly 4,000 miles an hour. That is about two and a half times the speed of the Concorde, currently the world's fastest passenger plane. **********In his 1986 State of the Union address, President Reagan surprised the American aerospace industry by endorsing the development of an ''Orient Express,'' a plane capable of cutting the flying time between New York and Tokyo to 2 or 3 hours from the current 13. Despite budget cutbacks, the Pentagon last year began issuing contracts to develop components of a prototype plane, formally called the X-30. No International Aid **********In interviews today, officials of Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry, which led the nation's advances in automobiles, semiconductors, supercomputers and artificial intelligence, denied that they were directly competing with the Orient Express. But they quickly added that during the initial stages of the project Japan's aircraft manufacturers would work without international assistance. **********''Right now, we still need to develop basic technology,'' said Yoshikazu Goto, a senior official of MITI's aircraft division. ''But once production begins, no one could support the project by themselves, not the Americans and not the Europeans. We will have to work together.'' **********''We don't plan to dominate this field by ourselves,'' Mr. Goto added. ''We will be sharing the risk, and sharing the technology.'' **********Japan itself has so far been unable to develop a viable domestic aircraft industry. And last year, over substantial domestic opposition, the Government agreed to base its new FSX fighter on a version of the General Dynamics F-16, rather than to develop a wholly Japanese fighter. Thus there is heavy pressure here to develop a distinctly Japanese technology for the hypersonic plane. Budget Austerity **********Mr. Goto and other MITI officials cautioned that the Government had not given its final blessing to the initiative, which comes at a time of some budget austerity here. The national budget is not set until December. But one senior Government official said the project had already survived several reviews, and that the initiative was a ''high priority.'' **********''The main question is how much we can afford to spend,'' he said. **********Japan's answer is likely to attract enormous attention among American scientists and military officials, some of whom complain that financing for the American plane is being siphoned away by the enormous cost of getting the space shuttle flying again and building a space station. **********At the same time, there are significant differences in the American and Japanese programs. The United States is seeking to build a ''spaceplane'' to serve as a military aircraft and as a possible successor to the shuttle. The Pentagon's most ambitious plans call for a craft that can travel at up to Mach 25, or 25 times the speed of sound, and operate outside the earth's atmosphere. MITI's primary interest is in a commercial plane that can fly at up to Mach 5, reaching altitudes of about 15 miles. 'Really Just Beginning' **********However, Japan's science and technology agency has a small spaceplane project under way as well. ''We are really just beginning,'' Hiroshi Endo, the director of the aerodynamics division at the national aerospace laboratory, said today. ''The technical base for this work still does not exist in this country.'' **********The MITI plan would draw on Japan's considerable research in composite materials and ceramics, with an eye to designing a fuselage capable of withstanding enormous heat. Meanwhile, engine design work will fall mainly to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, officials said. No Guarantee of Success **********MITI's involvement does not guarantee success. The agency is best known for its phenomenal achievements in organizing Japan's semiconductor chip makers, a success so complete that it has come back to haunt the agency in trade negotiations. But some other MITI efforts have had mixed results. **********The Fifth Generation project, a major initiative in artificial intelligence, has endured budget cuts and technological disappointments, and no longer appears so fearsome. Similarly, the Superspeed project to develop supercomputers has also proved disappointing. **********On the other hand, MITI remains a powerful force in getting Japanese industry to focus on long-term challenges and to avoid duplicate research. By turning its attention to hypersonic aircraft, MITI virtually obliges major industrial groups here to develop their own plans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/04/business/president-quits-at-firestone.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President Quits At Firestone", "print_headline": "President Quits At Firestone", "body_text": " **********The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company said today that its president, Albert E.

Among other things, the United States has described Unesco as a forum for anti-Western leftist attitudes like global restrictions on press freedom and a haven of political patronage, waste and mismanagement. **********Third-world diplomats say that condescending views held by the West on issues of importance to developing nations, such as the flow of information, racism, human dignity and education, are a bone of contention transcending the excesses of Mr. M'Bow that led the West to press for his ouster last year. A Shrinking Budget **********Unesco's shrinking budget is barely enough to pay the salaries of 2,500 demoralized staff members, who are waiting for the time when the so-called ''North-South confrontation'' comes to an end and Unesco finds a sense of direction. **********''It would be going much too far to say that Unesco has an efficient and effective program,'' said Richard T. Miller, the United States observer. **********He asserted that it was too early to talk about ending the four-year boycott of the organization and the suspension of American financial contributions, which accounted for 25 percent of the unit's budget. **********''Our policy is to wait and see what happens,'' he said. ''We are pleased the organization has a new director who is friendly to the West. But the organization's program itself hasn't changed.'' Britain Not Ready to Return **********Britain, the other leading Western country that withrew in 1985 from Unesco in protest against Mr. M'Bow, is also said by senior officials to be a long way from returning. **********Beyond the political schism that divides Unesco, all members seem to share a concern that the organization badly needs a managerial overhaul. **********Critics assert that the 53-year-old Mr. Mayor, a Spanish biochemist and intellectual who took over in November as director general, has been too timid in his approach to administrative changes. Critics say he has held on to Mr. M'Bow's circle of inefficient administrators and spends much of his time traveling. Many say he has not done enough to end the drift. **********A spokesman for Mr. Mayor, Leon Davicho, director of Unesco's office of public information, said he was moving as fast as possible to put changes into effect, adding that ''13 years leaves deep imprints.'' Mr. M'Bow held the office for 13 years. 'Requires Political Experience' **********''The job of the director general demands a certain political experience,'' said Aziz al-Haaj, Iraq's representative. ''Mr. Mayor must realize that what happened is a change of authority from someone who turned Unesco into a personal fiefdom to a new man who has obligations to clean it up from parasites. In that sense, Mayor has not completely taken charge yet and I hope he will do it.'' **********But what everyone agrees on is that the discord that reigns here centers on the role of Unesco. **********The West would like it to limit itself to strictly defined cultural and technical projects, such as the successful rescue of the mammoth Egyptian Pharaonic monument of Abu Simbel 20 years ago, when it was threatened by the rising Nile. 'An Intellectual Organization' **********The third world sees it as a full-fledged forum for debating the big issues of the times. ''This is an intellectual organization,'' said India's Unesco representative, Arundhati Ghose. **********''Unesco must make its own contribution to issues like apartheid, racism, media and education,'' she said. ''You cannot say apartheid is a purely political issue and therefore what is happening to young people in South Africa is no longer our business.'' **********The United States and Britain, however, argue that politics belongs with the United Nations in New York, and that there is enough of it there. **********''Why is Unesco always debating the Middle East problem?'' Mr. Miller said. ''That sort of debate, when it takes over an organization, destroys its ability to work. It makes the organization useless.'' 'New World Information Order' **********By far the most contentious issue in the last few years in Western eyes has been Unesco's attempt to form a ''new world information order.'' Third-world countries that have long complained that Western news organizations concentrate on negative aspects of their development teamed up with the Eastern bloc to forge a new code of journalistic behavior. Although no concrete action has resulted, the pursuit of this effort is viewed ominously. **********''The new information order has become a reference point to legitimize the reach of regimes against a free press,'' a Western European representative said. **********But third-world representatives argue that their only intention is to find ways to strengthen their feeble media capacities to balance unsympathetic Western press reports. ''The problem has been that the press itself got involved as a party in this issue, so much so that we are censored in our use of words,'' Miss Ghose of India said. **********The Western coalition also argues that Unesco is wasting meager resources chasing after too many grandiose, but useless, programs. These range from mammoth enterprises like the eradication of illiteracy to such esoteric issues as the merits of individual human rights as opposed to nations' rights. Some 30 or 40 Projects **********''At the moment we've got 30 or 40 projects, some of which are supported by as little as $5,000 so that the project is reduced to sloganeering,'' Mr. al-Haaj of Iraq said. Unesco's 51-member executive board met recently to review the organization's plans for 1990 to 1995. Although many officials said the new relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States seems to have lowered tension, the third-world group appeared as militant as ever in its demand that Unesco continues to play a major political role. **********''The fact of the matter is that if the West had complete ideological domination of this organization, as it used to have many years ago, you won't have all of this Western whining and complaining about Unesco,'' Mr. al-Haaj said. ''It is a matter of which views are dominant.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/16/world/talking-with-plo-un-ends-its-session-geneva-approving-2-mideast-resolutions.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 704, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Mr. Arafat addressed the Assembly on Tuesday. **********His statement at a news conference here Wednesday, in which he said the group renounced terrorism and accepted ''the right of all parties'' in the Middle East ''to exist in peace and security,'' was cited by the United States in its decision to open direct talks with the P.L.O. **********The first resolution approved by the Assembly today called for an international peace conference to ''achieve a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' with the P.L.O. taking part along with other parties to the dispute and the five permanent members of the Security Council. **********This means that the Soviet Union and China would both be involved in the Middle East peace process along with the United States, Britain and France. Call for Israeli Withdrawal **********The resolution calls on Israel to withdraw from the territories occupied since the 1967 war and from Jerusalem. It also demands the dismantling of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. **********But the resolution merely ''notes the expressed desire and endeavors'' of the P.L.O. and its Arab allies to place the occupied territories under ''U.N. supervision for a limited period as part of the process.'' **********The resolution was approved with 138 votes in favor, the United States and Israel opposed, and Canada and Costa Rica abstaining. Joseph C. Petrone, head of the United States mission to the Geneva office of the United Nations, called it ''unhelpful and inconsistent with the search for peace.'' **********While accepting some role for an international conference in resolving the Middle East conflict, the United States has always insisted that direct negotiations between Israel, the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors are essential to progress. **********In his address to the General Assembly, Mr. Arafat called for the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces into the occupied territories to ''protect the people'' and oversee an Israeli withdrawal. Measure of Recognition **********The second resolution approved today sought to win a measure of United Nations recognition for the Palestinian state proclaimed by the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O.'s legislative body, at a meeting in Algiers last month. It tried to do this by changing the name of the P.L.O.'s observer mission at the United Nations to the Palestine Observer Mission. **********Western nations contended that the Palestinian state proclaimed in Algiers lacks the normal attributes of statehood, like a functioning government in control of territory and population. The United Nations would thus be setting a dangerous precedent, they argued, if it treated the P.L.O.'s observer mission as the representative of a government rather than an organization. **********The resolution was approved, however, with the third world using its majority in the Assembly to obtain 104 favorable votes. But 44 nations abstained, including the whole of the Western bloc except the United States and Israel, which voted against. **********Mr. Petrone said the Reagan Administration objected strongly to the resolution. Confrontation Resisted **********Some Arab nations also opposed the resolution, arguing that it introduced an element of confrontation into the Arab world's relationship with the West at a time when the P.L.O. was gaining sympathy. **********The Assembly's decision to come to Geneva for Mr. Arafat's speech represents the first time that it has ever voted to leave New York in protest over its treatment by the United States. **********The three-day debate on Palestine is estimated to have cost the United Nations $470,000 in extra expenses. The United States will be billed for one-quarter of the additional expense. **********The General Assembly resumes its 43d annual session in New York on Monday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/01/business/company-news-security-pacific-to-buy-hibernia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Security Pacific To Buy Hibernia", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Security Pacific To Buy Hibernia", "body_text": " **********The Security Pacific Corporation, the nation's seventh-largest bank holding concern, agreed to acquire San Francisco-based Hibernia Bank for $160 million, or about one and a half times its book value.

Most of Time's publications are aimed at broad audiences and carry a wide variety of advertising. By contrast, Whittle's publications are aimed at specific readerships and often use a single advertiser. **********Its most widely publicized new venture is Special Reports, a group of six magazines produced for doctors' offices and supported by advertisers who want to reach people in waiting rooms. 'It's a Good Move' **********''They are a couple of strange bedfellows,'' Michael Drexler, executive vice president at Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, said of Time and Whittle. ''It's a good move because it extends Time's business into the more nontraditional advertising areas, such as out-of-home advertising.'' **********''Now Time can pick up the promotional budgets that don't usually go to magazine advertising,'' Mr. Drexler said. ''For a guy like Whittle, it gives him more financial power and adds credibility to his operations.'' **********Whittle Communications, which was co-founded by Chris Whittle in 1970, at one time owned Esquire magazine. After Mr. Whittle and his partner, Philip Moffitt, sold Esquire, the company began to turn its attention into creating specialized media targeted for audiences, such as medical patients and students. More than two-thirds of Whittle's media properties are sponsored by single advertisers or groups of noncompeting advertisers. **********''Contract publishing is a fast-growing area of the publishing business, because it gives advertisers the chance to reach more selective markets and to identify with a unique editorial environment created for their markets,'' Mr. Drexler said. **********Time said it was acquiring a half-interest with an option to acquire as much as 80 percent of the company over the next five years. The deal is expected to be completed in about a month. **********The purchase does have some risks. Time is investing in a business that is heavily dependent on new ideas. In a recent interview, Mr. Whittle said the Special Projects package for doctors' offices, was already making a profit. ''We had better, because by limiting our advertising, we just can't grow,'' he said. ''The only way is by adding more properties to the 18 we already own.'' **********Whittle is heavily dependent on its management team, led by Mr. Whittle, to come up with those ideas. While he said he would remain active in the company, he does hope to become involved in Tennessee politics. Income Projection **********The two companies said yesterday that Whittle, which would continue to manage its own operations, was expected to have 1989 operating income of $35 million on revenues of $185 million. That would mean Time is paying roughly 11 times 1989 cash flow, which industry analysts said is a standard multiple for such a company. **********The move puts Time into some fast-growing segments. **********For example, the initial six-issue package of the Special Project, which comes out quarterly, is already in 16,500 doctors' offices and $80 million in advertising has been sold to 12 major advertisers. The agreement between Whittle and the doctors who are receiving the magazines at no cost, stipulates that they cannot have more than two other non-package magazines in their waiting rooms. The move was clearly an attempt to compete directly with magazines like Time. **********But at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Whittle said the company would not change its policy. **********Whittle Communications also produces Pursuits, a magazine for Merrill Lynch customers that is financed by Merrill Lynch & Company, and Funnies, a wall poster for laundromats. It also owns the Best of Business Quarterly, a magazine sponsored by the Xerox Croporation that reprints business articles published elsewhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/09/business/daewoo-awaits-aid-move-by-seoul.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1988-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Daewoo Awaits Aid Move by Seoul", "print_headline": "Daewoo Awaits Aid Move by Seoul", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Daewoo Group, this nation's fourth-largest conglomerate, said today that he had received no formal answer to his request for a $730 million Government investment to help save his troubled shipbuilding subsidiary. **********The financial problems of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery are presenting the new Government with a tough choice: stick to a new policy of reducing governmental involvement in business or risk the devastating economic consequences if the company went under. **********The Government has indicated that it is working on an aid package and most analysts here agree, and Government officials themselves concede, that the risk of not acting would be too great - losing the main industry on the small island where the company is based, putting 14,000 people out of work, and jolting public and private banks that have lent money to the subsidiary and its parent. Rapid Diversification **********In a sense, the troubles at Daewoo Shipbuilding encapsulate some of the risks and rewards of South Korea's path to economic growth. Many large conglomerates like Daewoo, with Government prodding and support, diversified rapidly into a variety of businesses. **********They grew large and powerful quickly - Daewoo, founded 20 years ago, now accounts for about 10 percent of the nation's exports. But many took on businesses such as shipbuilding and chemicals that proved unprofitable, and too many big conglomerates went into the same areas. **********Kim Woo Choong, the founder and chairman of the Daewoo Group, which had $6.8 billion in sales last year, said in an interview that the financially pressed shipbuilding subsidiary faced a bleak future unless the Government stepped in. Denial on Bankruptcy **********''Today we're O.K., but if we go a further five years, we have a problem,'' he added. He denied that Daewoo Shipbuilding was teetering on bankruptcy or that its demise would cripple the entire group, saying that a sale of the subsidiary's assets and inventory would raise enough to pay off the debts. **********Hurt by a worldwide shipbuilding recession, the appreciation of the Korean won against the dollar and protracted strikes that resulted in wage rises of nearly 40 percent in two years, Daewoo Shipbuilding last year lost 69 billion won, or about $100 million at current exchange rates, on sales of 514 billion won, or $750 million. Prospects for this year are no better: the company projects that sales will drop more than 10 percent. **********Daewoo Shipbuilding has $2 billion of outstanding debt, with interest payments totaling more than $400,000 a day. Daewoo bought the ailing shipbuilding company in 1978 at the request of the Government, which still owns a 33 percent stake through the state-owned Korea Development Bank. **********The Government once owned 49 percent of Daewoo Shipbuilding, but it cut down its share over the last year in line with its efforts to pull back from the direct aid to business that helped mold what is so often called the Korean miracle. Earlier Deal Cited **********Mr. Kim said that the Government had reneged on an earlier deal that both Daewoo and the Korea Development Bank would invest an additional $438 million in the company. Daewoo put up its share, but the Government only invested $146 million. **********Mr. Kim is proposing that the Government first invest the remaining $292 million to bring its stake back up to 49 percent. Then both Daewoo and the Government would put up another $438 million each, to allow the company to move away from shipbuilding as a primary business. **********Under Mr. Kim's restructuring plan, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery would include a new division to manufacture small cars and trucks under license from Japan's Suzuki Motors, and a new aerospace division. Combined with a Government pledge of $292 million a year worth of orders over the next several years, Mr. Kim predicted that a new company relying on shipbuilding for only 40 percent of its revenues could be profitable in three to five years. Proposal Called Unrealistic **********In the last few years, the Government has been trying to distance itself from the huge conglomerates it helped to create through favorable tax treatment and virtually interest-free loans. A Government official suggested that Daewoo might have to pay a higher price for governmental help now, such as selling off some of its more profitable subsidiaries, but Mr. Kim dismissed the proposal as unrealistic. **********The troubles with its shipbuilding subsidiary come at an inopportune time for the Daewoo Group, which Mr. Kim founded 20 years ago. Hurt by the slump in construction afflicting all large Korean conglomerates, a series of protracted strikes and subsequent wage increases, appreciation of the won and losses from shipbuilding, the group's net income fell 7.4 percent in won terms. Last year, the company had a profit of $29.8 million on its $6.8 billion in sales. **********The car sales of Hyundai Motors are about triple those of Daewoo Motors, a 50-50 joint venture with the General Motors Corporation that had a profit drop last year. Two former members of the group's thriving securities subsidiary, the largest in South Korea, were recently arrested in an insider trading scandal. Difficulties Called Minor **********Mr. Kim brushes aside these difficulties as minor ones, pointing to Daewoo's commanding lead in winning new business with nations such as China and East Germany and the strong showing of its consumer electronics, computer and finance businesses. **********Bankers and securities analysts here praise Mr. Kim's vision and management skills, and no one suggests that the shipbuilding subsidiary's problems reflect on the group as a whole. **********But two securities analysts and a foreign banker all pointed to the same concerns about Daewoo: a shortage of liquidity, the largest percentage of debt of Korea's major conglomerates, and the company's relative newcomer status, which they believe has led Mr. Kim to take more risks -such as expanding by taking over troubled companies like Daewoo Shipbuilding - to catch up more quickly. These considerations, the banker said, lead banks to charge Daewoo the highest rates for loans to the major conglomerates. **********Mr. Kim counters that, for the most part, he has vastly expanded sales and profits at the companies he has acquired. He also points out, and analysts agree, that Daewoo has been extremely successful at raising money in capital markets, both in Korea and in the London-based Euromarkets, and has already put more than $1 billion of new capital into the group this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/business/what-s-new-in-collectible-cars-fueled-by-the-weaker-dollar-classics-go-abroad.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Berger", "pub_date": "1988-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUELED BY THE WEAKER DOLLAR, CLASSICS GO ABROAD", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN COLLECTIBLE CARS; FUELED BY THE WEAKER DOLLAR, CLASSICS GO ABROAD", "body_text": " **********For years, car collectors in the United States used the strong dollar to buy classic European cars at bargain prices.

And at January's Barrett Jackson Auction in Scottsdale, about 20 percent of the bidders were from foreign countries - but they took home more than their share of cars because many bought more than one. **********''Foreign bidders come to these auctions in cartels and buy up bunches of cars for various private collections overseas,'' said Vince Minochi, a classic car restorer and auction veteran. Not surprisingly, the British tend to buy British cars, the Germans buy German - and then there are the Japanese, who ''tend to buy everything,'' according to Mr. Gold of the Classic Car Club. **********Over the last year, encouraged by the combination of a rising yen and a falling dollar, the Japanese have become the most active foreign buyers in the United States collectible car market, according to Mr. Hall of Old Cars Weekly. **********Some enterprising dealers, like Michael Sheehan, president of European Auto Sales in Costa Mesa, Calif., are taking pains to cater to this new clientele. Mr. Sheehan, who said Japanese buyers account for 30 percent of his business, advertises in Japanese publications and has hired a Japanese-speaking salesperson. **********European Auto Sales specializes in restoring and selling Ferraris, which Mr. Sheehan said are ''very hot in Japan right now.'' Japanese buyers are also showing considerable interest in the ''big fin'' American cars of the 1950's and 60's, according to Mr. Brownell of Hemmings Motor News, the leading weekly trade journal. **********Whether they are buying European-built racers or American cruisers, Mr. Sheehan said, Japanese customers won't buy a car unless it is in perfect condition - primarily because there are no restoration facilities in Japan. ''They also care about special qualities,'' Mr. Sheehan continued. ''They'll pay top dollar for a car that raced in Le Mans. They look for cars with a sense of history.'' **********Their historic bent might explain why some Japanese buyers are pursuing certain Japanese cars in this country. For example, a 1967 Toyota 2000 GT may not, on the face of it, seem to be a car worth collecting, but Japanese collectors consider it to be a piece of history. **********The car, which led Japan's entry into the American auto market, can now be sold for $35,000 to Mr. Sheehan, who plans to restore the cars and sell them - for whatever price the market will bear - to Japanese car history buffs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/04/business/company-news-amdahl-s-new-mainframes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amdahl's New Mainframes", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Amdahl's New Mainframes", "body_text": " **********The Amdahl Corporation today introduced a series of mainframe computers that it said are more powerful than any machines currently compatible with I.B.M.'s 3090 series.

Once the funds began to sell, commercial hedgers, speculators and market-making floor traders joined in. Within 30 minutes of the opening, most grain and soybean prices were down for the day. **********''It was incredible,'' said John H. Frazier Jr., executive vice president of the Balfour Maclaine Corporation, in Chicago. ''Not only did the funds unload after the limit opening but also toward the close, when prices they helped knock down were coming back.

''There are plenty of animals out there and they, like humans, will require more calories to support their weight when the temperatures drop,'' he said. **********Sherman L.

What will be available to meet export requirements, such as the 123,000 tons of corn ordered by Mexico today, is anyone's guess.'' **********Because many individual participants in the commodity markets are thinly margined, they cannot withstand a sustained adverse price movement without either liquidating their positions or putting up more cash. **********''Today's market also revealed the psychology of fear that has ruled this market the last few weeks,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Many traders were badly burned during the last two weeks in July, when in the midst of this terrible drought they saw soybean and grain prices plunge as some prudent profit taking turned into a near rout. Those traders who stood fast then saw their huge profits fade away.'' **********During late July, soybeans fell $2 a bushel, or $10,000 for a 5,000-bushel contract. Equally large losses were sustained by corn and wheat traders. **********At the close yesterday, the spot September Chicago wheat delivery was down 2 3/4 cents a bushel, at $3.79 3/4, after reaching a high of $3.96 moments after the opening. Spot corn closed down the limit of 10 cents a bushel, at $2.87 1/4, after opening with a similar maximum advance. **********Spot August soybeans finished with a loss of 7 1/2 cents a bushel, at $8.48 1/2, after a 30-cent limit advance at the opening. Soybean oil lost about a half-cent a pound, but spot soybean meal, an important livestock feed supplement, closed up $1 a ton, at $270.50. **********The price of the drought-ravaged oats crop closed up a further 5 1/2 cents per 32-pound bushel, at $2.80. **********Cattle and hog prices benefited from the decline in soybeans and corn, but with demand for bacon uncommonly weak this summer, the spot August pork bellies delivery, the last before February, closed down 1.55 cents a pound, at 34.175 cents. **********In the New York commodity markets, cotton closed down the limit of 2 cents a pound, with the spot October delivery falling to 53.28 cents a pound. The Agriculture Department report said that the output of cotton, which is the nation's fourth-largest crop, would rise to 14.9 million bales, from 14.76 million last year.

He recalls that several of his competitors in the newsletter business also bought Rolls-Royces at about the same time. ''That's how good business was,'' Mr. Gross said recently. ''We were all making piles of money. **********BOB GROSS, editor of The Professional Investor, an investment newsletter, bought a Rolls-Royce back in 1975. He recalls that several of his competitors in the newsletter business also bought Rolls-Royces at about the same time. ''That's how good business was,'' Mr. Gross said recently. ''We were all making piles of money.'' **********Mr. Gross still drives the Rolls. But after a good long run, subscriptions to his newsletter, which he publishes 24 times a year from his home in Lighthouse Point, Fla., began to dwindle, to about 8,000 now from a peak of 9,600 three years ago. His profits have shrunk considerably - the newsletter has recently been selling for $90 a year, discounted from its list price of $120 - and Mr. Gross has taken to freelance writing to earn extra money. ''The newsletter business isn't anywhere near as good as it was five years ago, and it's gotten much worse during the past year,'' he said. **********Indeed, many of the more than 600 newsletters that sell investment advice have had trouble in recent years recruiting new subscribers and maintaining profit margins, despite the long bull market. **********The publishers of the letters - an eclectic array of individuals like Mr. Gross and established companies such as Value Line and the Standard & Poor's Corporation - have had to cope with a host of problems: rising advertising and mailing costs, the proliferation of investment advice in newspapers and magazines and on television, and the switch by many investors from individual stocks to mutual funds. By all accounts, last fall's market collapse made a bad situation worse. **********Of course, not everyone is suffering. Some newsletters with strong performance records, such as The Zweig Forecast, have posted circulation gains. **********But even many well-established newsletters are feeling the pinch. In 1982, United Business and Investment Reports, a Boston-based letter, had 35,000 subscribers. Although it gained 3,000 subscribers by acquiring Babson Reports last year, the publication, now known as the United & Babson Investment Report, had only 22,000 subscribers as of late February. **********Total circulation of Standard & Poor's Outlook, another major investment letter, declined from 39,000 to 35,000 during the long bull market. ''We've held up reasonably well in relation to many of the other letters,'' said Arnold Kaufman, editor of the Outlook. ''But we've been having a hard time maintaining circulation and profits.'' **********SOME smaller letters have experienced even bigger defections. Max Bowser, editor of The Bowser Report, a newsletter based in Newport News, Va., that recommends low-priced stocks, saw circulation peak at about 10,000 in 1984. Since then, the letter has lost more than half of its readers. **********Investment newsletters hook most of their new customers from a steady stream of trial subscribers, individuals who respond to advertisements that typically run in financial publications and on cable television and offer short-term subscriptions at discount prices or even at no charge. **********But the cost of such advertisements has dramatically increased in recent years, forcing many newsletters to advertise less or not at all. As a result, the pool of trial subscribers has dwindled from 6 million in 1982 to about 1 million, said George Wein, president of the Select Information Exchange, a New York-based marketing service for newsletters. **********Direct-mail costs have also increased, causing some publishers to limit such solicitations. ''The cost of sending out 1,000 pieces of mail has increased manyfold since the early 70's, and it continues to rise,'' Mr. Wein said. **********Even as costs have increased, the response to ads and mailings has slipped. ''You pay much more to get direct mail out, and you get a much lower response,'' Mr. Gross said. ''My last direct-mail test was 2,500 pieces, and I got about 19 or 20 responses. My last ad bombed, too.'' **********Life can be better for newsletters that top the performance rankings in the Hulbert Financial Digest, a Washington-based newsletter that is itself doing quite well. High marks in Hulbert's can translate into substantial benefits at the expense of competitors, although publishers say those benefits may be fleeting. **********''I'm bucking the trend, but I don't know if it's going to last,'' said Martin E. Zweig, whose New York-based Zweig Forecast has been among the top-performing newsletters in recent years. ''When you're hot, a lot of new subscribers come aboard expecting miracles. They end up disappointed, and they don't renew.'' **********Dan Sullivan, editor of The Chartist, a Seal Beach, Calif., newsletter, says that high ratings from the Hulbert service helped increase his letter's circulation from 1,500 in 1982 to about 3,300 recently. But Mr. Sullivan is not sanguine about the industry's prospects. ''In the mid-70's, the response to my mailings was about 2 percent,'' he said. ''Before the crash, it had fallen to 1 percent. Considering that we were in the greatest bull market of the 20th century, I thought people would be more interested.'' **********Newsletter publishers say that increased coverage of financial news by magazines, newspapers and television has reduced the demand for their product by supplying cheaper sources of investment advice. ''The Financial News Network has guys on all day giving free investment advice,'' said Mr. Gross. ''A lot of those guys are the same people who complain that their newsletters' circulations are down.'' **********Newsletters may also have an image problem. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Edwin Fishbaine, publisher of The Terex Report, a newsletter based in New York, failed to disclose to readers that he was paid to write favorably about the securities of several Canadian companies. Mr. Fishbaine maintained that because his newsletter withdrew its registration as an investment adviser earlier this month, the charges were ''moot.'' **********And some newsletter publishers are concerned that the public will associate them with sales people who tout investment products on cable TV. ''We used to have a mystique,'' said Mr. Gross. ''Newsletters were inside stuff and people had no reason to doubt our integrity. Now you get all of these people hustling products on television and the public gets the idea that anyone who recommends investments is sleazy.'' **********THE explosive growth of mutual funds during the bull market has also hurt newsletters that recommend individual securities. ''People who invest in mutual funds don't need newsletters to tell them what stocks to pick,'' Mr. Kaufman said. **********But some publishers rushed in to start a new generation of newsletters focusing on the funds themselves. In 1982, there were only a handful of such letters; now there are about 70, according to Mr. Wein. **********However, investments in stock mutual funds declined steeply in the wake of the market collapse in October, and the mutual fund newsletters have been feeling the impact. **********The market plunge, for example, undermined the efforts of Babson-United Investment Advisors Inc., which publishes the United & Babson Investment Report, to find subscribers for its 19-year-old mutual fund letter, United Mutual Fund Selector. ''There has been a definite dropoff in renewals and new subscriptions,'' said Stanley Rice, a senior vice president at Babson-United. **********And a newer mutual fund newsletter, the Mutual Fund Forecaster, introduced by the Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1985, now has 250,000 subscribers, down from its peak of 260,000 last October. **********DURING the past year, several newsletters have disappeared or merged with others. Among the casualties: Insider Indicator, absorbed last year by the Institute for Econometric Research and merged with The Insiders, a newsletter that tracks insider stock sales and purchases. Even with the merger, The Insiders has only 6,000 subscribers, less than half its 1984 circulation. **********More letters are likely to follow. ''I've seen several guys trying to sell newsletters,'' said Chuck Carlson, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, a Hammond, Ind., investment newsletter with 23,000 subscribers. ''That tells you something.'' **********Some publishers whose newsletters have suffered defections can rely on other sources of income. An investment counseling service accounts for about a third of the revenues at Babson-United, for example. But establishing such a service is easiest if a newsletter itself is a success. Mr. Zweig, for example, has parlayed his letter's performance record into a money management business that oversees private and institutional portfolios worth more than $1 billion. **********To revive flagging newsletters, publishers may need to revise their marketing strategies. That calls for new ideas in a business not known for them. ''These people need to find new ways to get subscribers, but they're not very creative marketers,'' Mr. Wein said. **********In an effort to increase its marketing efficiency, Standard & Poor's Outlook raised the price of its trial subscription several years ago. ''We were looking for higher-quality trial subscribers who were more likely to convert to full subscriptions,'' said Mr. Kaufman. ''We get a lower trial response, but it has proved to be a more efficient way to get regular subscribers.'' **********Newsletter publishers may also have to work harder to develop subscriber loyalty, which translates into higher renewal rates, Mr. Carlson said. Many letters have set up ''hot lines'' that allow subscribers to call toll-free numbers for tape-recorded investment updates. Regular subscribers to Dow Theory Forecasts can telephone or write for answers to investment-related questions. ''The service has helped us to weather the storm more than anything else,'' Mr. Carlson said. **********Firms with substantial direct-mail experience have an advantage over their competitors, according to Mr. Carlson. ''Over time you learn how to get the most for your marketing buck,'' he said. ''You know how to time your mailings and which packages work.'' **********Although some newsletters have disappeared, recent layoffs on Wall Street probably will add to the ranks of newsletter editors and publishers, Mr. Wein said. As for existing letters, many are published by individuals who work at home and have low overhead costs. Most will continue to publish, but few are likely to prosper. **********''You survive,'' said Mr. Gross of The Professional Investor. ''But it's not the fun it used to be.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/09/business/finance-new-issues-a-yield-of-8.55-for-dow-chemical.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Yield of 8.55% For Dow Chemical", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; A Yield of 8.55% For Dow Chemical", "body_text": " **********The Dow Chemical Company is offering $115.6 million of one-year extendible notes with a final maturity in 2015 through underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.

Based on 4,000 interviews, the survey is believed to be the most exhaustive of its kind in Africa. **********The results of 968 interviews showed that after two years of intensive public health campaigns involving pop songs, posters, comic books, television and radio programs, 99 percent of men interviewed knew that AIDS was transmitted by sex and 60 percent knew that condoms block transmission of the deadly virus. **********But asked if they use condoms, 5 percent of 435 married men said yes, and 1 percent of 435 married women said yes. According to the survey, 22 percent of men who said they had extramarital affairs used condoms. The pollsters did not survey condom usage among single people. Condoms 'Not Very Accepted' **********''Condoms are not very accepted in Zaire,'' Bosenge N'Galy, director of the National Committee to Fight Against AIDS, said of the survey results. ''Very few people have moved from knowledge to action.'' **********With heterosexual sex the primary mode of transmission among African adults, the AIDS-causing HIV-1 virus has infected from 6 percent to 8 percent of Kinshasa's adults. **********Preliminary medical surveys indicate that the infection rate may be leveling off in this city of three million.

Local anti-AIDS campaign offices have opened in 9 of Zaire's 11 regions. **********The public opinion survey, which is financed by the United States Agency for International Development, indicated that more than 85 percent of the 968 Kinshasa adults interviewed identified the four principal means of AIDS transmission in Africa - sex with an infected person, injections with infected needles, transfusions with infected blood and transmission from infected mother to baby at birth. **********''Awareness of AIDS is now almost universal in Kinshasa,'' said Jane Bertrand, an associate professor of public health at Tulane University, who directed the study. **********But 53 percent of the men interviewed and 63 percent of the women said that they were at no risk of getting AIDS. 'We Only See White People Dying' **********''People still ask, 'Does it really exist?' '' Dr. N'Galy said. ''They say: 'We only see white people dying of AIDS.' '' **********African newspaper and television coverage rarely use images of local AIDS victims.

''We had to get him on television to say that nothing can replace prevention.'' Nature of New Treatment **********Nevertheless, the damage had been done. Pollsters found that the number of men believing that AIDS can be cured doubled, reaching 57 percent, and that 43 percent believe that a vaccine now exists for AIDS. **********Dr. Lurhuma's treatment involves injections of a substance that he says has anti-viral properties and that stimulates the immune system. Dr. Lurhuma declined in an interview to reveal the formula for the substance, which he calls MM1. **********In an initial test starting here in mid-1987, Dr. Lurhuma and an Egyptian colleague, Ahmed Shafik, inspected 39 patients suffering from an advanced stage of AIDS, known as Stage 4 under an international classification system. Nineteen patients underwent the treatment, a seven-week series of 20 injections with MM1. **********The remaining patients served as a control group and did not undergo special treatment. **********''Thirteen months later, the entire control group was dead,'' Dr. Lurhuma said. ''Eight of the 19 are alive.'' Some Skepticism Voiced **********European and American scientists have greeted Dr. Lurhuma's findings with caution, noting that he has failed to disclose what substance he is using and that his methodology and results are yet to be scrutinized by outsiders.

Col. Javier Carrion told reporters who were brought to the border area that ''it was considered prudent'' in light of statements by the Reagan Administration. **********Officials in Washington this week asserted that Nicaraguan troops had crossed into Honduran territory, and as a result, more than 3,000 American troops were being airlifted to Honduras. Nicaraguan officials, including President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, said the alarm in Washington was aimed at portraying Nicaragua as an aggressor at a moment when President Reagan is appealing for new aid for the contras. Planes From Honduras **********Colonel Carrion also said that at mid-morning, planes had entered Nicaraguan air space from Honduras and had flown low over the area retaken from the contras, apparently seeking to intimidate Sandinista defenders. Minutes later, a distant buzzing was heard that quickly became louder. **********Suddenly an airplane approached from the Honduran side of the Coco River, which forms the border between the two countries. It dropped at least two bombs near the Honduran side of the river, 100 yards from a cluster of journalists. The explosions sent clouds of dust and vapor into the air, shaking the ground as correspondents and soldiers dove for cover. **********The planes could not be positively identified, but the only military jets in the region are based in Honduras. **********No antiaircraft weapons were fired, and Colonel Carrion said he was under orders to avoid ''provocations'' that might give Honduras or the United States a reason to strike directly against Nicaragua. But he said Sandinista defenders would respond to any sustained aerial bombardment. **********''We are taking preventive measures to defend ourselves against American or Honduran air attacks,'' he said. **********Colonel Carrion said contras had been living near the confluence of the Coco and Bocay Rivers for 10 months. He said the campaign to expel contras from this area lasted two weeks and achieved its major objectives, although he said contra camps still exist at other points along the river. **********''We have retaken a portion of our territory that was occupied by mercenaries,'' Colonel Carrion said. **********Most contras who were driven out of this area by the Sandinista offensive apparently fled to nearby bases across the river in Honduran territory. Sandinistas are expecting continued conflict here as contras, now cut off from the American funds that have sustained them, make their way back toward Honduran sanctuaries. **********Colonel Carrion said that about 4,500 troops had taken part in the operation, including air crews that dropped bombs weighing as much as 2,200 pounds. He said units operated under ''strict instructions to avoid crossing into Honduran territory,'' but said that in parts of the rugged border area, ''you can't orient yourself.'' **********The town here disappeared years ago as this became a war zone, and there is no sign that civilians once lived here. The nearest population center, the mining town of Bonanza, is 10 days away on foot. ''There is nothing here except tigers and monkeys,'' Commander Carrion said. **********The area seemed perfectly tranquil this afternoon, with only the songs of tropical birds and the gentle rustle of warm breezes to break the silence. After Colonel Carrion's briefing was completed, groups of reporters walked to the riverside to gaze across into Honduras.

The pair are the subject of the lead article on the giant luxury goods conglomerate. **********''We are aiming at the top echelon of corporate management in France,'' said Fortune's American publisher, James B. Hayes, about Time Inc.'s newest publication. ''None of the other publications in France are servicing that market. The magazine deals both with French business and with global issues as they affect the French marketplace.'' **********The new Fortune, which hit French newsstands on Feb. 4, is a joint venture of Time Inc. and Hachette Filipacchi, the giant French publishing house. The deal is a 50-50 joint venture, with Hachette the managing partner. **********Mr. Hayes was pleased to report yesterday that the 30,000 copies distributed in Paris had already sold out at 25 francs, or $4.50, each. Fortune has no results yet beyond the Paris market. The first issue carried 64 pages of advertising and the rate base was 50,000. **********The magazine's debut marks the first time that any of the three leading American business publications - Fortune, Forbes and Business Week - has tried to sell a foreign language edition in Europe. **********Through joint ventures, Time, which has been trying hard to control costs, has attempted to circumvent the high cost of starting or buying magazines. In the last three years, it has formed a venture with Dale Lang to run McCall's and Working Woman and with Robin Wolender to run Parenting. **********Fortune France is, in part, an attempt to apply that same strategy overseas. And the French language monthly is the first of what Time's management hopes will be a large number of such publications. Mr. Hayes said the company was talking with publishers in West Germany, Italy and Spain and was expecting proposals on joint ventures from Hong Kong and Taiwan. ''We are talking about a nice tidy business,'' he said. **********Time Inc.'s management believes the move makes sense both financially and managerially. Start-up costs are relatively low. Christopher Meigher, executive vice president and group publisher at Time Inc., is betting that the magazine will be profitable by 1990, though he would not forecast revenues and profits. **********Fortune France's publisher, Jean-Gabriel Lambert, is not worried that the magazine will cannibalize International Fortune in the battle for advertising pages. ''Companies such as Rhone-Poulenc have budgets for domestic advertising and for international advertising,'' he said. ''Fortune France would be part of the domestic budget and space in International Fortune would be bought through the international budget.'' A color page costs $9,478 in Fortune France, compared with $43,380 in the American publication. **********Fortune France has its own editorial staff, and each month it can take several articles from Fortune and rewrite the pieces with a slightly French twist, Mr. Hayes said. For instance, the first issue of Fortune France carries a Fortune article on the Vatican's finances that was de-Americanized and embellished with local style and a sidebar on a French diocese. **********Fortune and its American rivals are coming off strong years. Mr. Hayes said that Fortune, which had forecast a drop in ad pages, found that they rose 3.8 percent, to 3,017 pages, in 1987. At Forbes, ad pages were up 6.1 percent, to 3,626 pages. Business Week showed the greatest leap of all: Pages rose 21 percent, to 4,708. According to Publishers Information Bureau data, Business Week carried more advertising pages than any other publication. **********Despite that success, neither Forbes nor Business Week plans to get into the foreign language publications area as aggressively as Fortune. Forbes's publisher, James J. Dunn, said: ''Forbes is not considering anything comparable. Of our total circulation of 735,000 copies, only 5,000 are sold overseas. We don't feel it is a good marketing ploy for us.'' **********Business Week sells 857,000 copies in North America and another 96,000 copies of Business Week International. Its publisher, Jack Patten, said the magazine publishes a Chinese language magazine with a circulation of 25,000, called International Business and Management, which consists of articles from Business Week. ''We supply the editorial and the Chinese Government publishes it,'' he said. For now Business Week has no plans for any other foreign-language editions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-information-resources-shopping-cart-with-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 282, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Information Resources' Shopping Cart With TV", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Information Resources' Shopping Cart With TV", "body_text": " **********Information Resources of Chicago, the nation's third-largest marketing research company, is making an interesting diversification move: into TV-equipped supermarket carts.

Lebanese residents in the vicinity also sought safer ground as rockets fell outside the district. **********The magnitude of the violence reflected deep-rooted hostility between Arafat loyalists and opponents despite renewed efforts to close P.L.O. ranks.

The economic record of the next Administration will depend in no small part on the manner in which the President addresses the moral nature of these questions. **********Economic realities - not Presidential stump rhetoric - will focus our attention on these moral issues. Four underlying economic trends make a moral reorientation imperative: the growing and possibly irreversible environmental crisis; the end of the uncontested world primacy of the United States as an economic and political power; the demise of the traditional ''mom and dad'' family as a system of domestic production and redistribution, and the widening gulf between haves and have-nots along with the reversal of the halting progress toward racial equality made during the 1960's and early 70's. All four trends predate the Reagan years, but all have accelerated during his tenure in office. **********A number of shibboleths of the conventional economic wisdom and Presidential discourses will be casualties of any realistic approach to these trends. Among the casualties are the infatuation with economic growth, the near-exclusive reliance on the profit motive and the pursuit of economic self-interest as guiding principles for resources allocation, the prejudice against a larger public sector of the economy, and the vain quest to restore to America the No. 1 status in the world arena. The Environment **********Long after the closing of the Western frontier, the conception of infinite expansion in a world without natural limits continues to shape our conception of the good life - a better future is a bigger one. America's economic manifest destiny would be to grow at an annual rate of 3 percent: our gross national product per capita doubling every generation. **********But the promised annual outpouring of ever more goods is gobbling up an increasingly endangered natural environment. The culprit is not our desire to better our lives, nor is it growth per se. The growth of productivity - output per hour of labor or per unit of resources used - is a reasonable objective, but it should not be confused with increasing output of goods. The main benefit of productivity increases might well be to expand our free time rather than to continue the outpouring of goods. Or, productivity growth might mean implementing resource-saving technologies. Moreover, not all outputs are equally resource-using: the expansion of basic human services has relatively benign ecological effects by comparison with the production of energy-intensive manufactured goods. **********The next President will have no choice but to rethink the growth ethic and to ask: ''Growth of what, for what?'' Essentials of a new economic morality would include the following: **********First, our well being is based primarily on our security, health, dignity and freedom; goods are a means to these ends, not the other way around. **********Second, meeting the pressing material needs of the less well off, here and throughout the world, will require real income redistribution. **********This is contrary to the ecologically unsustainable premise that simply by increasing the outpouring of goods ''a rising tide will float all boats.'' **********Third, there must also be a recognition that the facile laissez faire assurance that what makes profits for one makes sense for all is a prescription for eco-catastrophe. America's Century **********We never called it an empire, but that's what America was when I was growing up. ''We'' were No. 1; the rest of the world was weaker, poorer, smaller and out-of-date. Where necessary, we strong-armed other countries for what we wanted, whether it was Middle Eastern oil or global markets. American power underwrote the American standard of living. The fact that they needed us more than we needed them was celebrated in public programs from the Marshall Plan to the Peace Corps. **********All this now has the nostalgic feel of a 1950's movie. Nobody doubts that it is over, at least for now. But the idea of empire dies hard and its legacy continues to inform our responses. Two effects are particularly damaging: the pursuit by Democrats and Republicans alike of the vain project of restoring America's primacy. Advocates of ''preparedness'' prefer the military route to reclaiming the No. 1 status. Those favoring the economic route focus on ''competitiveness.'' **********Dominance, rather than the more modest and distinct objective of national security, is the vision that still animates the military strategy. But in a heavily armed and irreversibly ''polycentric'' world, dominance is not possible; nor would it guarantee security were it feasible. **********Advocates of the economic route back to No. 1 correctly point to the unsustainable economic costs of the military strategy. But in their near exclusive concern with competitiveness, they mistake keeping ahead of the ''Joneses'' with economic well being. **********And, like the strategists of military dominance, they fail to address the real challenges of today's global economy: how to coordinate the macro-economic policies of the leading economies and how to foster the growth of living standards throughout the world. Both are essential to maintaining the stable growth of worldwide markets, to reversing the trend toward north-south polarization, and to lessening global tensions and national rivalries. **********Neither challenge will be addressed as long as we adopt a zero sum approach to the global economy, in the mistaken belief that the best way to defend jobs in Detroit is to hold back their creation in Guadalajara. But we are unlikely to reject the zero sum illusion as long as ''preparedness'' and ''competitiveness'' frame our objectives in the world. The Family Economy **********Unlike empire, which haunts our political conscience but rarely in political language, ''the family'' (always in the singular) is what ''we'' are said to be all about. No candidate for anything can afford to disagree, and nobody has the courage to ask out loud ''which family?'' **********The canonical family - husband breadwinner, wife homemaker - was once the standard. But today, only one in five adults lives in ways that fit this description. And this fraction is rapidly declining, having fallen by a third between 1980 and 1985. **********The economic stakes involved are staggering. Even today, more income is distributed between men and women within the family than by the welfare state. The unpaid domestic labor of child-rearing and housework exceeds by a considerable amount the labor employed in the entire goods- producing sector of the economy. Domestic production and distribution is our ''infra-economy.'' Coping with the fundamental shift in its economic structure will require a no less sweeping change of values. Raising Children **********The means by which women and children gain access to material necessities is thus undergoing a profound shift. Women still prepare food, care for the sick, raise children, comfort the old and educate the young as their major work, but much of this work is now done outside the home, for wages. And men find it far easier than in the past to find someone to share their bed without sharing their paycheck. Many men choose to remain single, and others opt out of child support responsibilities following marital separation. **********The standard of living of women (and their children) is no longer simply transacted over the kitchen table. It is now as likely to be hammered out at the bargaining table in labor markets, legislatures and courts. Two-earner families are less likely to be hard up for money; but they are no less likely to be hard pressed for time to take care of the children and each other. **********We are still a long way from the kind of general moral and political discussion about how the things that the canonical family used to do will be done. And we are equally far from deciding who will pay now that the canonical family is headed the way of the horse and buggy. **********Much of what was once done by unpaid domestic labor will simply not get done unless it is now paid for. But it is doubtful that the profit motive and the market can provide the organizing principle for anything but a handful of the necessary tasks. There are good economic reasons why societies of all ideological hues largely eschew the profit motive when it comes to providing for love, child-care and education. **********The implication is clear enough: Dealing with the crisis of the family economy will require a far larger not-for-profit and government sector and a considerably higher tax rate (characteristics, I might add, of virtually all other advanced industrial economies, many of which have outperformed the United States over the past three decades.) With shouldering the responsibility, our choice is either bringing back the horse and buggy, or wringing our hands about women and children in poverty. A Divided Nation **********The joint appearance of fleets of stretch limousines and hundreds of thousands of homeless in the streets of our major cities in the 1980's is an indictment of a failed economic program - a program that promised to stimulate productive investment (not luxury consumption) and well-paying jobs. The widening income gap between the rich and the rest - amply documented by recent census studies - is paralleled by a disturbing rise in racial tensions and an also well-documented reversal of black gains in access to jobs and education. **********What economists Barry Bluestone and Bennet Harrison call the ''U-turn'' back toward greater inequality, is also an ugly omen. It bespeaks a society that has given the pursuit of economic self-interest free reign and is now paying the price of personal alienation, wasted lives, and the erosion of social solidarity. The price is not only a figure of speech; it is a dollars and cents tab that we pay in increasing costs of crime, drug use and the protection of personal security and property. **********Private self-interest run amok shows up also in less obvious but no less damaging ways: in a trendy amoralism in public service and business and a cynical withdrawal from even the most rudimentary public involvements, like voting or union membership. The result is atrophy and cynicism in just those public institutions - labor unions and community governance, for example - that might be the antidote to the trend toward a divided nation and a garrison society. **********Like the closing of the environmental frontier, the end of empire, and the demise of the canonical family, the problem of a divided America might be addressed with Presidential leadership. But it can only be truly addressed by a President who has the courage to put the real moral issues on the table and to set aside the phony morality of the growth ethic, ''American greatness,'' ''the family,'' and the unmitigated pursuit of economic self-interest. If the next President did this, he might find that the American people are more than ready to pick up some old threads of democratic culture - living in harmony with our land, with our brothers and sisters, and even with those whom we do not call ''us.'' Then, more Americans might vote the next time around."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/17/business/court-bars-pillsbury-s-grand-met-defense.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1988-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Bars Pillsbury's Grand Met Defense", "print_headline": "Court Bars Pillsbury's Grand Met Defense", "body_text": " **********A Delaware judge today struck down two major elements of the Pillsbury Company's anti-takeover defense and ordered the company's board to permit shareholders to consider a $5.4 billion offer from Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain. **********Judge William Duffy of the Delaware Chancery Court ordered Pillsbury to drop its ''poison pill'' defense, saying the provision ''was not reasonable in relationship to any threat posed.''

'A Coming of Age' **********MAP and TOP are still not fully developed, even though they are described in detail in two documents, each of which is more than 2,000 typed pages long. But the MAP/TOP Users Groups says that Enterprise 88, as the convention was called, showed that the standards are now detailed and stable enough to become a platform for a new era of rapid expansion in automation. **********''This is a coming of age,'' said John A. Young, chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company, in an address to 120 executives. ''Adulthood is demonstrated this week by producing a real product.'' **********The systems in the mini-factory ran the gamut from electronic order entry to computer-controlled final assembly. Visitors could order the plastic card holder by running a bar-coded convention badge through a code reader at the first booth. They could then order changes in the shape of the four-piece puzzle at the third booth. In succeeding booths, they followed the paperless path of the information and materials that went into the souvenir before it came off a General Motors-managed assembly line six booths later. **********The eight major exhibits were linked to both a local MAP and TOP cable network erected in the convention hall and into existing international communications lines capable of carrying orders to remote sites, like a British Aerospace P.L.C. production plant. Some of the souvenirs were made of stainless steel there and flown to Baltimore on the Concorde. **********In addition to pointing out each of the steps in managing design and production of the souvenir, the booths ran equipment from various vendors that showed how the same tasks could be performed on more serious items, like airplane landing gear. **********The goal was to show that computer-integrated manufacturing, or CIM as it is known, could be based on MAP/TOP standards rather than the specially engineered data networks of individual suppliers like the International Business Machines Corporation or the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********In recent years, such proprietary networks have helped companies become more efficient and competitive. However, advocates of MAP/TOP say such proprietary systems are harder to maintain and improve than a standardized system would be because, in every case, only a limited number of companies make equipment that is compatible with them. A Major Drag **********That limitation has become a major drag on automation efforts and is steadily worsening, according to MAP/TOP backers. For example, companies that have equipment capable of quickly designing new products and shifting production rarely take full advantage of it because it is too difficult to transfer the crucial data among designers, manufacturers, sales personnel and accountants. **********''The only way to really justify the flexibility of today's machinery is to have networks that can use it,'' said Thomas L. Nolle, a Haddonfield, N.J., consultant. ''As time goes by, the standardization of networks is going to be as important to industry as the standardization of measures such as weight and volume.'' **********Many visitors and even some sponsors of the show questioned the claims that the global enterprise created here demonstrated that MAP and TOP have matured as communication standards. Less than 1 percent of factories in the United States use MAP and even fewer offices use TOP. By traditional accounting methods that do not value such speculative advantages as flexibility in adding future equipment, it is still more expensive to set up companywide MAP and TOP networks than those developed by individual vendors like I.B.M. and Digital. Few Software Packages **********Although the price gap is rapidly closing, only a limited number of software packages to manage MAP and TOP network tasks have been written to date. And visitors noted that many of the products used in the mini-factory would not be available until the end of the year at the earliest. **********''There are not enough applications for me to recommend MAP to my boss,'' said an engineering executive of a leading aerospace company, who asked not to be named. ''Also, to be honest, I'm not sure I understand the whole thing yet.'' **********The confusion is understandable. Many industrial users are unprepared for the organizational changes that computer-integrated operations involve. Truly unrestrained flow of information throughout all parts of an organization and to customers and suppliers, which the MAP/TOP standards are intended to encourage, would cut across traditional barriers of rank, function and geography. Automating Cooperation **********It adds up, in Mr. Young's words, to the ''automation of cooperation.'' Corporations could become much more responsive and competitive, but they will also have to wrestle with thorny questions of who should receive information, questions that never arose before because sharing the information was too difficult. **********If so, it will come none too soon for the General Motors Corporation and the Boeing Company, which initiated the MAP standards drive 10 years ago and have shepherded it through a troubled adolescence. G.M. began beating the drums for standards in manufacturing equipment when it became fed up with the inability of its computers and other automation equipment to share information without expensive and inflexible links between them known as interfaces. **********Boeing, one of G.M.'s earliest allies, took the lead in expressing the same concerns on behalf of users of computers for engineering and office work, and created TOP. **********In 1984, G.M. announced the establishment of a MAP users group, which soon linked up with Boeing's TOP group. Today it has 1,500 members from North America, Europe, Japan and Australia. Chinese and Brazilian members are expected to join shortly. A Classic Stalemate **********Few of those members, however, have followed the lead of General Motors and Boeing in investing in installations built to MAP and TOP standards. **********Two major problems slowed product development. First, it has long been apparent that the version of MAP/TOP introduced at Enterprise, known as MAP/TOP 3.0, would depart sharply from earlier versions in certain key areas. Many suppliers were reluctant to invest in new products until the specifications for MAP/ TOP 3.0 were settled, while many prospective users had no interest in MAP/TOP products built to earlier specifications that would soon represent yesterday's leading edge. **********The second problem was that leading computer suppliers like I.B.M. and Digital have been ambivalent supporters of the open systems movement. They said they wanted to serve the MAP market and participated in standards development work, but both companies concentrated greater efforts on expanding the capability of their own proprietary systems so that customers would have less to gain from mixing equipment from different vendors. **********''The attitude was, we can do MAP if you really want it - not here's MAP, come and get it,'' said Michael Kaminski, head of MAP/TOP activities at General Motors. **********G.M. and the other sponsors have banked on the Enterprise show to break such logjams. The debut here of MAP/TOP 3.0, served both to acquaint users and vendors with the new standards and to iron out any ambiguities. To increase interest, the MAP/TOP users group voted last fall to stabilize the potential market by freezing the new standards for six years.  From Robots to Mainframes, Speaking the Same Language  Companies are seeking standards that would allow computers and manufacturing equipment to communicate, simplifying automation. At a recent convention, they demonstrated two standards known as MAP and TOP by showing how they could link different tasks in manufacturing a souvenir. Each box represents a booth at the convention; the lines represent the communication links between them.  Office Systems: Boeing  The souvenir was ordered here.  MAP/TOP products from 14 companies were connected.  Design and Materials Planning: TRW  MAP/TOP products from eight companies analyzed changing production requirements as customer demand fluctuated.  Advanced Design Systems: Air Force-Industry Coalition  Details of the souvenir's design could be changed here, automatically triggering changes in manufacturing operations elsewhere. Twelve companies participated.  Manufacturing: Deere  Preparation of souvenir parts was simulated and included the use of subcontractors.  Remote Production: Communications Network for Manufacturing Applications  Stainless steel versions of the souvenir were ordered from a manufacturing plant in Britain, demonstrating remote operations. Thirteen European companies participated.  Subcontractors: British Department of Trade and Industry  Fifteen independent manufacturing operations were linked to the network as subcontractors.  Raw Materials Processing: Process Industries Group  Production of plastic was simulated here, tying a raw materials supplier into the network. Sixteen companies were involved.  Invoices: Corporation for Open Systems  Invoices for the manufacture of the souvenir were generated here.  Final Assembly: General Motors  The souvenir was assembled by robots and delivered to the customer.

Wife vs. Husband **********The fight pits Karla Scherer Fink, the largest shareholder, against her husband, Peter R. Fink, the president and chief executive. At stake is the selection of 3 of Scherer's 11 directors and the question of whether the company, which makes drugs and other pharmaceuticals, should be sold. **********Mrs. Fink, the 51-year-old daughter of the company's founder, proposed the sale in April and shortly afterward filed for divorce from Mr. Fink.

''Frankly, I find it disgusting.'' **********Mrs. Fink controls 33.2 percent of the votes, and her brother, John S. Scherer, who supports her, controls 5 percent. Other investors have pledged about 3.3 percent of the vote, leaving the dissident shareholders needing about 9 percent for a majority. A 'Hostile Environment' **********In a speech to the shareholders, Mrs. Fink said that although no bids for Scherer had been made, potential buyers that she did not name were waiting in the wings. ''But they will not come forward in the hostile environment the board has created,'' she said. **********She has said that she wants to sell the company to diversify her investments, which are tied up in class B shares that would lose most of their voting power if they were sold to outsiders. **********Even without the 9.3 percent block of votes held by the trustee, the dissident shareholders have a good chance of winning this stage of the proxy fight, said Lawrence A. Obstfeld, a pharmaceutical analyst for Commonwealth Associates, a firm in New York. **********''We think that they'll win the proxy fight and establish two more seats on the board of directors, but we do not think they'll find a buyer for the company near the price it's trading at,'' he said. **********Scherer stock closed up $1.375 today, to $26.25, in over-the-counter trading. 2 Posts Being Contested Only two directorships are being contested; the third is occupied by John Scherer, whom both sides have nominated for re-election. **********Theodore Souris, one nominee of the dissident shareholders, appeared to give some ground on whether Scherer should be sold.

Godine inaugurates its New York office this morning, Jessica Benson will not have much worry about being late for work. ''I'll be working from my apartment the first six months to a year,'' said Ms. Benson, the sole employee in Godine's new office. ''After that we may rent space with an existing publisher.'' **********Other out-of-towners have similarly been testing New York's publishing waters recently - some hoping to drum up greater publicity for their books, others in order to make more money from reprint rights, and still others for what they regard as the greater prestige derived from a New York address. Whatever the reasons, most of the newcomers have pronounced their experiments a success. Examples of Newcomers **********In addition to Godine, these others include the following: *********** Addison-Wesley of Reading, Mass., a suburb of Boston. A major educational publisher, the company is determined to become a major publisher of general nonfiction (trade books), and is convinced that to do so requires a strong New York presence. Less than two years ago that New York trade book presence amounted to two employees working in the home of the editorial director, Jane Isay. Today the publisher has eight employees and an office on Fifth Avenue. *********** Contemporary Books of Chicago. Already one of the biggest publishers of general-interest books in the Middle West, Contemporary bought Congdon & Weed, a small New York publisher, last year and is rapidly transforming itself into a New York house for fiction and nonfiction. ''We want to be one of the major players; we're paying major money for acquisitions and the major action is in New York,'' said Harvey Plotnick, president of Contemporary. *********** North Point Press of Berkeley, Calif. This literary house, which had major best sellers with Evan Connell's ''Son of the Morning Star'' and Beryl Markham's ''West With the Night,'' is represented by a director of subsidiary rights who works out of the office of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, which distributes North Point's books. (Subsidiary rights involve selling reprint rights to paperback houses, selling to book clubs and selling excerpts from books to magazines and newspapers.) *********** The new trade book division of Boston-based Little, Brown & Company, which will be headed by Richard Seaver. (Little, Brown already has a strong trade book presence in New York.) *********** Oxmoor House of Birmingham, Ala., which like Little, Brown is a subsidiary of Time Inc. Its New York office, scheduled to open next month, will publish special-interest books for Time, Sports Illustrated, Life and People. The Use of Agents **********Many out-of-town publishers retain New York-based agents to publicize their books, to peddle them to paperback houses and book clubs, or to license them to foreign publishers. **********New York remains the center of trade book publishing - the headquarters of most houses and literary agents, as well as the one city visited by almost every foreign publisher. It is also the home of many authors. ''The last time we counted, 37 percent of our authors were from Manhattan,'' said Jack Shoemaker, editor in chief of California-based North Point. **********The possibility of direct contact with one's authors does play a small part in publishers' decisions to open or retain a New York office. ''We have a lot of authors in the East and our New York office gives them a feeling they have a personal relationship with us,'' said Amanda Mecke of the University of California Press, which has been here since the 1960's. A Sign of Credibility **********For North Point, New York is important for a different reason. ''There are agents, perhaps, and authors, perhaps, who feel that because we have a New York office we are somehow more 'real' - not that they ever utilized the office,'' Mr. Shoemaker said. **********Instead, North Point's New York office concentrates on selling foreign rights, income from which has increased fivefold in a little more than a year. **********For Addison-Wesley, the New York office has been everything the company had hoped. ''It has worked brilliantly,'' said Ms. Isay, formerly with Basic Books and the Yale University Press. ''We have been able to really tie into the network of writers and agents and gossip.'' **********Ms. Benson of Godine, who is starting her first day of work, plans to tout her employer's books to news organizations, but she will probably spend more time selling subsidiary rights. **********''For a small house like Godine, it's a way of recouping the expense of having a presence here,'' she said, ''and income from subsidiary rights increases proportionately according to the amount of time you put into trying to sell them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/20/world/reagan-in-toronto-heady-occasion-for-an-old-hand.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Only Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who had been in office 18 months longer than Mr. Reagan, seemed to be an ally; the rest, in the words of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, reacted to Mr. Reagan ''with skepticism and even derision.'' **********Today, Ronald Reagan returned to Canada, the country where he made his shaky summit debut, to attend his last such conference. This trip may well be his last outside the United States as President. It is the last on the White House schedule, and none are likely to be added, a White House aide said only half-jokingly this morning, unless another meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev is planned or unless Mr. Reagan should win the Nobel Peace Prize. Good Spirits on the Road **********Foreign travel has never delighted Mr. Reagan quite as much as it did Presidents Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy. But the President knows its uses. He seemed in fine spirits as he arrived for the opening session of the conference here, and his aides showed none of the edgy defensiveness they exhibited a year ago at the summit meeting in Venice. **********Much of the leaders' first two hours together were devoted to a review of events since Mr. Reagan came to power, said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and to progress on the economic front in that time. **********''Seven years ago,'' said Charles Z. Wick, the director of the United States Information Agency, who flew to Toronto with the President, ''the allies didn't know quite what to make of this guy - an actor, maybe governor by a fluke, too old to be in the White House. Everyone in the West was worried about the world economy and about the Russians and their SS-20's. Supporter Cites Rebound **********''A year ago, frankly, he was at a real low point, with his credibility hurt by events at home. Now, by force of character, he has re-established himself as the leader of the free world and his values as those that must guide the alliance.'' **********The host for this 14th economic summit meeting, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, bristled recently when a reporter used the expression ''lame duck'' to describe Mr. Reagan, who has only about seven months left in office. **********''Here is a guy who has just come back from the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Mulroney told Maclean's magazine. ''He is as vigorous as you are ever going to see anyone even close to that age. He's leading the most powerful economy in the world and he's the most popular President in the recent history of the United States. Believe me, you're not talking to a lame duck. You're talking to a vigorous, very dynamic guy who is in charge of his business and knows exactly what he wants to do.'' Tempered Appraisals **********Others would offer a more tempered appraisal of Mr. Reagan's standing as his second term approaches its end, notably President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, both of whom prize their independence of thought and action. The Toronto Sun, a right-wing tabloid-sized newspaper, ran a half-page color cartoon this morning of the President asleep in his limousine - an allusion, no doubt, to the clear signs of fatigue displayed by Mr. Reagan during his visit to Moscow last month. **********But all of his colleagues are prepared to praise the President's contributions to the alliance during the course of this, his ''sunset summit,'' to use a phrase that has been in vogue at the White House lately. **********The robustness of the United States economy despite last year's stock market crash, the low level of unemployment in the United States and the rapprochement between Washington and Moscow have all earned Mr. Reagan a new respect among Europeans who described him, as recently as the Venice summit a year ago, as a has-been, crippled by the Iran-contra scandal and unlikely to maintain a starring role on either the national or international stages. 'His Luck Held' **********''But his luck held,'' an Italian diplomat reflected this afternoon, ''just when it seemed to all of us that it had surely run out at last.'' **********Even in the midst of the burgeoning Pentagon procurement scandal last week, the President was hammering away at his abiding message, that slashing tax rates, especially for corporations and well-off individuals, and that selling state-owned companies and deregulating industry are the routes to economic salvation, open to all nations. **********''Everywhere in the democratic world we are seeing the emergence of a new consensus that growth and opportunity go hand in hand,'' he told the Atlantic Council in an expansive commentary on his own policies. ''I don't need to tell you that the United States has led the way, or that the remarkable performance of our economy is the driving force behind the new consensus that has brought the economies of America, Britain, Canada and so many countries roaring back.'' Thatcher's Loyalty **********Mrs. Thatcher was the first leader to enlist in Mr. Reagan's band of free-market evangelists, and she remains his most loyal friend in the alliance. **********Many Britons and other Europeans expect her to play the key role in the alliance over the next year or so, moving into the vacuum that will inevitably develop, however temporarily, during the Presidential transition in the United States. She will surely continue to push the Reagan agenda. **********Mr. Mulroney of Canada, who came to power in 1984 just as the President was winning a second term, has seen himself as something of a protege of Mr. Reagan and has staked much of his political future on the trade agreement that the two men helped to negotiate between their two countries. Italian and Japanese Support **********Italy, under a succession of prime ministers culminating in the incumbent, Ciriaco de Mita, has emerged as a key backer of Mr. Reagan's economic and security policies. **********And Japan, especially under former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who left office last October, has followed the President on more issues more of the time than seemed conceivable five or six years ago. **********Whatever his former aides may say in their memoirs, the President is seen by his colleagues not as a passive actor dominated by his aides, not as a beleaguered old man unwilling to move against corrupt associates. Economics and foreign policy are what really count at these annual jamborees, not management styles and ethical standards, which is probably why Mr. Reagan seemed so happy to be among his old friends here in Toronto this week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/18/world/trivandrum-journal-an-education-in-politics-for-girls-at-holy-angels.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1032, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trivandrum Journal; An Education in Politics For Girls at Holy Angels", "print_headline": "Trivandrum Journal; An Education in Politics For Girls at Holy Angels", "body_text": " **********In India's gentle deep south, where mosques and churches share the beach-front coconut groves with Hindu temples, two perenially wary adversaries - a Marxist government and a Roman Catholic education system - are squared off again in tense confrontation. **********The immediate issue is the future of a convent high school for girls run by Carmelite sisters.

On Oct. 5, responding to an outcry from parents and protests from a high-level delegation led by the Rev. Benedict L. Jose, manager of Roman Catholic schools in the Trivandrum diocese, and the school's headmistress, Sister Noella, Mr. Chandrasekharan put the order on accreditation into abeyance. Earlier Dispute Recalled **********In an interview, Mr. Chandrasekharan said he did not want the Catholic educators to feel that he held a sword of Damocles over their heads while the future of the school was being discussed. **********Opposition politicians, regional newspapers and parents of students at the century-old independent school, which regularly tops the state in standardized examination results and which is held in high regard by families of all religions, say there is more to the state government's turnabout than officials admit. **********In 1957, Kerala - more than a fifth of whose population of 25 million is Christian, seven times the national average - became the first state in India to elect a Communist government. That government, led by E. M. S. Namboodiripad, now General Secretary of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, lasted only two of its allotted five years. **********It was dismissed in 1959 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in part, local politicans say, because of its plans to restructure education in the state, at the expense not only of Roman Catholic but also of Hindu and Moslem schools. The public outcry that was heard in New Delhi arose from Liberation Struggle, a movement of offended parties and castes who wanted to end Marxist rule before basic changes could be made in local institutions. School Has Many Supporters **********Few institutions have drawn as much emotional support then or now as the Catholic schools, which played a large part over several centuries in making Kerala India's most literate and in many ways most progressive state. Holy Angels was the first school to send young Kerala women into the best universities and encourage them to take up nontraditional careers. **********Kerala Catholics, including the Syrian churches, which trace their origins on this coast to the first century, and Latin churches, which grew from Portuguese and other Western missionaries in the later age of empires, are divided by rite and caste.

The political opposition would be quick to seize the chance to embarrass, drawing to it religious leaders of varying degrees of zealousness. Fundamentalism Wins Converts **********Communists here and at the national level fear nothing more, they say, than the growth of religious fundamentalism, which is attracting disaffected youths who might have joined Marxist parties. **********Kerala's present government, which came to power in March 1987, is a coalition led by Communists; its Education Minister is a member of the Janata Party, which in Kerala has adopted a generally socialist line. **********Mr. Chandrasekharan insists that the state government has no plan to downgrade religious and other private schools. But other government officials who are Communist Party members acknowledge in informal conversations that they would like to reduce the influence of Catholic schools in local education. **********In an interview, Father Benedict would not be drawn into a political characterization of the threat facing Holy Angels, a high school that also has on its campus a kindergarten, a primary department for boys and girls and a college for women. But parents, including a Hindu father and a Catholic mother interviewed separately, said that in their minds there was no doubt this was a political move to undermine private education. #15 Teachers Dismissed The school's problems began in June when it dismissed 15 teachers, including 5 nuns, who were unqualified by state standards but who had been hired at various times over the last 11 months when no better qualified teachers applied. Seven of those dismissed sought the help of a Marxist trade union and petitoned the government, which ordered them reinstated. **********After the school refused, and obtained a court order staying the government's hand, Holy Angels was told that from the next academic year no more students could be accepted. When the present students had completed their schooling, the institution would close. **********''The government is now saying the school management is seeking reconciliation,'' Father Benedict said. ''This is not true.'' The whole controversy has been ''an affort to tarnish the image of the school,'' he said, adding that there could be no compromise. ''Our task is to get that de-recognition order withdrawn.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/28/business/business-digest-thursday-july-28-1988.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 700, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Digest: Thursday July 28, 1988", "print_headline": "Business Digest: Thursday July 28, 1988", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********Economic growth slowed while inflation heated up during the spring.

''I think that was the other Austria,'' Mr. Wolf said of those who applauded.

It considers the departure of the last occupying Allied soldiers in 1955 as its liberation day. **********Austrian officials, historians and political scientists said in interviews that the international dispute over the wartime record of Kurt Waldheim as a lieutenant in the German Army had greatly enhanced the number and scope of the events. The remembrances will reach a first culmination on the annexation anniversary and a second on Nov. 9, the 50th anniversary of Crystal Night, when Nazi thugs wrecked synagogues and Jewish shops throughout Greater Germany. **********''The world expects it of us,'' Gerold Christian, the President's spokesman, said in an interview. **********While the enduring storm over Mr. Waldheim, the former Secretary General of the United Nations and now President of Austria, has given a higher profile to the Year of Reflection, the President's personal participation in the remembrance is the center of a political dispute. **********The parliamentary leaders of Austria's four parties - the Socialists and Conservatives who form the governing coalition, the right-wing Freedom Party and the left-wing Greens - have been engaged for weeks in acute bickering over Mr. Waldheim's role in a special session on March 11. **********A joint session of both houses had been announced until it was realized that this would put Mr. Waldheim, whose position is largely ceremonial, in a position to make an address.

But he also blamed the world at large for failing ''to stand by a small country that faced the aggression of an overpowering dictatorship.'' **********Many Austrians do not share this view of the 1938 events.

The meeting, he said, was part of an effort to bolster the Central American peace process and generate opposition to the Reagan Administration's policy of aiding anti-Government rebels in Nicaragua. **********A statement on the meeting by Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the chief Vatican spokesman, said the Pope had reaffirmed his support for the peace plan adopted by five Central American presidents in August, ''particularly the right of populations to live in a political regime based on the principles of true democracy.'' **********John Paul, the statement said, ''expressed to President Ortega the hope and need that peace in the region is achieved, underlining the necessity that it is carried out through a faithful dialogue, with respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.'' **********A senior Vatican official who had discussed the meeting with the Pope said, ''Ortega listened more than he talked.'' Relations Have Been Strained **********It was the first time that the Pope had seen Mr. Ortega in almost five years. In that time relations between the Vatican and the Sandinista Government have been marked by tension and occasional hostility over the expulsion of priests from Nicaragua and other actions regarded by the church as restrictions on religious liberties. Vatican officials said the meeting today did not indicate an improvement in those relations but was a sign of the Pope's interest in the peace process. **********Mr. Ortega was afforded all the protocol honors due a head of state on an unofficial visit to the Vatican, but the Pope's public welcome to his guest was unusually cold, according to Vatican officials and reporters who witnessed the exchange. **********John Paul emerged from his private study stern faced and extended his hand to the President, saying ''good day'' in Spanish. The Pope then brusquely turned around and walked back into his study, leaving his guest to follow him in. **********On other occasions, even with government leaders at odds with the Vatican, the Pope has smiled and escorted his guest into the audience. John Paul seemed somewhat more hospitable after the private meeting when Mr. Ortega's entourage came into the study for an exchange of gifts and a picture-taking session. **********''My impression was that the Holy Father received him coldly,'' said a Vatican official who observed the public parts of the audience. ''Then the Pope said all that he wanted to say, and there was more cordiality later.'' **********Asked at a news conference to comment on his reception, Mr. Ortega said, ''If it was cold, that was because it is colder in Rome than in Nicaragua.'' **********The Sandinista leader repeatedly denounced President Reagan's proposal to Congress for $36.25 million in aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. No Vatican Comment on Aid **********Mr. Ortega is on a tour of four European capitals, and Nicaraguan diplomats here said he had been expected to ask the Pope, as he has other leaders, to come out against aid to the contras. But neither Vatican officials nor Mr. Ortega would comment on this point after the audience. **********The Pope has often said the nations of Central America should be left to work out their problems without foreign interference, but this point was not specifically mentioned in the Vatican statement today. Mr. Navarro noted that the statement cites the Pope's hope that the Central American peace plan would be applied ''in each of its parts, without overlooking any single element,'' and that this included a bar on foreign aid to insurgents. **********Notably absent from the Vatican audience was the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, the Rev. Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, who is accompanying Mr. Ortega. Father d'Escoto is one of three Catholic priests who have been suspended from priestly activity because they continued to hold Cabinet posts in the Sandinista Government despite Vatican demands that they step down. **********The expulsions of at least 10 priests and two bishops from Nicaragua as well as the Government's closing of a church radio station seriously strained relations in recent years. Although these measures have been largely reversed in compliance with the peace plan, a senior Vatican official said no basic reconciliation had taken place. **********''The Sandinistas agreed to comply with the peace plan, which is very worthy, but we have to be realistic and so we are waiting to see some facts,'' the official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/13/world/with-an-election-over-bangladesh-looks-to-the-next.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1988-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With an Election Over, Bangladesh Looks to the Next", "print_headline": "With an Election Over, Bangladesh Looks to the Next", "body_text": " **********No sooner did the Government party win an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections earlier this month than talk began about dissolving the body and holding a new vote next fall. **********The election, boycotted by the major opposition parties and by most Bangladeshi voters, appeared to have resolved little in the continuing conflict between President H.

BERRIEN had just returned from an international travel conference in Budapest last Friday, and he was bubbling with praise for an article about the Hungarian capital in the October issue of Gourmet. That seems odd only when you consider that Mr. Berrien is the publisher of a competing magazine, Travel & Leisure. **********If he exudes confidence as he celebrates his first anniversary at the helm of the flagship of the American Express Publishing Corporation, Mr. Berrien, 36 years old, appears to have cause. The November issue of Travel & Leisure, with a circulation of 1.1 million, is the fattest in the magazine's 18-year history, with 181 pages of advertising. For the year, ad pages will break 1,400, also a record and an increase of 15 percent from 1987. What is more, advertising revenues will come in at about $45 million, up from $39 million last year. **********''There comes a time when things need to be re-energized, and that's what we set out to do a year ago,'' Mr. Berrien said, using the first-person plural common to kings, popes and publishers. ''We now have a revitalized, renewed group of people spreading the T & L gospel.'' **********Much of the proselytizing is being done by the magazine's four new regional advertising directors, who replaced a more conventional, hierarchical sales team and have ''complete authority'' over their areas, Mr. Berrien said. **********Their missionary work appears most successful in the Pacific Rim, which Mr. Berrien (who came to Travel & Leisure after three successful years as publisher of its sister publication, Food & Wine) calls ''our biggest growth area.'' The magazine will pull $1.6 million of advertising this year from Hawaii alone, and another $1.5 million from Asia and Australia. Among the new advertisers this quarter are Toyota, Nissan and Honda Acura. **********But if the year has been rosy, Mr. Berrien still betrayed sensitivity to one subject: Conde Nast Traveler. His conversation was sprinkled with references to the year-old travel magazine, including his admission that Travel & Leisure changed its policy on free trips for its writers in response to Traveler's ''no junket'' policy. **********Mr. Berrien also conceded that at least some of his magazine's good fortune is owed to Traveler. **********Thanks to Traveler, Travel-Holiday, European Travel and Life and even Time magazine - which recently started a travel section -''there's been so much attention focused on the travel-magazine market that people are beginning to take notice,'' he said. ''And the leader becomes the smart buy.'' **********Rather than rest on its leadership position, Travel & Leisure has entered the discounting fray by offering advertisers who renew their full ad schedule a 5 percent credit to purchase incremental space. **********The magazine is also making editorial changes to meet vacation trends. Last month, it expanded its eight-year-old monthly ''Travel and Money'' section to four pages from two, in recognition of the impact of the lower dollar on Americans traveling abroad. **********The magazine is also taking note of a trend toward shorter vacations. ''Over the next six months, there will be a real revolution in our six regional editions,'' Mr. Berrien said. ''They will be oriented more toward short trips. That's where a lot of our growth will come from.'' **********Travel & Leisure's successful year and future hopes are being celebrated in a new trade advertising campaign breaking this week. Designed by Ogilvy & Mather, which also handles the American Express Company, the $1 million print campaign focuses on the idea that Travel & Leisure is a publication its readers use. **********In ''real-life'' scenes reminiscent of the current trade campaign for Harper's Bazaar, the magazine appears in a shoulder bag at an English pub and on the dashboard of a car traveling through the Napa Valley. **********''What will give this campaign legs is that the magazine will keep popping up in interesting places,'' Mr. Berrian said.

This would be the fourth era of computing growth, following periods in which mainframe, minicomputer and personal computer companies were the growth leaders. **********The network computing outlook assumes that connected work stations will displace stand-alone mainframes and minicomputers. Users will be able to share data and printers while having the undivided attention of their work station's central processor. By contrast, mainframes and minicomputers generally divide the central processor's time among different tasks or users. **********Mark Stahlman, a computer industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that between 1987 and 1992 more than 60 percent of the industry's growth will come from network computing. Companies like Sun that are focused exclusively on such products will grow at rates as high as 40 percent annually, far ahead of the industry average of 13 percent, he said. **********Mr. Stahlman said there are a limited number of pure plays available to those who believe in the inevitability of a network computer transformation. In addition to Sun, Apple Computer Inc., the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Intel Corporation will benefit from the shift, he said. Cray Research Inc. should also benefit, he added. The company's supercomputers are increasingly being used as high-speed computing platforms tied to networks of work stations. Leading manufacturers of stand-alone computers also have network products and may benefit from the trend as well, he said, but the gains may be watered down by the costs of defending established product lines. The Digital Equipment Corporation, for example, attributed its stronger-than-expected quarterly results, announced two weeks ago, in part to the vigor of its work station sales. Mr. Stahlman also cites I.B.M. and the Unisys Corporation as companies with momentum in established markets that will also have significant growth opportunities in network computing. **********The stock prices of only some of the five pure plays that Mr. Stahlman describes currently reflect network computing growth opportunities. He says that both Sun and Intel are already selling at a premium. Compaq, on the other hand, is still undervalued, and Apple is selling significantly below its historical multiples. **********Mr. Stahlman foresees significant disappointments for investors in minicomputer companies, which he expects to be the biggest victims of the shift to network computing. **********In addition to benefiting from its commitment to network computing, Sun has been helped by its adherence to a philosophy of ''open'' standards that is gaining support among computer users. Under this strategy, computers are built to standards that can be copied by any manufacturer. The designs are not proprietary, as they are at companies like I.B.M., Digital or Apple. **********Analysts say that Sun's decision to champion open standards and its alliance with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company have had a favorable impact on investor perceptions and, at the same time, have raised doubts about the prospects of conventional industry leaders like I.B.M. and Digital. Those doubts have been reflected in downward pressure on I.B.M.'s stock and even greater downward pressure on Digital's, said Marc Schulman, who follows the computer companies for Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Digital and I.B.M. have belatedly thrown their weight behind the open systems trend, joining with the Hewlett-Packard Company, Apollo Computer Inc. and others to form a consortium, the Open Systems Foundation, to advance their own set of open standards. Mr. Schulman thinks that the Open Systems Foundation will ultimately offset the Sun-A.T.& T. coalition and set the dominant standards for the industry. **********Where will all of this leave I.B.M., the industry's ultimate blue-chip stock? The official wisdom at I.B.M. is that work stations will become more important to the company as increasingly complex software requires more computing horsepower to manage sophisticated graphics displays and new features like voice input. But I.B.M. executives insist that sales of mainframe computers, which have slowed in recent years, will again grow significantly, and that the work stations will continue to depend on central mainframes. **********Although Wall Street analysts have applauded I.B.M.'s recent cost-cutting moves to increase profitability, some think that the computer giant is still underestimating the impact of networking. **********''You don't need an I.B.M. mainframe to run a big company anymore,'' said Will Zachmann, a market researcher at the International Data Corporation, in Framingham, Mass. Mr. Zachmann argues that mainstream Wall Street analysts are fooling themselves on I.B.M.'s prospects. **********''It's really funny the way these people will interpret things,'' he said. He added that it was not sensible to think that I.B.M.'s cost-cutting moves were good for the company. I.B.M., he said, ''is getting ready to sacrifice long-term market share to make its numbers in the short term.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/30/business/the-media-business-advertising-leslie-agency-creates-a-talking-car-engine.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leslie Agency Creates A Talking Car Engine", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Leslie Agency Creates A Talking Car Engine", "body_text": " **********As a talking car engine, the actor Dan Region has a lot to say about getting a tune-up, all of it good.

An ambitious and aggressive leader has come to the surface in Serbia, the biggest republic, and the national strivings of the Serbs have emerged with him. Several Recent Protests **********In one province, Vojvodina, party leaders who had tried to rein in pro-Serbian rallies resigned Thursday after tens of thousands of people took to the streets and demanded their ouster. **********And today in Titograd, in the republic of Montenegro, about 10,000 people chanting ''You betrayed the people!'' marched on the republic's Parliament to demand the resignation of local Communist Party leaders. **********Of all the troubles, the material difficulties of Yugoslav daily life are the most apparent. Long Lines for Food **********There are long lines outside food stores, but there is no food shortage -low wages cause the lines. The bread price has risen so many times this year that late in the summer the Government decreed that bakeries must apportion 30 percent of production to a dark bread - ''people's bread'' - at a subsidized price of 8 cents a loaf, about one-fifth that of the next-lowest-priced loaf. Since then, the requirement has been raised to half the output. **********Some newspaper readers now make deals with their newsstands. They return the paper they buy within the hour and get half their money back. Magazine readers arrange with friends to share periodicals. **********Inflation stands at 200 percent for the last 12 months, and Yugoslavia's agreement with the International Monetary Fund, in return for new credits and rescheduling of the $21 billion foreign debt, limits wage increases over the year to 139 percent. As a result, the decline in real wages was put at 20 percent for the year by a Western ambassador. **********In a country where 5,000- and 20,000-dinar notes have only recently come off the printing press, a 50,000-dinar bill has just made its appearance, quickly to be christened ''the one-night beauty.'' The daily foreign-exchange listing in the newspapers is called ''the obituary.'' A dollar is worth 3,428 dinars. **********Brief strikes over wages - illegal but unhindered - are widespread and often settled by pay increases, also illegal but useful in keeping the social peace. Marches by workers on Government buildings, including the Federal Parliament in Belgrade, are common. **********All these developments point to a weakening of state authority - in what was already the most open of one-party Communist states - and the waning hold of the ruling ideology. **********''It is a collapse of our whole development model, economically and politically, since Tito,'' said Janez Stanovnik, President of Slovenia and a Communist in the days before Tito, when Yugoslavs enjoyed a choice of parties. ''The legitimacy of party rule is challenged.'' **********Slovenia is the republic where questions and challenges to authority are most freely raised, but in many interviews in Belgrade, the Federal and Serbian capital, officials voiced such views either expressly or showed that they took them so fully for granted that they need not make them explicit.  A New Serbian Leader With an Old Mission **********Important and intractable as are the economic and political difficulties facing the highly decentralized authorities of Yugoslavia's federal Government and six republics and two autonomous provinces, they have been overshadowed since the summer by the upsurge of a long suppressed issue and a leader who has made it his own. **********He is Slobodan Milosevic, a 47-year-old party functionary who previously served as head of the Belgrade Bank. He triumphed last year in an internecine struggle to emerge as Serbian party chief and the unchallenged strongman of the largest republic. **********Mr. Milosovic proved his power this week. On two successive days he persuaded the workers who had marched on Parliament in Belgrade to return to work, and did so without making any concessions. On the next day, tens of thousands of protesters shouting his name forced the resignation of the entire Communist Party leadership of Vojvodina Province because they opposed bringing it more fully under Serbian control. Opponents say they suspect that Mr. Milosevic had a hand in creating these events but offer no proof to substantiate the charge. **********The issue is the nationalism of Serbs, the most populous Yugoslav nationality. Since July, Serbs have been holding large meetings throughout this republic, meetings instigated by Serbs from Kosovo. They are protesting what they believe to be an Albanian plot to drive the 200,000 Slavs - Serbs and Montenegrins - who live among 1.7 million ethnic Albanians out of the province and either make it an Albanian republic within Yugoslavia or join it with neighboring Albania. **********When ethnic Albanians staged mass protests in 1981, violence erupted and at least nine, and perhaps as many as 50, people were killed. The conflict was officially designated by the harshest word in Communist terminology, ''counterrevolution,'' and Serbians charge that this is continuing in the form of majority terror. **********The rallies, which are under the official sponsorship of the Socialist Alliance, a mass organization under party control, hear fiery speeches charging that Serbs are threatened with genocide, are victimized by rape, arson, assault and destruction of property and menaced by an explosion of the Albanian birth rate.  Ethnic Tensions Go From Simmer to Boil **********However justified the charges -violence and terror are known to have taken place, but their extent has not been substantiated - the meetings have provided the first unhindered outlet for long-submerged Serbian national feelings, a specter that has haunted this nation since its birth after World War I. Because Serbia was the largest and only independent state among Yugoslavia's members even before the founding of the new country and a victor nation of the first war while Croatia and Slovenia belonged to the defeated Hapsburg Empire, other Yugoslavs have tended to believe that only a weak Serbia can assure a strong Yugoslavia. **********Marshal Tito gave expression to this fear when he detached Kosovo and Vojvodina from Serbian administration by giving them provincial autonomy. Prof. Vojislav Stanovcic, a Belgrade University political scientist, said Serbia had less power over its citizens and territory than any other republic. **********''In the Serbian Parliament there are deputies from the two provinces, but no outsiders sit in the provincial Parliaments,'' he said. ''The republic cannot protect its citizens in the provinces. There is no appeal to republican courts from the provincial courts.'' **********''The idea has always been, since the 1920's, that one should be a little ashamed of being a Serb,'' said Prof. Mihailo Markovic, a political philosopher expelled from Belgrade University in 1975 for his liberalism and since then a frequent guest professor at the University of Pennsylvania. **********''Serbian national feelings have been suppressed for too long,'' said Mihailo Crnobrnja, Serbia's Economic Planning Minister and holder of a master's degree from the University of Maryland. ''There is some historical legitimacy to what is going on. It is politically wrong and unattainable to suppress the largest nation simply because it is the largest.''  Fears That Serbian Made a 'Faustian Pact' **********Many Yugoslavs acknowledge the sincerity and good will of people like Mr. Crnobrnja. But many deeply distrust Mr. Milosevic and the crowd passions that they accuse him of having inspired as the vehicle to carry him to power. Even Serbian intellectuals who share at least some of the party chief's nationalist goal often dislike his means. **********''I still don't like him,'' said one of Serbia's leading novelists, who asked not to be identified. ''I like his program to unite Serbia, but he has aroused the national feelings of Serbs, and that is dangerous. It should be done only if the Russians were at the border. Nothing else is important enough to do that.'' **********Mr. Milosevic is accused of having reverted to what some described as ''Stalinist'' methods in purging leading figures from various institutions - chief among them are the main newspapers and television and radio stations. ''Politika is not a newspaper anymore,'' the novelist said of the nation's most respected and traditionally independent daily. ''It is now his information bulletin.'' **********''He has surrounded himself with authoritarian ciphers,'' a Western ambassador said. Professor Markovic said, ''He is ready to use people of doubtful reputation if they are ready to serve him.'' **********Under the men Mr. Milosevic has appointed, the Serbian press has carried on a vituperative campaign against any Yugoslav leader who has cautioned against the extreme opinions expressed at the rallies. The press has also condemned Yugoslavia's Albanians. Slovene leaders have been prime targets. **********''He has made a Faustian pact,'' said President Stanovnik of the nationalism of the masses that he accused Mr. Milosevic of having unleashed. ''Now the devil is out of the bottle, and he can't put it back.'' **********But another view is that the Serbian leader has already achieved a major victory through the pressure that the rallies have brought. Last week the Politburo approved his proposal for amendments to the Serbian Constitution to curtail the provinces' autonomy and bring their defense and foreign policies, as well as their security arrangements and court systems, under control of the republic. **********''Milosevic understood the issue of Serbia with two millstones around its neck,'' the Slovene President said. ''He understood that the only way to get legitimacy was to appeal in that way to the people.''  Putting Market Forces Above Communism **********The Serbian party chief is also a firm supporter of a series of economic draft laws and amendments to the federal Constitution that has allied him with many of his detractors, including the Slovene leadership, as well as Yugoslavia's foreign creditors. **********The measures, which if adopted will realize many of the International Monetary Fund's hopes, will greatly increase the application of market forces in Yugoslavia's economy, which is mired under the control of many layers of official bureaucracy, and open greater opportunities for a private sector and foreign investment. **********Other measures are designed to increase political liberalization, notably in increasing the number of candidates for offices while formally retaining the Communist Party's power monopoly and separating the party bureaucracy from an active role in Government and enterprise decision-making. **********''Socialism needs an instrument of coercion - the market,'' said Mr. Crnobrnja. ''Not administrative measures, not the police.'' **********''The public is impatient and wise,'' he continued. Asked how long the public's patience would last under the seemingly unending economic hardships, he replied, ''Under a good social program in place, the politicians would have at least 18 months.'' **********But many Yugoslav political and economic specialists, as well as diplomats, are skeptical that new measures can salvage a system that many believe has amply proved its incapacity of bringing well-being to this nation. **********Above all, they fear that the survival of a huge bureaucracy, with an interest in a status quo that provides their jobs, will sabotage any far-reaching changes. **********''The capacities of state socialism are exhausted,'' Professor Stanovcic said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/29/world/is-hirohito-free-of-war-guilt-the-risks-of-defying-a-taboo.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1988-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1237, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Is Hirohito Free of War Guilt?

And he was dismissed as chairman of a local patriotic association. Free Speech, but **********The furor over his statement reflects issues still unresolved here: the complex, emotional symbol that is the Emperor, his role in postwar Japan and the latent passions of a devastating war. It also suggests some of the anomalies in Japan's democracy, where the principle of free speech is tempered by unspoken agreements to avoid certain highly charged subjects. **********It is not that some Japanese do not agree with the Mayor. They just usually do not say so publicly. Even when the Emperor was in good health, most Japanese obeyed what they call the Chrysanthemum taboo, which covers information about the Emperor or his family, his wartime role or what happens when he dies. **********The Mayor's comments have particular resonance here in Nagasaki, where the Americans dropped a second atomic bomb in August 1945 to jolt Japanese officials into agreeing to surrender. **********As Hirohito lies gravely ill, and most Japanese heed a tacit agreement not to criticize him, Mr. Motoshima's frankness is doubly shocking. 'A Stone in a Pond' **********''I didn't think that in a democratic society with freedom of speech, this would become such big news,'' he said, sitting in his office and flanked by security guards who even check the restroom before he uses it. ''But I feel as if I have thrown a stone in a pond - at a taboo issue and at the issue of free speech -and the ripples have been spreading.'' **********Mr. Motoshima threw his stone during a city assembly meeting, when a Japan Communist Party legislator asked him about the Emperor's war responsibility. The 66-year-old Mayor replied, in language that struck many Japanese as blunt: **********''If I look at the descriptions in Japanese and foreign histories, and reflect on my experiences in the military in the educational training of soldiers, in that regard I think the Emperor has war responsibility. But based on the will of a majority of Japanese and Allied countries, the Emperor escaped and became a symbol in the new Constitution, and we have to act under that understanding.'' **********Scholars in and out of Japan still disagree about the extent of Hirohito's influence on the conduct of the war. Many say he, like most of his ancestors, was a figurehead. Others say that at a time when the Emperor was so glorified that all Japanese were forced to bow and avert their eyes when they passed the Imperial Palace, he should have used this mystique to oppose advisers who wanted the war and should have stepped in earlier to stop it. Support for the Mayor, Too **********The Mayor said he has received more than 3,000 letters, postcards and telegrams, with more than 80 percent praising him for his forthrightness or recounting painful memories of relatives who died in the Emperor's name. A Nagasaki citizen's group that was formed to support the Mayor collected nearly 14,000 signatures in one week. **********Japanese newspapers published editorials criticizing those who would try to silence the Mayor, even though the press ordinarily avoids discussion of the Emperor's wartime role and has devoted scant coverage to many small-scale protests denouncing Hirohito, generally presenting a portrait of a nation united by respect. **********The editorials and the Mayor's supporters say the issue of free speech has taken on more urgency now, when the nation is facing the prospect of a new Emperor and fresh debate about what his role should be in an economically powerful Japan. **********''This is a test of the base of Japanese democracy,'' said Yasunori Takazane, an associate professor of French literature at Nagasaki University who is one of the organizers of the petition drive. Too Much Reverence? He and other scholars say they were particularly upset by the response of the Liberal Democratic Party. ''I think it's natural that the right wing would make a fuss,'' said Keiichi Tsuneichi, a professor of the history of science at Nagasaki University who is also backing the Mayor. ''But I was shocked by the Liberal Democratic Party's attitude, because it has much more influence and it's the party in power.'' **********Mr. Takazane and other Japanese have been troubled by what they see as excessive reverence toward the ailing Emperor. A public hall refused to rent space to a group that wanted to debate Hirohito's wartime role. **********Pressure from the rightists has also intimidated many who do not share their emotion about the Emperor. Many Japanese entrepreneurs have said they have had to promise to shut down and turn neon signs off when the Emperor dies or else risk being surrounded by rightist sound trucks that will hurt business. The Sound-Truck Bullies **********In the weeks since the Mayor spoke out, nearly 100 sound trucks have descended on the streets of Nagasaki, blaring threats against the Mayor couched in the same phrases used to identify targets for the waves of political assassinations that set Japan on the path to militarism in the 1930's. The trucks brought traffic to a standstill and prompted the city's schools to post signs asking for quiet, at least in school districts. **********Other groups, although they renounce the violent tactics of the right, have called on the Mayor to retract his words or resign. **********For Hosei Kitamura, a 28-year-old member of a new group opposing the Mayor, it is not a question of free speech, but one of propriety. **********''We just think it's improper to debate it when a person is ill in bed,'' he said. ''Perhaps when he recovers.'' People's Fears, and Their Hopes **********Mr. Kitamura said he does not oppose debate on the Emperor at an appropriate time, but believes that the Emperor's special place in Japanese hearts prevents them from discussing questions like war responsibility. **********''For Japanese, the Emperor itself might be a subject unsuitable for debate,'' he said. ''People may not feel it consciously, but they have a vague feeling of security because the Emperor is there. If we debate, people might feel this security was threatened.'' **********To the Mayor's supporters, this invocation of the Imperial mystique stirs uncomfortable echoes of prewar days. But they are taking heart from the public support for Mr. Motoshima. **********''I'm not necessarily pessimistic,'' Mr. Takazane said. ''I don't think we will go back to prewar days. People's feelings and hopes for democracy and freedom are now much more deeply rooted in Japan. That's how I felt collecting these signatures.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/world/appeal-for-african-refugees.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Appeal for African Refugees", "print_headline": "Appeal for African Refugees", "body_text": " **********The Organization of African Unity appealed today for emergency aid to help nearly six million refugees in southern Africa.

Administrative measures were taken against some of them instead. **********Peter Viggers, the Industry Minister for Northern Ireland, said today that unemployment among Protestant men was now 7 percent, compared with 17 percent among Catholic men. ''There are some Catholic neighborhoods where unemployment is as high as 80 percent,'' Mr. Viggers said. ''That is clearly unacceptable.'' Protestants make up 61 percent of Northern Ireland's 1.5 million people, and Catholics 39 percent, according to British Government estimates. These are only approximate because many people refuse to state their religion to census takers. **********The new bill, which Mr. Viggers said he hoped would become law next summer, would establish a Fair Employment Commission. It would make employers file reports on the religious affiliation of their employees, and on their hiring policies, and make determinations of which companies were not doing enough to insure equal opportunity in hiring or promoting. **********The legislation will not enable the commission to set quotas or reverse-discrimination measures, now unlawful in Britain, Mr. Viggers said. But it will prescribe affirmative action, defined in the law as ''steps taken to secure fair participation by both Catholics and Protestants in the workforce.'' **********The Fair Employment Tribunal the law would set up could obtain enforceable court orders and impose fines of up to $54,000 on employers who do not comply with its directives. The existing Fair Employment Agency, set up under a 1976 law whose inadequacy has been acknowledged by the Government, would be superseded. **********The new commission would consist of 12 men and women appointed by the Ministry of Economic Development for Northern Ireland. **********Mr. Viggers, clearly eager for understanding of the measure by the Irish-American community in the United States, told American journalists this morning that after its enactment the new legislation would give companies 28 days to register with the commission. Two months after that, they would be required to produce documentation of their monitoring procedures, and then the commission would have full latitude to decide what each company should do to insure fair employment. **********Mr. Viggers said, ''Proponents of the MacBride principles will say they've bullied us into the legislation, and I would deny it.'' The principles, named after the late Irish politician and international diplomat Sean MacBride, set standards for fair employment in Northern Ireland, and New York City and New York State are among the supporters of the principles. **********''I have no argument with MacBride on promoting fair employment,'' Mr. Viggers said. ''But the broad church of MacBride also has within it people who want to use it to promote disinvestment in Northern Ireland. We need to take tough measures against discrimination, but we also need to promote investment in Northern Ireland.'' **********A 1987 report by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, on whose report Mr. Viggers said much of the legislation was based, recommended a target of reducing the ratio of unemployment between Catholic and Protestant men from two and a half times to one and a half times within five years. **********The proposed law contains no such timetable, or partial goal.

Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, was the principal intermediary in the talks that produced a framework for further negotiations on the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. South Africa administers Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, in disregard of United Nations resolutions calling for its withdrawal. **********The plan, worked out during intensive negotiations on Governors Island in New York Harbor the week before, lists 14 general ''principles for a peaceful settlement in southwestern Africa.'' **********The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, including the United States, would serve as guarantors of any agreements eventually worked out. How they would insure compliance is unclear. For seven years, the United States has been trying to bring the South Africans, Angolans and Cubans into an agreement like the one approved this week, and on Wednesday, Washington endorsed that agreement. **********The United States has been providing antiaircraft missiles and antitank weapons since 1986 to Mr. Savimbi's guerrilla group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which is known from its Portuguese-language initials as Unita. The Savimbi guerrillas did not take part in the recent negotiations and are not mentioned in the regional peace plan. More and More Cubans **********Angola has received large quantities of military equipment, including an advanced air-defense network, from the Soviet Union. The Angolans have had major assistance from the Cubans, as well: American officials now estimate that there are 47,500 to 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola. This represents an increase of more than 10,000 Cubans over the last six months, the officials say. **********Mr. Savimbi has many supporters in the United States Congress who fear that the Reagan Administration will abandon him in its quest for a comprehensive settlement. Mr. Crocker said that would not happen because ''the question of our relationship to Unita is not a bargaining chip'' in the current negotiations. **********After 13 years of civil war, the guerrillas say they want ''a government of national reconciliation,'' in which they would share power with other political groups. The Angolan Government refuses to deal with Mr. Savimbi, calling him a puppet of South Africa. **********Marcos Samondo, a representative of Mr. Savimbi's group, said that if the Cuban troops went home, the Angolan authorities ''would have to find a political accommodation with Unita because they cannot survive 24 hours without Cuban troops.'' **********Moreover, he said: ''Once the Cubans are gone, I don't see any need for aid to Unita from the United States. Aid then ought to go to the central government of Angola, which would include Unita representatives.'' **********Administration officials say the situation in Angola is in some ways similar to that in Afghanistan, another place where President Reagan has armed guerrillas the Administration describes as ''freedom fighters.'' U.S. Arms Supply Continues **********In April, the United States endorsed the Geneva accords providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. But it reserved the right to continue sending weapons to the Afghan guerrillas if the Soviet Union provided assistance to the Kabul Government. In fact, the fighting has continued, and the guerrillas still receive American aid, though at reduced levels. **********Angola and Cuba have insisted that the United States end its support for Mr. Savimbi's men. But a State Department official rejected that demand, saying, ''If the parties concerned want to create preconditions for the mediator to do his job, they can find another mediator.'' **********Mr. Crocker said the acceptance of the 14 principles this week was an important step because it provided ''a set of guidelines for negotiators.'' An important next step is for the negotiators to draft a schedule for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Angola and Namibia. **********Donald F. McHenry, who served as United States representative at the United Nations during the Carter Administration, said, ''Nothing in the agreement gives me any hope that a settlement is imminent.'' **********Mr. McHenry helped devise the United Nations plan for Namibian independence. Under that plan, adopted by the Security Council in 1978, elections are to be held in the teritory for a constituent assembly. Many people believe the elections would be won by the South-West Africa People's Organization, or Swapo, the black nationalist group fighting for Namibian independence. **********Mr. McHenry, now a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, said: ''I see no reason for South Africans to be any more agreeable to the results of a referendum in Namibia now than they were in 1980. The results are likely to be a Swapo government, and the South Africans are on record as saying they would not tolerate such a thing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/business/finance-new-issues-orion-pictures-sets-12.75-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Orion Pictures Sets 12.75% Notes", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Orion Pictures Sets 12.75% Notes", "body_text": " **********The Orion Pictures Corporation is issuing $200 million of senior subordinated reset notes yielding 12.75 percent and due in 1998 through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********The notes have a 12 1/2 percent coupon and are priced at 99.378.

The people who work on the assembly line have taken charge and have the power to make management do their jobs right. **********The workers' revolution has finally come to the shop floor. The people who work on the assembly line have taken charge and have the power to make management do their jobs right. **********The revolution is not happening everywhere - yet. But it is happening at Nummi - that's New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the Toyota Motor Corporation-General Motors Corporation joint venture in Fremont, Calif. **********Nummi is the first Japanese-managed auto plant in the United States with a United Automobile Workers work force that is paid union wages and benefits. In just four years, it has achieved productivity and quality levels that exceed anything in the American auto industry, and which rival Japan's best. **********Its spectacular success, which has attracted attention in the United States and Europe, is not due to advanced robotics or sub-union wages. It is due to a revolutionary team production system run by the workers themselves. That system was worked out jointly with the plant's Japanese and American managers by the third partner in the joint venture - the U.A.W. And it the U.A.W.'srank-and-file workers who are making the team system work. **********The lessons of Nummi's success are still being resisted by executives, plant managers and foremen who see their authority threatened by the idea of power-sharing. It is also resisted by a few old-guard unionists who are uncomfortable with the idea of sharing responsibility with management for the plant's success in the marketplace. Nummi and the U.A.W. have also been the targets of a political disinformation campaign by a handful of 1960's-era leftists who are still hanging around the fringes of the trade union movement. These aging ''revolutionaries'' never imagined this kind of revolution. The Radicals Attack **********The radicals' attack on the team system has included opinion articles published in The New York Times and The Washington Post written by a pair of Detroit-based ''fringe'' journalists, Jane Slaughter and Mike Parker, who describe themselves as former auto workers. **********Contrary to the impression those opinion articles gave, neither of these journalists has ever worked at Nummi, nor done any on-the-spot reporting there. Neither our own local union people nor local management has any record of Mr. Parker or Ms. Slaughter ever setting foot in the plant. They have never even spoken with any of the U.A.W. people who played key roles in the creation of Nummi's team system. And their book ''Choosing Sides: Unions and the Team Concept,'' from which the opinion pieces were adapted, is an ''expert analysis'' of the team system pasted together from secondhand descriptions in newspaper articles, management treatises, and attacks by fellow leftists. Their book's slant clearly reflects an unstated political agenda. It certainly is not based on firsthand knowledge. Their attack on the team system rests on a widespread fallacy, shared by many ordinary Americans: that there is no way American workers can compete with the Japanese and Koreans except by working for sub-union wages. **********The team system we developed at Nummi is based on the principle that workers build cars; managers don't. Smart companies today are wiping out entire echelons of paper-pushers at corporate headquarters. Nummi has gone further by eliminating as much as possible of the management hierarchy within the factory itself. Its team system is based on shifting control over the production process down to the people who do the work on the assembly line - the people who know if the job is being done right. Worker Responsibility **********Instead of being hounded to push steel down the line even if all the seams are welded wrong, workers are being given the responsibility to see that no car moves on to the next station unless every job already done on it has been done perfectly. Instead of inspectors and repairmen tearing apart thousands of botched jobs at the end of the line, the workers who do the jobs are providing ''zero-defect'' quality inspection all along. **********Jobs are set up to be as easy as possible, with every part and tool ready at hand so workers can give full attention to quality control at every step. Partially assembled cars are swung onto their sides or raised up into the air so workers will not have to bend or stoop or twist to install the next part. Teams of workers who handle a series of related assembly operations are encouraged to come up with better ways to set up those operations so they can be done more easily and efficiently, without the exhaustion and time pressure that lead to mistakes. **********The attacks on the team system by former auto workers who have never set foot in the plant use sociological jargon to disguise deliberate political disinformation. They speak of the Nummi plan in terms of: *********** Regimentation. In any automobile plant there is a right way to do every job. But at Nummi it is the teams of workers who do those jobs - and who know them inside out - who tell the company what that right way is. *********** Taylorism. Taylor's time-and-motion study engineers are the hated management tools who prowl traditional assembly lines with stop watches, hounding foremen and workers to quicken the pace by another one-hundredth of a second. Nummi has achieved its enormous productivity gains by abolishing these engineers and leaving worker teams and groups to work out the pace that maximizes production and minimizes mistakes. *********** Speed-up. Every team that figures out a simpler way to get a job done is speeding up production. But the team members are not moving faster or working harder. They are increasing the plant's productivity and competitiveness while making jobs easier. *********** Management by stress. When a worker pulls a cord lighting up the signal board over the line to warn that there is a quality or safety problem at his work station, the pressure is on his team and the group leaders to help him solve it before the line automatically stops. **********In a system where every assembly worker is a quality inspector, the plant's line managers are the ones under pressure to prevent snafus that keep the worker from doing his job right. The pressure in the team system is not from the top down, it's from the bottom up. *********** Appropriating workers' knowledge to create profits for the bosses. This charge by the radicals sounds like warmed-over academic Marxism to me. But good old Karl Marx never dreamed of the union wage and benefit scales our members would earn by their skills and their smarts. **********There is obviously an unstated political agenda behind all this jargon. The giveaway is Mr. Parker's and Ms. Slaughter's nostalgia for ''traditional'' us-against-them factory practices. Arrogant managers and angry workers, constant battles over the details of every worker's job assignment, a maze of restrictive job classifications barring one worker from doing another's job, crippling absenteeism, firings, strikes, sick-outs, sabotage. In the 1970's, such plants had a few fringe leftists thinking that the revolution was finally on the way. **********Unfortunately, those plants were not very good at building cars, cars capable of meeting the quality and cost standards set by Japanese imports. From the early 1970's through the early 1980's, arrogant corporate management and self-destructive labor-management warfare wrecked and shuttered factories across the country, as consumers refused to buy the products they were turning out. Interestingly, in over 200 pages of ''analysis'' of the team system, Nummi's attackers never offer any explanation of how plants torn apart by labor-management infighting could possibly survive in a competitive international market. But then, economics has never been the left's strong point. Lost Jobs **********Assembly-line work is always going to be physically demanding, even when the workers themselves help to plan every step of the process. But the stress involved in competing successfully in a tough auto market does not compare to the stress our members suffered when everything they had ever worked for was lost. **********In California we have tens of thousands of members who lost their jobs when the old GM and Ford Motor Company plants shut down in the early 1980's. Many saw their own cars repossessed, their homes foreclosed and their families broken up under the strain. Shop-floor battles couldn't save the jobs of workers at the old GM Fremont plant. But the U.A.W. leadership did - by helping to create the Nummi joint venture and its revolutionary labor relations. **********Nummi is now at the leading edge of a sea change taking place in American factory management. Decades of managerial arrogance and disregard for the consumer cost American industry hundreds of plants and millions of jobs. Today, at the eleventh hour, progressive companies pushed by progressive unions are finally beginning to put those disastrous mistakes right. Even at GM, long the most conservative and bureaucratic of the Big Three, top executives who have done tours of duty at Nummi are now back in Detroit pushing its ideas. Union Training **********Here in California, we in the U.A.W. have set up our own nonprofit job training venture, the Labor Employment and Training Corporation, with directors representing both labor and management. This corporation has already retrained thousands of workers in new skills and found them jobs inside and outside the auto and aerospace industries. Thanks to the special expertise we have acquired through our partnership in Nummi, the Labor Employment and Training Corporation has been asked by major aerospace companies to come into their plants and show them how to retrain workers and managers in the team approach. **********The U.A.W. has been telling Detroit for years that people who make things with their hands take pride in workmanship. We have said workers will cooperate enthusiastically in finding ways to do a job better if managers are smart enough to tap into their pride and expertise. **********Quality and workmanship are finally being seen as crucial to our national competitiveness. Quality and workmanship do not come from running factories on stress - that's the old-line management system. They come from running the plant on pride.  At the non-union plants run by Honda in Ohio and Nissan in Tennessee, workers have had no way of participating, as our people did from the start, in the design and creation of their plant's production system. One Japanese executive who has toured those plants says that, as a result, their non-union work forces do not measure up in terms of quality to the U.A.W. workers at Nummi. **********In fact, Japanese auto executives are now saying privately that Nummi's American-built cars are outperforming most Japanese cars on quality. They are also saying that the secret of the joint venture's success is the pride and morale of the third partner in the plant - the U.A.W rank and file on the assembly line. **********That's not the revolution some people were looking for. But it's a revolution a lot of real trade unionists have worked hard to bring about."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/07/business/credit-markets-note-and-bond-prices-sluggish.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1988-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 703, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Note and Bond Prices Sluggish", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Note and Bond Prices Sluggish", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved sluggishly in a very narrow range for the fourth consecutive session yesterday, as market participants nervously awaited this morning's report on September employment. **********Anxiety about the report was best reflected in the secondary Treasury bill market, where interest rates on three-month bills rose sharply. **********''People don't want the short end and are willing to extend,'' one government bond trader said.

It goes deeper than that. **********It may be that in the proliferation of grammar-checkers, each new software package will announce more errors that the program will ''catch,'' even if the errors exist only in the imagination of the software writers. As a consequence, writers without grammar-checkers will worry about matters of surpassing triviality. **********Will there come a time when writers will concern themselves less with grammatical folklore and more with the problems of deeply confused prose? Not so long as software producers promise insecure writers that an expensive grammar-checker will save them from their most serious problems. JOSEPH M.

ACCEPTED ISRAEL", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat said today that the Palestine Liberation Organization accepted the existence of the state of Israel. His statement, which he presented as a milestone, was immediately dismissed in Israel and greeted coldly by the United States. **********After a two-day meeting with five prominent American Jews here, a P.L.O. delegation led by Mr. Arafat said in a joint statement that the Palestinian parliament in exile last month had ''accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region'' and ''declared its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms.''  [ Text of statement, page A10. ] **********At a news conference, Mr. Arafat said, ''We accept two states, the Palestine state and the Jewish state of Israel.'' **********The Palestinian leader portrayed the statement as an important clarification of the declaration last month in Algiers by the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O. legislative body. After the Algiers meeting, debated had raged over whether the Palestinians had implicitly recognized Israel and truly renounced terrorism. **********In Jerusalem, Israeli leaders discounted the Stockholm declaration and Mr. Arafat's comments. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres characterized them as a ''cunning exercise in public relations.'' What was needed, he said, was ''a commitment in reality'' to an end to violence. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was similarly dismissive. **********The United States has long said it would not deal with the P.L.O. until it stated unambiguously that it recognized Israel's right to exist and United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which lay out the basis for a negotiated settlement and peace in the Middle East. The United States has also asked for an unequivocal statement that the P.L.O. renounces all forms of terrorism. **********The statement today fell short of meeting these longstanding American requests in that it continued to attach conditions like discussing United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian question at an international conference. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in New York for the visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, expressed the American unhappiness. **********The United States, he said, had ''for a long time certain set things that we have said must be said by the P.L.O.'' He had only a brief report of the Stockholm meeting, he said, but ''so far as it's been reported to me, they haven't met these conditions.'' Previous Ambiguity **********At the Algiers meeting, Mr. Arafat would not say whether the Palestinian council's declaration represented a recognition of Israel. Some Palestinian hard-liners said it did not. There was no public explanation today of why Mr. Arafat was willing to say in Stockholm what he had declined to say in Algiers. Nor was there any indication of how his Stockholm remarks would be received in Arab countries. **********The P.L.O. chairman said of today's statement: ''Its significance is that it is an accurate reading and interpretation of the Palestine National Council declaration made in Algiers,'' declaring that it was ''clear and unambiguous.'' **********In his view, he went on, the importance of the Stockholm meeting was to ''give a push to the peace process.'' **********The P.L.O. statement comes a week before Mr. Arafat is scheduled to address a special session of the United Nations General Assembly in Geneva. The session was moved from New York to Geneva after Secretary of State Shultz refused to give Mr. Arafat a visa to enter the United States on the ground that as chairman of the P.L.O., he was an accessory to terrorism. Swede Sees 'Breakthrough' **********Foreign Minister Sten Andersson of Sweden, who arranged the meeting between the P.L.O. delegation and the five American Jews, said the statement represents ''a breakthrough in the peace process'' because ''the P.L.O. explicitly accepts Israel as a state.'' **********The American Jews who met in Sweden with the P.L.O. urged the United States Government to begin talking with the P.L.O. **********''We hope deeply that the U.S. Government will now open a dialogue with the P.L.O.,'' said Rita E. Hauser, who heads the American arm of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, a Tel Aviv-based research group. ''The P.L.O. has stated what the U.S. has demanded since 1975.'' **********For the P.L.O. to be invited to any meaningful peace talks, it must convince the United States Government that it has truly embarked on a course of moderation, favoring negotiation over acts of violence. **********The members of the American Jewish delegation emerged from their talks with the Palestinian chairman convinced that a real shift in policy and tactics had occurred. In particular, they cited the P.L.O.'s acceptance of a ''two-state solution'' to the conflict in the Middle East, meaning that both Israel and a Palestinian state can exist side by side. **********''A historic change has taken place in the attitude and the analysis by the P.L.O. of the situation in Middle East,'' said Abraham L. Udovitch, professor of Middle Eastern history at Princeton University, who was one of the five Americans at the Stockholm meeting. **********In the private sessions, Jewish participants said, Mr. Arafat repeatedly asserted that the Algiers document ''abrogated and nullified'' the P.L.O. charter, a declaration dating to the 1960's that called for the destruction of the state of Israel. Don't Speak for Everyone **********The Americans meeting with Mr. Arafat have been criticized by some Jewish organizations and the Israeli Government as unrepresentative of all Jews and for being exploited by Mr. Arafat in his effort to fashion a moderate image for the P.L.O. **********In response, the American participants stressed that they did not pretend to represent Jews as a community, but came because they felt their participation could be constructive. **********''Any time you get involved in something political, you are being used to some extent,'' said Stanley Sheinbaum, the economist and publisher, who is a regent of the University of California at Los Angeles. ''But I don't mind being used if it furthers the process of peace in the Middle East.'' **********In addition to Mrs. Hauser, Professor Udovitch and Mr. Sheinbaum, the American Jewish participants were Drora Kass, executive director for the American branch of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, and Menachem Rosensaft, a founder of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. **********The Swedish Government first got in touch with some of the Jewish participants in April. Foreign Minister Andersson said he believed that a meeting between American Jews and the P.L.O. could be constructive. **********The statement today was essentially agreed upon at talks in Stockholm on Nov. 21, which were attended by Mrs. Hauser, Mr. Sheinbaum and Ms. Kass and a small group of senior Palestinian officials led by Khalid al-Hassan, co-founder of the P.L.O."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/business/vanguard-shareholder-vote-asked.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 303, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vanguard Shareholder Vote Asked", "print_headline": "Vanguard Shareholder Vote Asked", "body_text": " **********John C.

Move Seen as Less Urgent **********Fed policy makers met again on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, and many analysts believe the central bank discussed increasing its discount rate, the interest it charges to make loans to banks, which is now 6 percent. Some economists suspect that such a move has become less urgent because of signs that the economy is slowing a bit. **********An increase in the discount rate, which was last raised in September, is the strongest signal the central bank can send of its intention to push interest rates higher. **********The minutes of the May meeting confirmed suspicions of analysts that the Fed moved in late May to tighten credit conditions because of concerns that the economy was growing so fast in the first part of the year that it was putting severe pressures on prices and wages. Tightening in March and May **********The last tightening move followed two earlier moves to push interest rates higher in late March and in early May. The central bank's goal was to restrain credit and thereby curb overall demand in the economy. It accomplished this objective by restricting slightly the amount of money that banks have available to make loans, thus pushing up the price of that money. **********A variety of interest rates, including the bank prime lending rate, and mortgage rates, did move higher in the spring, partly as a result of the Fed's tightening moves. **********The minutes of the May meeting showed that Fed officials remained concerned about the rate of economic growth. ''The members generally agreed that some further tightening of reserve conditions was needed to counter the risks of rising inflationary pressures in the economy,'' the minutes said. ''A failure to act in a timely fashion not only would be inconsistent with the committee's commitment to achieving price stability over time but would in fact compound the difficulties of accomplishing that objective.'' Risks Called Considerable **********The two dissenters argued that the central bank should be doing more than the small tightening steps it was contemplating. Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Parry argued that ''the risks were considerable that price and wage inflation would accelerate from rates that were already too high.'' They said that, unless the Fed did more, it ran the risk that it would have to drive interest rates up even more sharply later in the year to get inflation under control. **********The Federal Open Market Committee, made up of the Fed governors and presidents of six of the Fed's regional banks, also reviewed monetary policy through the first half of the year to decide whether any changes were needed in the monetary growth targets.

''This is not a nationalist problem. It is a question of democracy and human rights.'' **********The disputed enclave, whose population is mostly Armenian, is a part of the republic of Azerbaijan. But Armenians have staged large demonstrations and strikes to demand the annexation of the territory, whose leadership recently voted to endorse such a move. **********The demonstrations, which have set off violent confrontations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, have represented the toughest test yet of Mr. Gorbachev's ability to keep control as he encourages broader political freedom. And Mr. Gorbachev, who sided against the Armenian demands in a key Kremlin vote on July 18, has dispatched thousands of troops to quell the disturbances. **********Officially, the Soviet Government acknowledges that 35 people have died in the unrest, but Mr. Airikyan and other dissidents have asserted that the actual number of deaths may be as high as 600. **********''This is yet another example of how perestroika and glasnost are doubtful, if not completely a game,'' Mr. Airikian said.

If so, you're not alone. Thousands of potential buyers have been flocking to real estate auctions from coast to coast recently, as auctioneers try to upgrade the industry's image. **********''Auctions have taken a big turn,'' said Jay Quigley, a sales representative in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office of Sheldon Good & Company, a major real estate brokerage and auction firm. ''They're no longer just a vehicle to sell distress properties under duress situations.'' **********''With auctions, we're trying to change the way real estate is sold,'' said Bonnie Barkley, an executive in the Tampa, Fla., office of R. Thomas Ashley, a nationwide real estate firm. ''The typical concept of an auction is one of liquidation. But we seldom handle foreclosed property. Our clients are major developers who want to sell their property quicker than they would with a conventional sales program.'' **********Despite these declarations, most of the auctions already conducted or planned this year are in areas where the local economy is in trouble or where developers have overbuilt. Many auctions, for example, have been held in the oil patch states of Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, or in resort areas where property isn't moving quickly, like the coastal sections of North and South Carolina, the east and west coasts of Florida and some ski areas in Colorado and Utah. **********Typically, the property put up for bid consists of large blocks of single-family homes or condominium or town house units in the same development. The homes and units are usually auctioned off one at a time. **********For sellers, the appeal of an auction is time. They can unload their inventory of unsold property in several months - allowing for the closing - rather than waiting several years. The trade-off is a discount, expressed as a percentage off the latest appraisal, sale price or asking price. This price break makes an auction appealing to the buyer. While it is possible to buy at a discount of 50 percent, the typical reduction is 10 to 15 percent. **********And despite the perception that auctions of residential property are just for investors or developers on the prowl for a good deal, most buyers are ordinary folks. ''The vast majority are individuals, generally mom and pop types,'' said Tom Webb, chief administrative officer of Hudson & Marshall Inc. of Macon, Ga., a major auction firm. **********To register at an auction and obtain a bid card, you generally must bring a certified or cashier's check (made payable to yourself) for $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the property and the auction company. You must be prepared to come up with the rest of the purchase price in short order - generally 30 to 45 days. **********But finding a mortgage can turn out to be fairly simple. The reason is that the auction companies arrange for lenders, like banks and insurance companies, to be present. Typically, the lenders offer a smorgasbord of loan plans and repayment schedules. Title insurance companies typically are also present. **********Generally, the cost of the auctioneer's commission (which can range from about 4 1/2 to 7 percent) is built into the selling price. But occasionally you may have to pay a ''buyer's premium'' directly to the seller. This can range from 3 to 10 percent, with the higher amount often charged on properties with relatively low selling prices, like undeveloped land going for $20,000 or $30,000 a parcel. **********Before you raise your bid card, it's helpful to know some of the auction jargon. In many auctions, property is sold subject to ''seller's reserve.'' This means the seller has the right to reject the high bid if he or she feels it is inadequate. **********''Most sellers use the auction to get a sense of where the market is, and accept bids on the spot, although they are allowed up to 48 hours to accept or reject an offer,'' said Gordon J. Greene, president of the real estate auction division of the Chicago-based Good & Company. **********In other auctions, property is offered ''absolute.'' This means the property will be sold to the highest bidder, regardless of the amount of the bid. **********Finally, property can be sold with a ''minimum bid.'' This means the seller specifies ahead of time the lowest bid he will find acceptable. **********The following are hints from auctioneers: *********** Carefully inspect the property ahead of time. ''You should exercise due diligence, and walk through the auction property just as you would any other one,'' said Joel D. Zegart, president of JBS & Associates Inc., a Chicago real estate and auction firm. Most properties are sold ''as is,'' so check the condition of the appliances and other amenities since it is likely that warranties have expired. Most auctioneers will have open-house periods for three or four weeks before the sale. *********** Scrutinize the condominium association declaration, and check to see whether the assumptions underlying the budget forecasts seem reasonable. Also try to determine whether the association has the financial reserves to pay for major ''deferred maintenance'' projects such as a new roof. *********** Don't set your sights on just one unit. If, for example, 10 one-bedroom units in a development are to be auctioned, make sure you inspect at least four or five even if you prefer just one. The reason, Mr. Greene said, is that in many auctions the high bidders in the first round can take their pick of all 10 units; the high bidders in the second round get their choice of the remaining nine, and so on until the last one is sold. If you visited only the unit you liked, you may walk away empty-handed even though other units may have been acceptable. *********** Examine the sales contract, and show it to your lawyer or accountant well before the auction. Steer clear of a contract that does not make the sale contingent on your obtaining financing. *********** Most important, decide how much you are going to pay and stick with your limit. Try to remain dispassionate about the sale, and refrain from getting caught up in a bidding war. **********IF you wind up with second thoughts about a property you have successfully bid on, you may be able to back out, depending on the state in which the auction is conducted. **********Many states, including New York, Florida, California and Maryland, have ''rescission periods'' that permit consumers to cancel the deal even if they have already signed a contract. This ''buyers' remorse'' period can range from 3 to 10 days, depending on the state and the type of property being auctioned. It may be mentioned in the sales agreement, but don't count on it. Your best protection is not to bid if you have any doubts about the property and its price. **********If you are interested in taking part in an auction, get in touch with the auctioneers directly: Hudson & Marshall (800 841-9400), Good & Company (312 346-1500), R. Thomas Ashley (813 885-8800), JBS (312 527-0777) and other major firms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/12/world/reagan-vows-to-support-sihanouk-s-forces.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan Vows to Support Sihanouk's Forces", "print_headline": "Reagan Vows to Support Sihanouk's Forces", "body_text": " **********President Reagan told Prince Norodom Sihanouk today that the Administration regards him as a pivotal leader in a future Cambodian government and that it will increase aid to the non-Communist Cambodian opposition, Administration officials said today. **********Mr. Reagan also told Prince Sihanouk, the former Cambodian head of state that the United States supports an international conference on Cambodia and a United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping force to guarantee an eventual settlement of the Cambodian civil war. **********Prince Sihanouk controls one of the two non-Communist opposition factions seeking to oust the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian regime, Prince Sihanouk's 10-minute visit with Mr. Reagan was the Prince's first visit to the White House in the Reagan years.

Just two days ago, the White House postponed notification after a bipartisan group of 187 representatives made public a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz calling on the Administration to withdraw the sale in light of the missile purchase. Delay for Consultations **********Administration officials said the delay was necessary to give them time to consult with Congress about the importance of the arms sale, which includes $325 million in support and training for Awacs early-warning surveillance planes, and Bradley fighting vehicles and anti-tank missiles worth about $500 million. The Administration has argued that the Saudi Awacs provide vital protection for United States naval forces in the region. **********Today's notification follows a decision by Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers this week to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, a gesture meant to show that Riyadh has no intention of acquiring nuclear warheads for its new ballistic missiles, which have a range of up to 1,700 miles. In addition, the Saudis broke diplomatic relations with Iran. Both moves seemed calculated to gain more support in Congress. **********It is unlikely, however, that the Saudi decision to rule out nuclear weapons will assuage the fears of many lawmakers, who are less concerned about the potential nuclear capability of the missiles than their ability to reach Israel. The lawmakers are also worried about a new arms race in the Middle East involving missiles. **********''I was surprised and chagrined that the Administration made formal notification today,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, who helped gather signatures for the House letter. He predicts that the sale will be defeated in both houses of Congress. **********The House letter was drafted after a similar letter signed by 58 senators called for a delay of the sale until American policy on Saudi arms sales could be re-examined. Statement From Pentagon **********But Administration officials believe that the arms sale will eventually gain Congressional approval because the lawmakers are primarily concerned about the Chinese missiles, not the United States arms sale per se. In addition, the Reagan Administration is convinced that Congress does not want to be accused of damaging American policy in the Persian Gulf. **********A Pentagon statement said the sale would ''contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be an important force for progress in the Middle East.'' **********If Congress does not voice an objection to the sale within 30 days, it will automatically proceed. **********The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today that Iranian charges that Washington had pressured Saudi Arabia to sever diplomatic relations with Teheran were ''absolutely false.'' **********Officials said the estimated value of the Awacs portion of the package was scaled back to $325 million from $450 million after negotiations with the primary contractor, the Boeing Company of Seattle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/02/business/briefs-148888.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********DEBT  Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co. is offering $100 million worth of 12 percent notes priced at par and due on June 1, 2000, through Salomon Brothers Inc. *********** Days Inns of America Inc. is issuing $175 million in 12.74 percent notes due in 1993 through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. *********** Prime Motor Inns Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a proposed offering of $100 million in convertible subordinated debentures due in 2013 through Montgomery Securities. *********** Student Loan Marketing Association is offering $160 million in 8 percent fixed-rate notes priced at 100 1/ 32 and due on June 30, 1989."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/28/business/china-seeks-gatt-tie.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Seeks GATT Tie", "print_headline": "China Seeks GATT Tie", "body_text": " **********China has made its case for readmission to the international trade body GATT, saying it no longer has a centrally planned economy and is reforming its system of foreign trade, GATT delegates said today. **********In a meeting that was being extended to Thursday, a high-level Beijing delegation called for China's early return to the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

But what this means in real terms is still unclear, since no figures are currently available on how much of the stock has been repurchased. Many of the announcements were simply accelerations of repurchases that had been previously planned, and in the case of many fast-growing small companies, no purchases of any size have been made. **********''A lot of companies bought small amounts of stock in the first week when the prices were low,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment policy analyst at Drexel Burnham. ''But when the stock prices rose, they decided not to buy.'' 'Sending a Message' **********Take the Arkansas Best Corporation, a trucking company based in Fort Smith, Ark., that on Oct. 21 announced plans to repurchase two million shares, or 20 percent of its stock. So far, it has bought back only about 130,000 shares. ''I don't think we ever intended to repurchase two million shares,'' said Randall Loyd, the company's director of investor relations. ''We did it to build confidence. It was corporate America sending a message.'' Mr. Loyd said the company felt the money was better invested in its operations than in stock repurchases. **********Stock buybacks can help bolster a company's stock price. With fewer shares outstanding, the earnings per share automatically increase, as does the price-earnings ratio - both critical factors to investors in determining the value of a company's stock. **********Many executives were undoubtedly eager to raise their stocks' prices after the market collapse, because the plunge had made their companies cheaper and more vulnerable to a takeover attempt. A buyback can also can make a company a less attractive takeover candidate by increasing its debt level relative to its total capital and reducing its available cash. **********Companies announced a record level of planned stock buybacks in 1987. Statistics from Salomon Brothers show that some $75.7 billion worth of repurchases were announced last year, nearly double the $39 billion announced the previous year. More than half of the year's total came after Oct. 19. **********Some experts say that the post-crash attempts to bolster investor confidence paid off. ''The short-term impact was obviously there,'' said Robert R. Glauber, executive director of the White House commission that investigated the collapse. ''Investors knew that there were buyers out there who would put a cushion underneath the market.'' Wall Street's Plea for Help **********Wall Street certainly has made no secret of its frantic efforts to get corporate clients to announce buybacks. **********''We called and cried 'Help,' '' said Peter DaPuzzo, a senior executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''We said: 'You needed Wall Street three years ago when you issued stock. Now Wall Street needs you.' Things were irrational and people thought the world was coming to an end. Many, many times, there was pleading from an emotional point of view.'' **********Under Federal securities laws, it is illegal to announce plans to make a stock buyback if the corporation in question never intended to follow through. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of its broad investigation of the market collapse, is studying the buybacks. However, the S.E.C. has said the main purpose of its investigation is to understand what happened in October and not to bring charges against specific companies. **********Clearly, many companies had been contemplating buybacks even before the market collapse and saw in the plunge an opportunity to proceed. **********The restructuring wave that had caused many corporations to buy and sell divisions had left many flush with cash, while relatively healthy business conditions through the early 1980's had increased the cash flow of others. **********''Corporations were cash-rich, and no one was spending money to buy plant and equipment because of the uncertain economic outlook,'' said Laszlo M. Birinyi Jr., a market analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. **********It is for that reason that stock buybacks have been roundly attacked: critics believe that instead of repurchasing their shares, corporations should be investing their money in the plants, property and equipment that can help their companies - and the economy - to grow. **********''A buyback program is a decision about capital structure, and you probably ought to be doing other things, such as investing in plant and equipment or research,'' said Mr. Glauber of the White House commission, who is also a professor at Harvard Business School. **********Ms. Cohen of Drexel agreed. Do stock buybacks ''really affect the long-term growth of the economy, let alone of the individual companies? That's where we don't view buybacks as an absolute blessing.'' Executives Dismiss Criticism **********The executives of several large corporations dismissed such criticism, saying that they can finance buybacks without scrimping on capital outlays. And they say there were many good reasons to announce buybacks. **********''The buyback doesn't impinge on our capital spending,'' said Bruce Thomas, chief financial officer of the USX Corporation, which announced a 20-million-share buyback on Oct. 20 and has since bought 5 million shares. **********Even after spending about $140 million on those purchases, USX has more than $1 billion in excess cash. The repurchased shares will offset new shares that USX issued to finance its January 1986 acquisition of the Texas Oil and Gas Corporation and provided USX with shares for investors who had recently converted a USX convertible bond. ''We had been on the verge of doing a stock buyback for about three months,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''Black Monday made it easier.'' **********In addition, USX felt it had to announce a buyback plan to try to protect its stock price, Mr. Thomas said, noting that the Wall Street firm that specialized in making a market for USX's stock, A. B. Tompane, suffered huge losses when the market collapsed and was forced to combine with Merrill Lynch. ''We had to be another bulwark if the specialist didn't do his job properly,'' he said. 'A Good Investment' **********The Ford Motor Company believes that its stock buybacks are ''a good investment for shareholders,'' said Stanley A. Seneker, an executive vice president. **********Before the market collapse, Ford had been purchasing an average of 100,000 shares a day under a 90-million-share-buyback plan begun in November 1984, he said. The week of the market collapse, Ford stepped up its daily purchases to about 460,000 shares, Mr. Seneker said, but has since scaled them back - even though it announced a $2.5 billion repurchase plan in December that would result in the buyback of about 10 percent of its shares. **********Burlington Northern Inc., which announced a plan to purchase five million shares on Oct. 20, has so far bought some 500,000. ''The timing was motivated by a need to signal the investment community that Burlington Northern had a bright future,'' said Don L. Pope, a spokesman for the company, which typically repurchases about one million shares a year. **********The purchases have been financed by cash from Burlington Northern's operations, which include three mature businesses - railroads, pipeline and forest products - that generate substantial cash but require little in the way of capital outlays. Mr. Pope said the stock buyback ''doesn't diminish'' the company's ability to finance its operations. **********The same views were expresed by the Eaton Corporation and the NCR Corporation. **********Eaton had announced a $500 million buyback plan, and so far has spent some $150 million to buy two million shares. This follows another $500 million repurchase plan that ended last summer. ''We would never consider using capital that would compete with what we need to run and grow our business,'' said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman of Eaton. **********NCR has bought about 45 percent of the 10 million shares it had announced plans to buy on Oct. 26. ''We're growing the business as fast as we can,'' said Robert Kramer, an NCR spokesman. ''We had some excess cash, so this seemed to be an outstanding investment.'' NCR typically repurchases two million to four million shares a year. Smaller Companies Balk **********Executives of several fast-growing, smaller companies, unlike their counterparts in big corporations, indicated in interviews that they could not finance both expansion and buyback plans - and expansion would come first. ''We're a growth company, and it doesn't make sense to buy back our shares - unless the price gets dirt-cheap.'' said Mr. Loyd of Arkansas Best. **********TIE Communications, based in Shelton, Conn., has not made a single purchase since it announced plans to buy back 10 million of its shares on Oct. 20. ''We had better uses for our available cash,'' said Polly Parke, a spokeswoman for the company, which recently bought a division of Honeywell Inc. ''It doesn't mean that at some point we won't be'' repurchasing stock, she added, ''but that has to be considered against our other strategic goals.'' **********Fur Vault Inc., best known in New York as ''Fred the Furrier,'' has bought only about 770,000 of the three million shares it said it would buy. Sales of fur coats dropped along with the stock market, and ''we decided to conserve cash and wait to see what transpires,'' said Jack Balsam, the company's treasurer. **********Fairchild Industries, a military contractor in Chantilly, Va., has bought only about 250,000 shares of the three million its board of directors authorized it to buy after the market collapsed. Part of Fairchild's problem is that the stock is so thinly traded that little comes up for sale. ''There are no institutions or individuals offering up large blocks,'' said Deborah M. Tucker, the company's director of investor relations.  Stock Buybacks Surge After Market Plunge  Largest Post-Crash Repurchase Plans  Dollar figures in millions.

On a percentage basis, however, the 5.87 percent rise was nowhere near a one-week record. **********Reaction to the stock market's performance was mixed. While many traders were gratified that the market had snapped out of its recent doldrums, most were cautious.

Program Trading Cited **********''It's interesting, but I'm not sure it's significant,'' said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer for the First Albany Corporation, a large regional brokerage. Other analysts said that program trading related to index arbitrage, as well as short-covering by speculators, bolstered the market yesterday. **********''This was a hot-air rally,'' said one trader, who noted that every time the prices on stock-index futures contracts reached a certain premium above the cash indexes themselves, there was heavy buying of stocks. ''We had some buy programs, especially in the afternoon, after 2:30,'' he added. **********Other analysts, however, contended that the rally in stock prices was more significant. Frank X. Curzio, an investment newsletter writer, said he was calling his 2,000 subscribers to tell them ''the bear market is over.'' Rising Commodity Prices Ignored **********Many analysts and traders pointed out that both the stock market and the bond market, where prices rose and interest rates fell yesterday, were acting in opposition to news normally bearish to both: rising commodity prices. **********Market analysts said there could be several explanations for the seeming contradiction. For one thing, they said, many investors who had been sitting on the sidelines may now be speculating in commodities. For another, there is a belief that the Commodity Research Bureau index - a widely followed yardstick - is surging because a drought in the nation's Farm Belt is pushing up grain futures prices, causing a squeeze on short-sellers in the futures pits in Chicago. **********''There are those that say that as soon as there is rain, the C.R.B. will come down as sharply as it went up,'' one analyst said. ''That's why the stock and bond markets are ignoring the C.R.B.'' **********Whatever the reason for the rally in stocks, Mr. Johnson of First Albany is not convinced it can last. He said that, while recent economic data - yesterday's Government report on unemployment, earlier reports on personal spending, leading economic indicators, construction, manufacturing and housing starts - ostensibly pointed to a slowing economy and reduced inflationary pressures, they could also presage something else. **********''Dare I say a recession?'' he asked, adding that he thought it unlikely stock investors would get involved in a speculative ''frenzy'' so soon after the October market crash, no matter what the news. Inflation Worries Ease **********Traders said that if there was any one thing that sustained yesterday's stock market, it was that the Labor Department reported that the nation's overall unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent in May, from 5.4 percent in April. That apparently eased investor fears about the economy's overheating, and thus dampened worries about inflation. **********Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.12, to 266.45, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.64, to 150.31.

They were concerned about the increase in traffic and the Westchester project's impact on the environment and the surrounding community. **********WHEN Riverwoods, a 148-unit town-house project under construction in Chappaqua, N.Y., was proposed five years ago, neighbors banded together to oppose multifamily development of the scenic 123-acre site. They were concerned about the increase in traffic and the Westchester project's impact on the environment and the surrounding community. Residents hired lawyers, geologists and traffic engineers to present their case. **********Such conflicts are becoming commonplace as suburban neighborhoods fight to protect their last tracts of open space. But disputes often lead to concessions by both sides that benefit a project. Next month, the Urban Land Institute will use Riverwoods as an example of a meritorious development that evolved from a give-and-take approval process. **********''The land-use issue drew us to them and made them not just another project,'' said Reba Immergut, a planner with the institute, a nonprofit education and research organization in Washington that is concerned with improving standards of land use. Every year, the group cites 20 projects around the country that show innovative approaches to development. **********''At Riverwoods, the developer and the architect had to come up with ways to deal with the topography of the property as well as with community opposition,'' Mrs. Immergut said. **********The Riverwoods property is hilly. Woods cover 60 percent of it. The Kisco River winds through a valley for a half-mile. Steep slopes, rock outcroppings and minimal road frontage had discouraged development. **********Harvey Shapiro, a Manhattan developer, purchased the property in 1983 for $2.2 million. It had one-acre zoning, but he proposed building 212 units under a multifamily zoning category established by the Town of New Castle in 1978 under a court order. Chappaqua is a part of New Castle. **********The town's planning board reduced the density to 148 units because of environmental concerns over wetlands and the impact of high-density development on the Kisco River, which feeds into the Croton Reservoir, a major source of New York City's water supply. **********But residents feared that even a reduced number of units would change the character of their single-family neighborhood. So other concerns, such as placing units away from the property line so they would not abut existing houses, and making road improvements, were also addressed. **********''If I could leave land green forever, I would, but we did the best job one could do without confiscating a private individual's ownership of land,'' said Arnold Spurr, the planning board chairman. **********In return, Mr. Shapiro won concessions he felt were essential to making his high-priced project a success. **********''I was determined to maintain standards that promoted privacy, such as keeping buildings adequately separated from one another, and having individual units that resembled private houses and were attached only by their garages,'' he said. A strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance might have required the close clustering of buildings, and might have forced him to build houses that shared a common wall, rather than allowing the attachment of garage walls to make the project qualify for multifamily density, he said. **********David Smotrich of Manhattan designed traditional-style dwellings with the dimensions of single-family houses, rather than the deep, narrow units typical of attached housing. Each unit has four exposures, because only the garages have common walls. Most of the dwellings are built two to a building, and no building has more than three dwellings. **********Given the freedom to place the buildings throughout the property, rather than crowding them into a small portion of it, Mr. Smotrich and Erwin Potter of Sandy Hook, Conn., the landscape architect, were able to offer views for many of the units. And even though the buildings are spread out, more than 80 percent of the land will remain undeveloped. **********These special features result in prices that range from $379,900 to $525,000 for two- and three-bedroom units. Nevertheless, with maintenance of the grounds, recreational space and a private land preserve, the dwellings are an alternative to the large single-family houses that predominate in the community. **********Since sales began in May 1987, 44 units have been sold. Two-thirds of the buyers have been area residents. Others are mainly young families. Now that memories of the controversy are fading, former opponents have a few kind words for one another. Mr. Shapiro acknowledged that the larger units he is building better meet the needs of the local marketplace. He added, ''It's important to listen to what a community has to say because one can learn.'' **********Peggy Stallman, a leader of the opposition to the original plan, still feels that single-family houses would have been more appropriate. ''But if I have to have a multifamily project in my backyard,'' she said, ''I couldn't ask for a nicer-looking one.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/02/world/german-s-red-square-plane-offered-for-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1988-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 823, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German's Red Square Plane Offered for Sale", "print_headline": "German's Red Square Plane Offered for Sale", "body_text": " **********Mathias Rust may still be in a Soviet prison cell, but the single-engine plane he put down next to Red Square in Moscow a year ago has basked in a bit of celebrity since the Russians let it out of custody six months ago. **********Now, after touring West Germany and France gathering publicity for a small cosmetics company and signatures on a peace petition to Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S.

Asking Price Is $250,000 **********Mr. Neumann said he was asking $250,000, though he seemed pleased that one of the bidders had offered $120,000. When it was new in 1980, he said, the plane cost about 120,000 marks, or $70,000 at current exchange rates, and planes of that vintage were going for about 90,000 marks, or $53,000, today. **********He said he was basically looking to recoup what he had already spent buying and owning the plane - $94,000 to buy it and $118,000 since. **********''We are a very small company, not Estee Lauder,'' he said. ''The adventure with the plane is very hard for our financial position.'' **********The adventure is one Mr. Neumann insists he got into entirely by chance. Several months before Mr. Rust made his flight, Mr. Neumann said he got the idea of having mechanized gliders fly into several West German cities to promote his company. He got in touch with various flying clubs, including Aeroclub Hamburg, of which Mr. Rust was a member. **********Mr. Neumann said he never heard of Mr. Rust until the 19-year-old pilot made his landing in Moscow. But a week later, he said, Mr. Rust's uncle called and accused him of having sponsored the flight, a charge that soon made its way into the German press. **********''It was all untrue, but I was afraid of getting problems from the German press, which was accusing me and Azuma Royal of having paid him to fly to Russia,'' he said. So in what he described as a good will gesture, he went to Aeroclub and offered to buy the plane and get it out of the Soviet Union. **********But Mr. Neumann said he kept his ownership of the plane a secret until it was flown out in October. ''We thought that the Russians would think they were being ridiculed if they learned that a cosmetic company was going to do promotions with the plane,'' he said. **********Frank Hansen, the president of Aeroclub Hamburg, confirmed the sale, but said the club had paid 9,000 rubles to the Russians, then worth 26,300 marks, to get the plane back - a sum he said he intended to recover from Mr. Rust. **********In any event, the plane was flown out of Moscow by a West German pilot with a Soviet navigator. Mr. Neumann took the Russian's place for the last leg into Hamburg. **********Since then, he said, the Cessna has been to various cities in West Germany and France, promoting Azuma Royal and gathering signatures on two petitions to be presented to President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev, urging them to get rid of nuclear weapons and asking the Soviet leader to release Mr. Rust, who is serving a four-year prison term. **********''They're already destroying weapons,'' Mr. Neumann noted, and there were rumors that Mr. Rust might soon be set free. Currently, he said, the plane is on loan to the city of Hamburg. **********Mr. Neumann said his initial intention had been to have Sotheby's, the British auction house, auction the plane off in New York in October. The plan, he said, was that he would recoup the money he spent on the plane and donate the rest to a charity for children. **********But Mr. Neumann said that three weeks ago Sotheby's called and canceled the auction.

Nevertheless, studios generally put up advances for such films and pay for prints and advertising. Thus they must recoup those outlays before showing profits.

In theory, then, mass-market publishers should be cutting back on the number of books they publish, and other publishing houses should be thankful they are not in such a cutthroat end of the business. **********Instead, many publishers of mass-market books - the ubiquitous paperback novels and nonfiction titles on sale in bookstores and just about every corner store - are establishing new lines. And a number of publishers have recently joined the group or are about to. The 'Hard-Soft' Phenomenon **********What may sound like a death wish is actually an attempt to come to grips with a major change in the book publishing business in recent years: the proliferation of ''hard-soft'' deals, under which a book is jointly acquired by a hard-cover and a soft-cover house under the same corporate ownership. **********For example, Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books, each a unit of Gulf and Western, recently signed Mary Higgins Clark to a $10.1 million hard-soft contract for five books. Random House Inc., owned by Advance Publications, paid a reported $9 million for three books by Barbara Taylor Bradford, for publication by its Knopf and Ballantine imprints. Bantam Books, owned by Bertelsmann, bought both its Lee Iacocca books for hard-cover and paperback publication. **********William Morrow and Avon Books, owned by the Hearst Corporation, paid more than $5 million for James Clavell's ''Whirlwind.'' Delacorte and Dell, also owned by Bertelsmann, publish Danielle Steel in hard cover and paperback. G. P. Putnam's Sons and Berkley Books, both owned by MCA, jointly publish Tom Clancy and Dick Francis. And Warner Books, owned by Warner Communications, paid almost $5 million for the right to publish the sequel to ''Gone With the Wind'' in hard cover and paperback. Unit Sales Are Flat **********Although inflation and higher prices helped bolster mass-market sales from $854.8 million in 1983 to $1 billion last year, the number of units sold during that time declined slightly, from 607.7 million to 607.4 million. Marvin Brown, president of Viking Penguin, recently predicted that sales would remain flat and unsold returns high, even though mass-market books could remain profitable for houses that publish wisely and control costs. **********Mass-market sales have been flat because cover prices have risen sharply in recent years, because bookstores sell many hard-cover books at discount and the perceived value between hard-cover and paperback books has diminished, and because there are more bookstores across the United States, giving readers a bigger choice of other kinds of books. **********While some publishers like hard-soft arrangements, because they allow greater control over the entire publishing process of a book, the major push for hard-soft deals has come from big-name authors and their agents. In a conventional publishing arrangement, the author has to share reprint rights - the money earned from the sale of paperback rights - with the hard-cover house. But in a hard-soft deal, where the financing is all in the same corporate family, the author keeps the entire paperback advance. **********That is one reason more publishers are seeking a presence in mass-market books. A Number of Examples **********St. Martin's Press, for example, recently established its own mass-market publishing program, and now publishes 10 books a month. This month the Crown Publishing Group started its mass market division, Pageant Books, in association with Waldenbooks. Harper & Row, owned by the News Corporation and William Collins & Sons, has been considering starting a mass-market publishing program or buying an existing mass-market publisher. **********Little, Brown, owned by Time Inc., has also considered entering mass-market publishing. **********''It isn't easy to start a mass-market publishing program unless you have a lot of titles from your own hard-cover list,'' said Thomas J. McCormack, chairman of St. Martin's Press. ''But it's almost essential to have hard-soft capability, because authors want that full royalty.'' **********At the same time, conventional paperback publishers have started their own hard-cover publishing programs. Bantam and Warner Books, which were exclusively mass-market publishers, have become important hard-cover publishers. Zebra Books, another conventional paperback house, just started publishing hard-cover books and has already had two best sellers - the memoirs of Michael Reagan, the President's son, and Duke Snider's memoirs as a Brooklyn Dodger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/world/us-now-willing-to-finance-some-of-the-un-s-operations.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 533, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Now Willing to Finance Some of the U.N.'s Operations", "print_headline": "U.S. Now Willing to Finance Some of the U.N.'s Operations", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration is adopting a ''two-track'' approach toward financing the United Nations, agreeing to pay for new peacekeeping operations while continuing to withhold its regular contribution, according to a ranking Administration official. **********The official, Richard S.

Meeting on Fund Shortage **********On Thursday, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar is to meet with a committee of 21 United Nations members he has designated to advise him on the financial crisis facing the organization, which says it will run out of money in November largely as a result of the American failure to pay $467 million in back dues. **********Mr. Willliamson said the Administration was ''ready to cooperate fully'' over financing United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.

His remarks suggested that the policy of major governments toward the dollar appeared to have shifted recently from toleration of a slight rise. **********The dollar did rise again in New York trading today after losing a bit of ground in Europe against the two currencies by which its performance is most often measured, the yen and the West German mark. But two Government reports released this morning suggested that the ebullient American economy was simmering down in line with the Federal Reserve's desires. Pressure on Central Bank Eased **********The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to thwart inflation, and the rate increases have contributed to the dollar's recent surge. But today's reports on consumer prices and orders for durable goods suggested that inflation was not climbing as fast as the Federal Reserve feared, easing the pressure on the central bank to push up rates again. **********''You can say we're encouraged by the impact of the reports on the exchange markets and the economy generally,'' the senior official said. Characteristically, the official declined to be named, but his views can be considered fully compatible with those of the two agencies of currency policy, the White House and the Treasury. **********But the dollar's subsequent rise, which came despite the economic reports and modest dollar selling by the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks, suggests that Washington and other governments could be facing a difficult task in trying to hold the dollar steady. **********With the departure of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, currency policy is being managed by the Deputy Treasury Secretary, M. Peter McPherson, and Assistant Treasury Secretary David C. Mulford, while Mr. Baker's successor, Nicholas F. Brady, awaits Senate confirmation, probably in mid-September. The Treasury collaborates in defining currency policy with the White House and the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan. **********Such officials also took note of the weeks of concerted intervention in the markets - selling dollars to stem the rise - by the central banks of most major countries, including the Federal Reserve. The frequent, collaborative intervention implies that the other governments, like the Administration and the Federal Reserve, agree that continuing volatility in the markets and a further rise of the dollar from its recent higher level pose a variety of problems for their trade and inflation. **********A rising dollar undermines the Administration's effort to reduce the nation's huge trade deficit because it raises the prices of American goods overseas and lowers the prices of imported goods, enhancing their appeal to American consumers. Other nations fear that a sustained rise of the dollar will push their inflation rates up because they would have to pay more for imported goods that were priced in dollars, including oil. **********Many analysts say the dollar's current level seems a satisfactory compromise for all the major countries, if ideal for none, and that the governments are therefore likely to continue their intervention if the dollar starts rising again or, for that matter, starts falling much. **********''I suspect they don't want anything different for the dollar - not too high, not too low,'' said Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of the New York branch of the Nikko Securities Company and an analyst of currency policy. **********Neal M. Soss, a former Fed official who is an economist at the First Boston Corporation, said, ''I think that what they'd like is a degree of stability. The level of the dollar is not so much the issue as stability. They want stability that feeds on itself.'' **********From December through June, the Group of Seven industrial countries - the United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - said repeatedly that they wanted no further decline of the dollar, from the peak it reached in February 1985, and no rise if it threatened to destabilize their economies. **********From one statement to the next, the dollar rose, 17 percent since December against the mark, to the 1.90 range, and 7 percent against the yen, to the 135 range. The concerted intervention and official statements imply that these levels are the upper limits of a recent rise the countries are willing to tolerate, and that the Group of Seven nations want a steady dollar for months to come. Rise Despite Intervention **********As a sign of the problems the nations face in restraining the dollar, its rise in New York trading today came despite modest intervention. It remained above the important 1.90-mark level, closing at 1.9128 marks, up from 1.9068 on Monday. And it moved up to 134.11 yen, from 133.69 yen on Monday. **********The governments hold hundreds of millions of dollars in their treasuries to spend on intervention, but the markets contain billions. Intervention can discourage speculation for a while, but if the markets think underlying economic forces dictate a rising dollar, they can eventually overwhelm official intervention. **********Some economists and currency traders maintain that the shifts in the underlying world economy justify a stronger dollar. **********''The American trade deficit has contracted significantly,'' said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''The American economy looks stronger than those of Germany and the rest of the Continent, and I believe the relative acceleration of inflation in this country is likely to be less severe than in Japan and Germany. That makes the dollar more attractive.'' Eventual Decline Expected **********Many other analysts maintain, however, that the dollar will eventually have to decline some more to permit a substantial reduction of the trade deficit. **********Analysts attributed to the latest rise of the dollar in part to the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, notably the half-point rise in the discount rate on Aug. 9, to 6 1/2 percent. The higher American rates make investing in American securities more attractive than investments in those of countries with lower interest rates. **********The Fed raised the rates not to bolster the dollar but to slow the economy and thwart a rise in inflation. However, today's report on consumer prices suggests that significant further rate increases, which could drive the dollar higher, may not be needed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/business/company-news-rise-reported-in-sterling-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rise Reported In Sterling Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Rise Reported In Sterling Bid", "body_text": " **********Hoffmann-La Roche & Company is raising its bid for Sterling Drug Inc. to $81 a share, from $76, a person close to Hoffmann said last night. **********The new price would make the offer worth about $4.7 billion.

He said Iraqi troops, who sealed the frontier to Kurds seeking to flee into Turkey, ''would like to retain control of the area and show that they mean business.'' **********Western diplomats said they were less convinced that the Iraqi offensive had ended, but acknowledged that they no longer could hear gunfire across the Turkish-Iraqi border. Diplomats and journalists who visited the area in recent days reported that Iraqi soldiers at the frontier are in a relaxed mood. **********Even if the fighting has indeed ended, important questions linger about what occurred during the military operation, which is described by many political experts as a concerted attempt by Iraq to crush the long-rebellious Kurds for having supported Iran in the Iran-Iraq war. **********Iraqi soldiers began to advance in the Kurdish region shortly after Baghdad and Teheran began observing a cease-fire in their war on Aug. 20. The offensive prompted Kurdish guerrillas and ordinary citizens near the border to flee into southeastern Turkey, where about 60,000 of them are now sheltered in hastily erected tent cities. **********One uncertainty is the number of people who died in northern Iraq. Turkish officials and foreign diplomats say they have no idea. And, they add, with Iraq not likely to permit access to the affected areas, they may never know. **********Of perhaps greater international concern are accusations that Iraq has used chemical weapons against the Kurdish population. Refugees who reached Turkey have repeatedly said they fled after airplanes and helicopters dropped canisters of poisonous gas that killed fellow villagers. **********Iraq, which has acknowledged using chemical weapons in its war against Iran, denies that it has done the same with the Kurds. But the State Department in Washington says it is convinced that such weapons were used and it has condemned the action as ''abhorrent and unjustifiable.'' In Congress and elsewhere, the Iraqi attacks have been denounced as genocide, but the Reagan Administration has stopped short of using the term.  [ In Baghdad, Iraq angrily criticized Congress for accusing it of using chemical weapons against the Kurds. The ruling Baath Party called for large demonstrations against the United States and Israel. ]  Complicating matters is a statement by the Turkish Government, issued Friday, that said that its own examinations of Kurds in the makeshift camps had yielded no evidence to confirm the allegations. The statement was carefully worded. It did not absolutely deny the use of such weapons; it merely said that Turkey could not confirm it. **********Elaborating on the statement today, the Foreign Ministry official said the conclusion was based on the observations of Turkish medical teams. **********''We have thoroughly looked into it,'' he said. ''There were apparently also a few deaths of people who showed some signs of sickness, and there were autopsies on the bodies. The examination of them did not show any evidence of chemical weapons being used.'' **********Turkish physicians have made similar statements to journalists who visited the border in the first days of the Kurdish migration to Turkey. **********In addition, journalists who spoke to the refugees said that most seemed in reasonably good shape. Some reported that after listening to the Kurds' accounts they came away unconvinced, or at least uncertain. They said some of the accounts were confusing and lacking in detail and that some were second-hand accounts. Merely the rumor of poison-gas use is enough to prompt Kurds to flee. **********To an extent, the differing conclusions that have been drawn could hinge on a matter of happenstance. The various observers - journalists, diplomats, physicians and others - did not all go to the same refugee camps at the same time. **********A United States official in Ankara insisted today that observers at the scene had witnessed ''blistering, sores on hands, faces and feet'' that were consistent with chemical-related injuries. It is known that among the observers at the frontier was an official from the American Embassy here. Iraqi Motivations Questioned **********''Based on what I saw I'm not surprised that the State Department came to that conclusion,'' a Western diplomat said. Another diplomat agreed, but said, ''It is hard to lay your hands on evidence that would stand up in court.'' **********In evaluating the discrepancies between the American and Turkish conclusions, some foreign analysts said that differing motivations could be a factor. ''Officials are likely to be less candid than earlier,'' one Western diplomat said. **********The unstated implication in that remark seemed to be that Turkey might have reasons, not to lie, but perhaps to avoid an aggressive pursuit of poison-gas allegations. Notably, it is concerned about relations with neighboring Iraq, an oil supplier; relations between the two countries have already been damaged by Turkey's willingness to accept the Kurds and to deny Iraqi forces the right of ''hot pursuit'' of rebels across the frontier. **********The Foreign Ministry official acknowledged that there may be trouble ahead with Iraq, but he insisted that Turkey's main consideration was providing humanitarian assistance to the refugees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/26/business/maneuvering-on-trade-bill-intensifies.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1988-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 782, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maneuvering On Trade Bill Intensifies", "print_headline": "Maneuvering On Trade Bill Intensifies", "body_text": " **********Administration officials asserted today that the Senate would not pass trade legislation with enough votes to override a veto. But the Democratic leadership continued to hunt for support, putting pressure on oil-state Republicans. **********As the political maneuvering continued, one Administration official said, ''We've worked the vote very hard.'' For example, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d went to Capitol Hill this morning to lobby individual senators. **********The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday or Wednesday. The House of Representatives, which approved the bill on Thursday by 312 to 107, is expected to override a veto. **********If the bill is vetoed and cannot be overridden in the Senate, the Democratic leadership is expected to introduce new trade legislation. And the Democrats warned today that the Administration might lose some of its most sought-after trade provisions, including repeal of the ''windfall profits'' oil tax. **********The trade bill, which was more than two and a half years in the making, has a bitterly contested requirement that companies provide 60 days' notice of plant closings or layoffs. **********President Reagan has said he will veto the bill because it contains the plant-closing provision, which the business community opposes as an unwarranted intrusion in corporate affairs. The Democratic leadership and organized labor say the measure would provide essential assistance to workers facing brutal changes. **********The Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, served notice today that any new trade bill might not terminate the eight-year-old windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil. The oil industry in economically depressed states regards that measure as Public Enemy No. 1. The windfall is described as the excess of the selling price over the base price established for three different types of oil. Because prices have fallen so sharply since 1980, by more than 50 percent, the tax now yields no revenues to the Treasury. **********Mr. Byrd's remarks were intended to win votes from oil-state Republicans. Such support could help the Democrats put together the two-thirds majority for a veto override. **********So anxious are oil executives for repeal of the profits tax that their principal lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, has broken with other business organizations and is actively working for passage of the bill in its current form. **********But the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the bill would be stopped because ''we do have veto strength.'' **********Of the 54 Democrats in the Senate only one, William Proxmire of Wisconsin, who is retiring after this year, has said he will oppose the bill. He is upset because it would soften the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, which subjects corporate officials to penalties if their subordinates bribe foreign officials. Senator Proxmire was chiefly responsible for that law. **********If 53 Democrats vote for the bill, 14 Republicans would be needed to provide the votes for an override. John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Senate trade subcommittee, will provide one vote. **********''This is not some fly-by-night bill,'' said Senator Danforth, who helped shape some of the main provisions. ''It is major legislation. I wish the President would sign the bill even with plant-closing on it. He will not do so. There is no doubt about that. He is going to veto the legislation.'' **********Republicans from farm states, which stand to benefit from the large export subsidies in the legislation, may also be tempted to join the Democrats. **********Two weeks ago, the White House and Democratic leaders were close to an agreement on the trade bill that would have dropped the plant-closing provision. The agreement collapsed, an Administration official said, because the announcement of trade figures showed that the trade deficit had widened to $13.8 billion in February from $12.4 billion in January. **********''The trade numbers had just come out, and the Democratic leadership indicated they thought the trade numbers were going to make a difference with their people,'' the official added. Drawbacks Stressed **********Both Administration and business officials argue that the plant-closing provision will hurt small business, cause a proliferation of litigation, put companies at a competitive disadvantage and lead to intrusions in the collective bargaining process. **********There are 42,000 manufacturing companies that employ more than 100 workers. Half of these employ fewer than 300 workers.

Every week, someone arrives with thousands of dollars for local families. Every two or three weeks, another dozen or so migrants say tearful adieus and head for New York. **********For the United States, of course, the migration is illegal, yet for Caraguatay and nearby peasant communities 60 miles east of Asuncion, the escape to New York has become so institutionalized that young people are now expected to give good reason for not wanting to go. At least 3,000 of the 15,000 people living in this area have already gone. **********''Caraguatay is the pioneer of migration to the United States,'' said Gabriel Saguier, who runs a local pharmacy and has a cousin working in a bar in New York. ''It all started here almost 20 years ago. Now other communities come and ask us how it's done. There are now 200,000 Paraguayans living in the United States.''  [ American census and immigration figures indicate that perhaps 4,000 Paraguayans live in the United States legally. ]  A Town Made Prosperous The incentive to go is clear. Thanks to money sent by relatives in New York, Caraguatay is the most prosperous town in this generally depressed region of southern Paraguay. **********''We have better houses, better business and better fiestas,'' said Ordener Cataldo, the police commissioner. ''Where people have gone to the United States, everything is better.'' **********Even charity comes in the form of dollars. The Roman Catholic Church has a new roof and new paint after a $13,000 collection at the Caraguatay Social Center in Brooklyn. When the local ambulance broke down recently, a new one was provided by contributions from New York. **********So strong is the 6,000-mile link between this town and New York that both Bishop Demetrio Aquino of nearby Caacupe and the priest in Caraguatay, Juan Esteban Ruiz Diaz, have been sent to visit their former parishioners. And many of them return here for the town's annual Festival of Our Lady of Mercy on Sept. 24. **********For those who stay behind, the dream is that if they cannot migrate, at least their children will. ''Parents are so proud when their children go,'' Mr. Cataldo said. ''They don't worry that it's illegal because, as soon as their children get there, they call up and say they're fine. They go poor, and two years later they come back with gold watches and buy cars and have parties.'' Current Fee Is $4,500 **********Many parents even sell off cattle or a cart to help cover the current $4,500 fee charged by skilled smugglers to deliver a migrant in New York. In other cases, travel agencies finance the cost, being reimbursed at high interest rates from wage packets subsequently earned in New York. **********Standing outside her home on Caraguatay's main plaza, Mercedes Gonzalez Rodriguez said she dreamed of joining her brother, Jose, in New York. **********''He's washing dishes somewhere,'' she said. ''He said it's very cold, but even if he's not too happy, he's earning in dollars. If I can, I'm going to leave my three children with my mother and go.'' **********Two women, Marta Leguizamon and Maximina Franco, who both now live in New York but return here once a year, are credited with initiating the flow, and to many townsfolk, they still hold the key to migration. ''Parents take them presents of food to try to persuade them to take their children,'' Mr. Saguier said. **********When the underground route was first opened up, mainly young girls, some as young as 14 years old, were taken to the United States to work as domestic servants. According to United States officials, some of the girls ended up working as prostitutes to pay off the smugglers. But today there are as many men as women among the migrants. Some Enter as Tourists **********Local residents say that in the past many potential migrants would be specially trained and dressed to persuade American consular officials in Asuncion to give them visas to vacation in the United States. Once in Miami, staying in a hotel known for its Paraguayan clientele, they would then leave tourist groups and continue on to New York. **********Now, however, with consular officials on the alert for anyone coming from Caraguatay, almost all the migration is done clandestinely, usually through Mexico, although more recently also through Argentina. **********Perhaps because most local people are peasant farmers unaccustomed to dealing with banks, money sent down here is usually brought in cash by visitors, in some cases as much as $30,000 at a time. ''They bring the money hidden where they can,'' Mr. Cataldo said. ''In their socks, in their clothes, wherever. But it always seems to get here.'' **********Not everyone is pleased by the exodus. Sister Daria Bernal, a nun who runs one of two local schools, said her student population fell from 400 in 1985 to 350 last year. **********The tradition, though, is so much part of Caraguatay's way of life that, notwithstanding new immigration laws in the United States, it seems likely to continue. **********''When they leave, they all say their idea is to earn money and return here,'' Mr. Saguier said. ''But once they are there, they say, 'What am I going to do in Caraguatay?' I don't know anyone who has come back to stay.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/world/shiite-militia-routs-its-pro-iran-rival-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1988-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shiite Militia Routs Its Pro-Iran Rival in Lebanon", "print_headline": "Shiite Militia Routs Its Pro-Iran Rival in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********Lebanon's main Shiite Moslem militia said today that it had gained total control of the largest Shiite town in southern Lebanon after routing the Party of God, a pro-Iranian group, in three days of large-scale fighting. **********A spokesman for the militia, Amal, said Party of God gunmen had been driven out of their last strongholds in the town, Nabatiye, after 15 of them had been taken prisoner. **********The police said that 8 people were killed and 20 wounded today.

This was the Tucker - a new car concept that set the stage for Preston T. Tucker's entrance onto the automotive scene. **********Earlier that year The New York Times reported, ''The 'Torpedo' Car Is Expected to Make Debut Next Year.'' The article was accompanied by a photograph of what appeared to be a very unusual full-sized car - this too was a Tucker, although it was different from the one pictured in Science Illustrated. In neither article was there a mention of the actual designers of the automobile: George Lawson, in 1946, and Alex S. Tremulis who, in 1947, was the Tucker Corporation's chief stylist. Not only was there no mention of the designers, there were not even any cars: The pictures in Science Illustrated were carefully drawn renderings and the photo given to The New York Times was actually of a one-quarter size clay model photographed against a realistic background. **********It was not until March 1947 that Mr. Tucker had a factory in which to make his dream automobile. At the time, the factory was the largest on earth, the former Dodge plant in Chicago, which had made B-29 engines during World War II. **********But even at this time, Mr. Tucker and his backers did not feel that they had the final design. According to J. Gordon Lippincott of Lippincott & Margulies, a corporate design and image consulting firm, ''Tucker gave me a ring on the phone and said that he wanted to come up and talk to me about styling an automobile - as fast as possible.'' **********Mr. Tucker and Mr. Lippincott agreed on terms and in March 1947, Mr. Lippincott dispatched five designers to Chicago - Hal Bergstrom, Tucker Madawick, Budd Steinhilber, Read Viemeister and myself. Our job was to generate design proposals for the 1948 Tucker in concert with Mr. Tremulis. In two months of concentrated effort, our team raced to build a full-sized clay model alongside another being built by Mr. Tremulis and his team. **********When our design team first met with Tucker it proved to be a mesmerizing experience as he described his dream car. A highlight of his presention to us was the engine. According to Mr. Tucker, the engine would be huge and slow turning, capable of ''driving a full-sized car at 50 miles per hour at 500 revolutions per minute.'' The typical engine of the time turned at nearly 2,000 revolutions per minute at 50 m.p.h. The meeting lasted for several hours and Mr. Tucker spoke without let-up. He was quietly persuasive and charming and his eloquence was punctuated with malapropisms. For instance, he called the gas pedal the 'exhilerator' instead of the accelerator. **********But Mr. Tucker was still faced with a chorus of ''nays'' about his big engine from the test drivers and engineers who struggled to make the slow turning, technologically backward, engine work. **********Finally Mr. Tucker gave up on his lumbering 500-cubic-inch engine. A group, which included his son, found a substitute - a helicopter engine made by Aircooled Motors Inc. in Syracuse, N.Y. The group converted the engine to liquid cooling and fitted it with a gear box from a 1936 Cord automobile. So much for the dream of a fully hydraulic drive train. **********The first 25 of these engines, complete with tooling, cost $5,000 each. With some creative financing, after Mr. Tucker bought Aircooled Motors, the cost was down to $1,500 an engine. But the price of the engine was still as much as the car was supposed to sell for. Plans were on the drawing board for a less expensive version of the engine, which was never made. **********One of Mr. Tucker's very positive concerns was related to autombile safety in a crash. There was to be no dashboard to smash against for a passenger in the right front seat. He insisted that his cars have crash padding and pop-out windshields. Oddly, he did not require seat belts. **********But Mr. Tucker's concern for safety was not inclusive. For example, I designed an energy-absorbing steering wheel that Mr. Tucker did not approve. Instead, Mr. Tucker had another wheel designed to his specifications. **********Mr. Tucker's steering wheel was based on a design being used in the Cadillac and it had a very unsafe, protruding, center-of-the-wheel hub. **********But the wheel was not produced in time to be installed in a pilot run of 1948 Tuckers. Instead, all Tuckers were equipped with Lincoln Zephyr steering wheels, a last-minute gift from the Ford Motor Company. **********The pilot run of 50 cars began in the spring of 1948, with the helicopter engine and excellent body stampings from dies made by eight Detroit tool and die shops. Fifty sets of stampings had been ordered; not even a drop in the bucket for an automotive start-up. Why only 50? Rumors ran rampant that Mr. Tucker's cash was running low. Then came a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation with a subpoena of the company books. Mr. Tucker closed the plant, feeling that operations could not continue without records. **********Thirty-seven pilot-production 1948 Tuckers were produced. In my opinion, they were excellent cars, although they did not have all of the features that Mr. Tucker envisioned for his dream car. An additional 14 cars were assembled by volunteers when Mr. Tucker and his seven co-defendants were tried on 31 counts of mail fraud, violations of S.E.C. regulations and conspiracy. **********All of the defendants were exonerated, but Mr. Tucker's money- raising potential was wiped out. He had raised about $25 million and needed much more. Henry J. Kaiser, the World War II shipbuilding executive, started to manufacture autombiles in 1945 with $52 million of capital. After nearly 10 years of struggle, Mr. Kaiser left the auto business, unable to capture enough market share. He later said that he should have had at least $200 million for his start-up. **********Preston Tucker was a dreamer, he had courage, conviction and an idea. I thought him to be utterly sincere; a true believer in what he promised. But the $25 million in start-up capital he raised was only a down payment - even in 1948 - on what proved to be a very expensive dream."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/06/business/german-backs-dollar-level.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 412, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Backs Dollar Level", "print_headline": "German Backs Dollar Level", "body_text": " **********In the clearest sign of the intentions of the major industrial countries for the recently tumbling dollar, West Germany's Finance Minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, said today that the current exchange rate was acceptable. **********Mr. Stoltenberg's remarks imply that, to the extent the governments can control currencies, they are committed to keeping the dollar stable for some time to come at the slightly higher levels it has reached since the end of last year. **********Lately, the dollar has been trading at close to 1.70 German marks, only half the peak of three years ago but slightly higher than the 1.60-mark range of late last year.

Together, the two Kims received 55 percent of the vote, while the winner, Roh Tae Woo, won with 36.6 percent.

''This could lead to the re-unification of the opposition party for the parliamentary elections.''

''This could be a tactic, it could be real, but these things take on a life of their own.'' **********South Korea's opposition, which appeared to triumph last June when demonstrations forced the Government to agree to direct presidential elections, remains rocked by its election defeat. Several younger opposition leaders have rejected both parties, blaming the two Kims for placing their personal ambitions above opposition unity and calling on them to step aside. **********Even so, Mr. Kim's move today was unexpected and surprised even some of his aides, the diplomat said.

But in the Soviet Union, land of scientific materialism, Dzhuna has a state business license, an honored spot on the Soviet Peace Committee, and a coterie of friends that includes scientists, artists, journalists and intellectuals. 'Our Secret Silliness' **********Horoscopes, folk medicine, psychic healing and all manner of mysticism occupy a prominent place in Soviet society, part faith, part fad, but no joke. **********''It is our secret silliness,'' said the wife of a Government official, who admits that as soon as Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Soviet leader, the first thing she did was look up his sign. He is a Pisces. **********''Leave Nancy Reagan alone,'' the woman admonished. **********Except in the unlikely event that some Kremlin Donald T. Regan writes a tell-all book, it may never be known whether astral omens guide affairs of state here, as Mr. Regan, the former White House chief of staff, says has sometimes been the case in the Reagan family. **********Dzhuna, who prefers to go by the first name she gave herself when Yevgenia seemed inadequate to her gift, reputedly was summoned to the bedside of Leonid I. Brezhnev when the ailing Soviet leader was slipping beyond the help of conventional medicine. Dzhuna carefully does not deny this report, but says her ''Hippocratic oath'' forbids a direct answer. **********If you must know, however, she will confide that ''Leonid Ilyich told the Minister of Health the country should build me a whole clinic.'' **********Whatever Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, make of the occult sciences, his constituents seem to feel they explain at least as much about life as Marx and Lenin ever did.

He said he was delighted to hear on a Voice of America radio broadcast that Mrs. Reagan shared his interest in the subject, although recently he has laid aside astrology in favor of a newer passion, collecting films of Broadway musicals. **********The affection for what Mrs. Reagan's ridiculers would call superstition extends to fortunetelling and folk medicines. Young Muscovites still hop the electric trains to towns outside the capital where fortunetellers read palms or tarot cards. **********Many a Russian grandmother is a textbook on folk remedies that can be made from vodka, garlic or potatoes. A Western scholar who visited Moscow in 1986 was instructed in the art of ''banki,'' hot cupping glasses applied to the skin in the belief that the suction improves blood circulation. **********Although astrology is officially frowned upon in the Soviet Encyclopedia as a ''false science,'' scholarly works have been devoted to such subjects as the healing properties of mumiyo, a tarlike resin collected from the places wounded animals go to die. **********Parapsychology is accorded serious discussion in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. When Soviet newspapers or television feature practitioners like Dzhuna, as the hip late-night program ''Vzglyad'' did recently, there is nary a hint of smugness. **********Dzhuna, who works two blocks from the American diplomatic residence where the Reagans will sleep during the summit meeting at the end of May, is perhaps Moscow's reigning queen of the occult sciences. **********She is also a painter. A dozen of her self-portraits in oil gaze down with enlarged green eyes from the walls of her clinic, and scores more are stacked upstairs in her plush apartment. An Accomplished Presence **********She is a published poet, a recorded singer, and a presence, with high Georgian cheekbones and a nimbus of stylishly tousled jet-black hair. She gives her age as 38. Dressed in her healing clothes - a short black skirt, black stockings, black blouse, yellow silk vest and a cascade of jewelry - she brings to mind Cher in ''The Witches of Eastwick.'' **********Her healing sessions are free, but she charges 360 rubles (about $600) a student to teach her skills, and maintains that 150 disciples have been trained to administer ''Effect D.'' **********Although she is skeptical of classical astrology - something about the earth's orbit being out of whack -she says she takes her own readings of the stars. Naturally she has looked ahead to the summit, and her forecast is bright. **********''Just see what kind of friendship will blossom between Reagan and Gorbachev,'' she predicted.

Growing Skepticism **********Diplomats say this sense has fueled a widespread mistrust of the Government and of the apparent concessions it is making in the face of broad-based, nationwide protests. **********On the streets of Rangoon, the diplomats find a suspicion among the Burmese that such moves are little more than maneuvers by the men who have manipulated them for so many years. **********''Whatever changes they announce, it all means nothing as long as Ne Win is still there,'' said a diplomat in describing the prevailing attitude. Large Protests Continue **********Underscoring this attitude, hundreds of thousands of people once again marched in the streets of the capital today to reject the Government's offer of the multiparty election the protesters had demanded. **********Three opposition figures who have not always agreed in the past issued a joint statement insisting that fair elections could only be held under the supervision of a neutral interim government. **********''The people have the feeling that their Government has tricked them for too long,'' a diplomat said. ''They don't see these as concessions but as traps.'' **********One of the few outsiders who has met the current Burmese leader, U Maung Maung, was the Democratic Representative from New York, Stephen J. Solarz. He said his visit last week convinced him that Mr. Ne Win ''continues to call the shots.'' **********''Virtually everybody I spoke to said he was not managing day to day affairs, but there was the sense that no decision may be made without his consent,'' Mr. Solarz said. **********Unlike the final days of Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines, neither Mr. Solarz nor, so far as is known, any other foreign official, has met with Mr. Ne Win in his time of crisis. **********Because of this, Mr. Ne Win has isolated himself from the international pressure that contributed to the departures of men like Mr. Marcos when their populations turned against them. **********Without such pressures, diplomats and other Burma-watchers say they believe that Mr. Ne Win will seek to continue to exercise power through the small group that has surrounded him since before his resignation. Case of Sein Lwin **********At the top of this group, they say, is U Sein Lwin, the former general who was Mr. Ne Win's sergeant-major and aide in the postwar Fourth Burma Rifles that formed his initial power base. **********The closeness of the two men, between whom there is said to be a father-son relationship, indicates that Mr. Sein Lwin was selected as a surrogate when he succeeded Mr. Ne Win as party leader and President in July, the diplomats said. **********But his reputation as the man who carried out brutal suppression of student protests on behalf of Mr. Ne Win aroused anger, and he was forced by continuing demonstrations to resign after just 17 days in office. **********His selection is seen by some diplomats as the first of a series of blunders that demonstrate that if Mr. Ne Win is indeed, as Mr. Solarz said, calling the shots, he is seriously misreading the national mood. **********Mr. Sein Lwin was replaced by Mr. Maung Maung, one of two civilians in the Cabinet, in what may have been an attempt to mollify the protesters. **********But diplomats said his image as an honorable man and a moderate were apparently not enough to overcome public rejection of him as a member of Mr. Ne Win's inner circle. ''As long as the people think Ne Win is still there, none of his front men are going to be acceptable,'' a diplomat said. Loyalty Is Said to Pay **********Mr. Ne Win has assured the loyalty of men like these over the decades by bonds of gratitude and by outright payments of large sums of money, which are said to have been deposited in Swiss bank accounts, according to diplomats and Burmese exiles here. **********He is also said to have provided for himself and his family - he has married seven times, twice to the same woman - with property in Austria and West Germany and Swiss bank accounts. **********The many stories Burmese tell about Mr. Ne Win include the assertion that he has first picks of the pearls, emeralds and rubies at the annual gem auction in Rangoon. **********Though the extent of his wealth is not known, some Burmese say, probably with a good measure of exaggeration, that he could singlehandedly pay off the national debt of $4.4 billion. **********During a general strike and protest earlier this month, officials of the Foreign Trade Bank said his associates were trying to withdraw a sum variously put at $3 million and $6 million. **********While assuring the loyalty of the men around him, Mr. Ne Win has methodically removed any of his associates who might have become a threat to him. Two such men, U Aung Gyi, a former brigadier, and U Tin Oo, a former Defense Minister, are now leaders of the opposition. **********Mr. Ne Win has similarly assured the vital loyalty of the top ranks of the military, experts on Burma said. **********''The top commanders in the army are all like Ne Win's children,'' said Bertil Lintner, a Bangkok-based Swedish journalist who is an expert on Burma. ''He has fed them and raised them since they were young.'' Seen as Father Figure **********In the population at large, one Burmese exile said, Mr. Ne Win is seen as a godfather, but a capricious and frightening one. ''Even though he is so awful, he is our father and we must respect him,'' the exile said. **********Mr. Ne Win has relinquished formal power before with no apparent diminishing of his authority, when he gave up the Presidency but retained the chairmanship of the single party in 1981. **********His warning to his colleagues then might apply today: ''Though I will not be in the Parliament or the Council of State, I shall be watching from the party and when I give advice where needed, do things with discretion. I shall continue to do things, but all those who would be directly concerned with the practical aspects of the work should exercise utmost caution.'' **********The prevailing analysis of Mr. Ne Win's resignation from the party leadership in July is now that he saw the coming Burmese crisis and hoped to deal with it from behind the scenes in a way that would preserve his good name for history."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/30/world/limits-to-our-patience-us-cautions-noriega.html": {"writer_name": "Neil Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'Limits to Our Patience,' U.S. Cautions Noriega", "print_headline": "'Limits to Our Patience,' U.S. Cautions Noriega", "body_text": " **********A White House spokesman expressed outrage today over the violence against opposition figures and American reporters in Panama, and he warned that ''there are limits to our patience.'' **********The comments by the spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came as Panamanian opposition leaders, including the man who the Reagan Administration says remains the nation's lawful president, invited the United States to send in troops to arrest or overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military leader. **********Mr. Fitzwater said that while the United States has declared it does not intend to use military force, American officials were greatly angered over the incident Monday in which several American reporters were roughed up and opposition figures were detained. **********''It has always been a principle that we will protect American citizens as best we can,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.

Mr. Delvalle, who is said by his associates to be in hiding inside Panama, was dismissed by legislators loyal to Mr. Noriega after he tried unsuccessfully to fire the military leader. Clampdown on Deposits, Fees **********The Administration has relied on its contention that Mr. Delvalle is the real President as legal justification for a strategy of freezing Panamanian assets in the United States. Citing a proclamation issued by Mr. Delvalle that no money should be paid by creditors to the Noriega-controlled Government, the State Department has advised New York banks to freeze Panamanian Government accounts. Similarly, the United States has not paid the Noriega-controlled authorities nearly $7 million due earlier this month from Panama Canal fees. **********A call to use force to oust Mr. Noriega was made today by Juan B. Sosa, the Panamanian Ambassador to Washington who remains loyal to Mr. Delvalle. Mr. Sosa said that on Wednesday morning he would formally ask the Administration in the name of Mr. Delvalle that it consider ''any action'' to insure the general's departure. **********Mr. Sosa advocated ''a commando-type of operation to arrest him, which would probably be the best alternative and would avoid confrontation and loss of life.'' **********Although Administration officials said that military action in Panama was a last resort, Pentagon officials noted tonight that the amphibious ship Okinawa, with 700 Marines aboard, had passed through the Panama Canal today and was due to remain in the region for several days. **********The ship, which had been operating in the Persian Gulf as a base for helicopters, was returning to home port in San Diego after a round-the-world cruise that included three months in the gulf, the officials said. The United States already has about 10,500 troops in Panama. **********Mr. Noriega has been indicted by two Federal grand juries in Florida on charges involving drug-trafficking, and American officials have said that they would prosecute him if he could be arrested. 'Legitimate Cry for Help' **********One American official today said that a call from Mr. Delvalle to arrest General Noriega ''was a legitimate cry for help'' from the proper government. But the official, who asked not to be identified by name, conceded that the United States did not have to comply with the request any more than it was required to fulfill other requests from legal governments. **********The official attributed the call to increasing frustration among the Noriega opponents. ''We've all been guilty of raising expectations as to how long this is going to take,'' he said. Still, ''the opposition shouldn't sell themselves short so soon and ask for American help. It's too early for that.'' **********Administration officials said that military intervention would probably be considered only in the event of threats to American citizens or to the Panama Canal.

The test could help aid in efforts to slow the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users - the group in which the virus is spreading the fastest. Results in 5 Minutes **********Gerald F. Buck, chairman and chief executive of the Cambridge Bioscience Corporation, based in Worcester, Mass., said his company's test, marketed under the brand name Recombigen, produces results in five minutes. It will ''make it possible to diagnose high-risk patients in the privacy of the physician's office, with appropriate counseling,'' he said. **********Cambridge Bioscience said it expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve the test by the end of the year. **********In the Cambridge test, a drop of blood taken from a finger is applied to tiny latex beads coated with genetically engineered protein from an outer layer of the HIV virus. The blood of those infected usually contains antibodies, or substances produced by the immune system to fight the virus. The antibodies attach to the protein fragments on the latex beads, causing the beads to clump together in a manner visible with a microscope. **********Several other rapid tests are in development and may be approved for general use in the United States within a year, said Dr. Thomas C. Quinn, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. **********The Du Pont Company has marketed its own fast test, known as Hivchek, outside the United States since March. It takes about 10 minutes and requires the use of a centrifuge, which is available in most labs, to break the blood down into serum. A spokesman for Abbott Laboratories said his company has a rapid test in development. Size of Market Unclear **********The size of the market for the new test is unclear, in part because of controversy about whether screening for AIDS should be practiced widely by employers and hospitals. **********An estimated 1.5 million Americans are thought to be infected with the HIV virus, and at least 73,000 AIDS cases have been diagnosed in the United States. Of these, more than 30,000 patients have died. **********''Any new inexpensive, accurate method of determining HIV positive or negative is a welcome addition,'' said Dr. David E. Rogers, chairman of the advisory council of the New York State AIDS Institute. ''But there is disagreement about what groups should be tested.'' **********Dr. Quinn, who is also an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said the Cambridge test requires the expertise of a trained technician and is not meant for home use. **********''Even if the test comes up positive, it should be confirmed by another test before a definitive diagnosis of HIV,'' he added. Confirmation is recommended for current HIV tests as well. 'Breakthrough' in 2 Ways **********The Cambridge test ''represents a breakthrough both in diagnostic technology for HIV infection, and as the first test that uses recombinant technology,'' Dr. Quinn said, referring to genetic engineering. **********He was one of a group of American and African scientists who supervised trials of the test in Kinshasa, Zaire. In recent articles in The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association and The Journal of Clinical Microbiology, they said the accuracy of the fast test was within four-tenths of 1 percent of tests now in use. **********Rapid tests have already been used in undeveloped countries like Haiti, Zaire, Trinidad and Uganda, that in many localities lack the the money sophisticated equipment, and the refrigeration needed for the Elisa test, which is widely used in Europe and the United States. Elisa is short for ''enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.'' **********Elisa results are usually not available for several hours in a hospital and may take up to two weeks to get back to doctors from outside labs. **********The fast test may also be used in medical emergency rooms, in dealing with profusely bleeding patients; at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, and in methadone clinics and other centers for IV drug users. In clinics, Dr. Quinn said, current tests are ''frequently very frustrating, because the patient does not come back for the result and you cannot provide counseling at the time of their visit.'' Patients to Pay $20 to $40 **********The Cambridge test is expected to cost doctors $2 to $10 and the patient $20 to $40, said Teena L. Lerner, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Those costs are about the same as the Elisa test. **********Analysts said commercialization of the Cambridge test could give the biotechnology company an advantage in developing related products. Shares in Cambridge Bioscience closed at $13.25 on Friday, down 37.5 cents in over-the-counter trading. Earlier this year the stock traded as low as $6. **********Mr. Buck said Cambridge Bioscience holds patents on genetically engineered proteins and a process to purify them. He said the company also has an exclusive license from Harvard to a process that may be useful in the creation of a vaccine. Licensing the Technology **********''The AIDS-testing market will be growing dramatically,'' said Ms. Lerner of Shearson. She said Cambridge had licensed its test technology to Baxter International Inc. and the Syntex Corporation. **********''We estimate Cambridge will see about 25 percent of net sales for the test and generate earnings per share of 20 to 30 cents next year,'' said Jeffrey R. Swarz of Goldman, Sachs. **********''The crucial issue is whether they can develop an untried series of markets in the United States before facing competition from Du Pont and Abbott,'' said Sarah Gordon, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/finance-briefs-897688.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Air Products and Chemicals Inc. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to $100 million of medium-term notes to be issued from time to time. *********** McDonald Corp. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to $200 million of debt securities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/30/world/15-year-old-palestinian-dies-in-clash-with-israeli-troops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "15-Year-Old Palestinian Dies In Clash With Israeli Troops", "print_headline": "15-Year-Old Palestinian Dies In Clash With Israeli Troops", "body_text": " **********Israeli troops killed a 15-year-old Palestinian today and the police fired tear gas at Arab schoolgirls protesting peacefully outside the United States Consulate in East Jerusalem, witnesses said. **********The Palestinian who was slain, Ibrahim Ghassan Aranka, was shot during a clash in Tayiba in the West Bank, hospital officials here said.

But the art galleries, boutiques and restaurants that have been established in the neighborhood in recent years are helping to make the area more attractive, and young families and professionals are moving in. **********To help keep costs affordable, some developers are structuring the prices of new apartments so that, once a down payment has been made, the monthly mortgage and maintenance costs are equal to what the apartment would cost as a rental. **********In a 30-unit co-op project that Ronald Moelis and a partner, Sanford Loewentheil, are completing at 97-99-101 Avenue B near Seventh Street, prices average $250 a square foot. **********That is considerably less than the average cost of $400 a square foot in new buildings in more established Manhattan neighborhoods. **********A one-bedroom, 580-square-foot apartment in the building sells for $140,000. It costs the buyer $1,170 a month for the first year for mortgage and maintenance payments, including taxes. That assumes a 25 percent down payment of $35,000 and a 30-year, 9 percent variable-rate mortgage. The same apartment would cost about $1,150 monthly to rent. The pricing structure is attracting investors as well as owner-occupants. **********''People want to get away from the Upper East Side and the new 40-story high rise on each block,'' said Mr. Moelis, who has sold half of the apartments since sales began in January. ''Here, living is cheaper and much more informal.'' **********The two partners, who operate under the name L&M; Equity Participants, purchased their first buildings in the area four years ago. They gutted the four structures at 214-216 Avenue A near 14th Street, creating 18 apartments and three stores. **********At the Avenue B project, called Tompkins Court, a $1.9 million renovation of two six-story former tenement buildings has yielded 30 apartments and 2,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. An elevator has been installed. **********The stores are under condominium ownership, but the residential space is being sold as shares in a cooperative. This legal arrangement, called a ''condop'' plan, is frequently found in buildings that have a mix of residential and commercial space. **********Studios at Tompkins Court are selling for $75,000 to $89,000, and one-bedroom units are priced from $139,000 to $209,000. The two-bedroom, two-bath apartments sell for $239,000 to $329,000. Monthly maintenance ranges from $259 to $609. **********Some flavor of the original turn-of-the-century structures has been retained with 10-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls and oak flooring. **********There will be a small exercise room and a sauna in the basement, as well as laundry facilities, and residents will also have the use of a roof deck. The top-floor apartments have roof rights - private ownership of the roof above each unit - and most have one or two skylights. **********Michael Rakosi and Bruce Manka are two other developers active in the area. Their first venture was the rehabilitation of a six-story building at 613 East Sixth Street near Avenue B, which was gutted and rebuilt as 14 two-bedroom apartments in 1986. Their present project, Hearth House, is at 50 Avenue A near Third Street. **********The building, which once housed a furniture store, was gutted and two floors were added. It now contains 17 co-op apartments and 4,800 square feet of commercial space. The European American Bank, which financed the project, has rented 2,500 square feet. Contracts have been signed on only two apartments since sales began in December, possibly because the prices, $235,200 to $497,800, are higher than most others in the area. **********Most apartments have balconies or roof terraces, and some feature greenhouses. All have two bedrooms and two baths and a fireplace. Some are duplexes and some triplexes. Each unit has a washer and a dryer.  To keep costs competitive, the sponsors are including incentives in the offering plan. Maintenance, including taxes, is free for five years, for instance. Five-year sponsor financing with payments of interest only is also available. **********With sponsor financing, as an example, the 1,200 square-foot Apartment 4B, which has a terrace and a balcony, would cost $2,236 a month for the first year and $2,689 monthly for the rest of the first five years. A 10 percent down payment would be needed on the $377,430 purchase price.

And he rarely holds cash or short-term securities, in any of the five mutual funds he manages. **********INVESTORS find themselves in some strange places these days. G. Kenneth Heebner, who invests $2 billion in mutual fund and pension assets at Loomis, Sayles & Co. in Boston, for example, usually buys growth stocks. And he rarely holds cash or short-term securities, in any of the five mutual funds he manages. **********Now, for the first time in his career, the 47-year-old money manager owns shares in industrial companies like steels and chemicals. And he has almost 30 percent of his funds set aside in either cash or Government bonds. After a bull market that has run since the mid-1970's, he is nervous about stock prices, he said. **********''My job this year is to preserve the clients' capital,'' he said. ''Sure I want to make money. But where you've had a 13-year bull market, shareholders have benefited and there's some uncertainty out there, I say 'Why try to be a hero?' '' **********Mr. Heebner's views carry some weight. After all, one of his funds, the Loomis-Sayles Capital Development Fund, is the second-best-performing mutual fund over the past 10-years, right behind the highly-successful Fidelity Magellan Fund. Last year, another fund he manages in a more aggressive fashion, the New England Capital Growth Fund, advanced in value 52.7 percent and was the fourth-best performer for the year. **********In recent weeks, Mr. Heebner has cut back his holdings in some stocks to raise cash or to buy 30-year Government bonds. Behind that move is a worry about the economy and its effect on stock prices. Since the October stock market collapse, consumers have retrenched and the economy is beginning to weaken, he believes. That could be good for long-term bond prices. **********Ordinarily, he added, the Federal Reserve Board could be counted on to stimulate a weak economy. But this time the Fed has additional concerns. Because the United States is so indebted to foreigners to finance the budget deficits, the Fed may be forced to keep interest rates high to attract their investments. ''I have some concern that the Federal Reserve has got some constraints on it,'' he said. **********He is avoiding shares of growth stocks - companies that investors think will report better-than-average earnings increases - because he believes these higher-priced stocks are more likely to fall if they do not meet investors' expectations. Because of the high price-earnings ratios of the stocks, investors are still looking for strong earnings from these companies. Overall, these stocks are more likely to fall in value than the shares of industrial companies that still have below-average price-earnings multiples, he said. ''We have a market here where that when something goes wrong you lose a lot of money,'' he said. **********Should the prices of growth stocks come down, however, he may step in and buy. ''Growth stocks are too expensive,'' he said. ''I will buy a growth stock only if I can get the right price.'' **********Essentially, Mr. Heebner thinks that the industrial side of the economy will be strong while the consumer and service sectors will weaken. He predicts a shakeout in retailing and cites cutbacks in banking, insurance and on Wall Street. ''We're going to be firing stockbrokers and putting them to work in steel factories,'' he joked. **********As a result of his confidence in the strength of the rust bowl, Mr. Heebner has almost 40 percent of his clients' funds invested in shares of steel, chemical and capital goods companies. In most cases, the p/e ratios of these companies are way below the average p/e ratio of the general stock market. Thus, they are unlikely to go much lower in price and they might surprise investors with better-than-expected earnings. That, he said, could ultimately attract other investors and drive their prices higher. **********Mr. Heebner likes the shares of industrial companies for reasons other than price, though. The cost cutting moves of the past five years and the weakened dollar have made these companies competitive with industrial companies in Japan and Europe for the first time in years. **********Mr. Heebner believes that these companies will experience some of the greatest profit increases in their history. Their costs, including unit labor costs, are either flat or stable at a time when the companies are raising prices. ''I see an explosion in profit margins,'' he said. **********Some of Mr. Heebner's biggest holdings are in shares of steel companies, like Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel and Armco. He has a relatively smaller position in Lukens Steel. He is looking for Bethlehem to earn almost $7 a share this year, up from what he calls ''negligible'' earnings in 1987. He thinks Inland could earn as much as $4.50 or $5 this year, up from $3 last year. **********Ford is another cyclical company that makes up a large part of his funds' assets. He describes it as one of the best-managed companies in the world and says that because of the weakened dollar it is becoming competitive with Japanese auto companies. Moreover, its stock is selling at a p/e of 4, or one-third that of the overall market. ''I'm paid to play,'' he joked. **********Other cyclical industry holdings in his funds include shares of capital goods, chemical and copper companies. His capital goods producers include Trinity Industries, which makes rail cars and Timken, which is the nation's largest manufacturer of ball bearings. His largest positions in chemical companies are Georgia Gulf and Quantum Chemical, the company that was formerly National Distillers. **********WHILE he still owns some copper stocks, Mr. Heebner sold some of those shares to raise cash. He was worried because copper prices had dropped from $1.48 to $.99 a pound. ''The price of copper is weaker than it should be,'' he said. ''I saw that and said 'Maybe the market is telling me something.' '' **********That caution stems from his experiences as a fund manager. During the bear market of 1973-1974, he learned some valuable lessons, he said. When stocks went down 20 percent at first, he simply bought more thinking it was an opportunity to buy what he liked at cheaper prices. But to his dismay, he learned that the prices could go even lower. ''You've got to recognize that sometimes the market is smarter than you are,'' he said. **********As a result of those bear market experiences, he is willing to sit with the cash reserves he has raised. But he admits that it is ''an unnatural act'' for him. ''I'm known as a guy with a bullish bias,'' he said. ''But this is a year where I don't want to lose money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/25/business/dollar-rise-lifts-prices-of-us-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Demand Offsets Profit Taking **********Because of these positive factors, bond dealers reported unusually heavy demand for a Friday, and overseas buying accounted for much of their business.

As far as the market was concerned, the Fed has done all the tightening of credit it plans to for a long time.

Recovery efforts have been hesitant and confused, they contend, and the natural disaster has become a major political issue. **********For example, here in Mexico's third-largest city, where municipal elections are scheduled for Nov. 9, there is still no final, official accounting of casualties. Dozens of people are still missing, and newspapers are filled with advertisements placed by anxious relatives seeking their whereabouts.

The state government this week urged leaders of such communities to go to the nearest county seat to pick up relief supplies, omitting mention of any plans to deliver materiel anytime soon. **********To protest the slowness and inadequacy of official relief efforts, residents of some of the hardest-hit towns in the north have organized marches and sit-ins at municipal government offices. Private groups have also begun to act. Motorcycle clubs have ferried supplies to areas the Government has been unable to reach. **********For the Mexican Government, this popular response contains uncomfortable echoes of the situation that followed the 1985 earthquakes in Mexico City. A slow and confused official reaction then, accompanied by revelations of widespread violations of building codes, produced a storm of criticism directed against President Miguel de la Madrid that eventually forced a Cabinet change.

GUARIGLIA is a 45-year-old senior vice president at Ogilvy & Mather Direct who has said, ''I'll be an Ogilvy man until the day I die.'' But he's leaving. For a long time, Mr. Guariglia, a Brooklyn boy transplanted to Middletown, N.J., has had a profound desire to be part of campus life. To do something to help young people. **********He has been studying the help wanted ads in The New York Times. For three years he has subscribed to The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly trade paper, and all the while his own work in advertising was moving closer to the kind of work he was seeking amid ivied walls. **********First he was put in charge of personnel in addition to his duties in account management. Then it was personnel and training domestically, with training worldwide added before long. Finally recruiting was included. That meant visits to campuses. And, so he saw the ad placed by St. Bonaventure University, which was looking for a dean of enrollment management. That sounded right to him and apparently he sounded right to the Franciscan fathers who run the place because he'll be leaving 450 Park Avenue South at 30th Street on July 8 and heading for St. Bonaventure and a 600-acre campus that accommodates a student body of 2,600 men and women. It's in St. Bonaventure, N.Y., about an hour-and-a-half drive from Buffalo. **********Although it means quite a pay cut, and there have been quite a few tears over leaving friends of 18 years, Mr. Guariglia couldn't be more enthusiastic about his second career. **********He said, ''I don't want to suddenly be 65 saying: 'I should have. I could have. I should have done what I was made to do.' '' **********He has visited the school and has done some deep thinking on its behalf, having already told its leadership that their problem is that they are in a share war with certain other colleges just as his clients are in share wars with their competitors. **********Mr. Guariglia has formulated a three-point marketing position for the university to present to prospective students directly or through their parents: ''We will challenge your mind. We will be there for you when you need us. We will prepare you for life and a successful career.'' **********Slightly different than what he has been doing of late at O.&M. Direct. In his office at O. & M. yesterday he explained that the agency had been able to fill its bottom-level personnel needs adequately from college grads who came looking. This year, however, the decision was made that perhaps the agency wasn't getting the best people that way. So he went to Boston University, Dartmouth, Holy Cross, Smith and William and Mary, seeking out liberal arts students ''who can write, speak, think critically and who can learn.'' **********The schools were selected, incidently, because some particularly good people at the agency are alumni. (Ogilvy & Mather, the parent company, only recruits M.B.A.'s.) Mr. Guariglia graduated in 1964 from Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., and soon after married a fellow Brooklynite, Eileen O'Flynn, currently a teacher at St. Catherine's parochial school near Middletown. After working for Lever Brothers as a salesman, he landed a job in the traffic department of Young & Rubicam, then served a two-year tour in the Army. **********Later he worked for six months with Abercrombie & Fitch as advertising manager under the fabled Schuyler Van Vechten, a former Y.&R. man himself. **********''Then,'' Mr. Guariglia said, ''I was hired by Ogilvy & Mather and my life changed forever.'' **********Now it is about to change again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/29/business/market-place-the-big-growth-in-machine-tools.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1988-06-29", "snippet": "LEAD: THIS week's report that machine-tool orders in May were the highest in seven years, and that orders in the first five months were up 82.6 percent from a year ago, has put the industry's two large publicly traded companies in a more favorable...", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;\nThe Big Growth In Machine Tools", "print_headline": "Market Place;\nThe Big Growth In Machine Tools", "body_text": " **********LEAD: THIS week's report that machine-tool orders in May were the highest in seven years, and that orders in the first five months were up 82.6 percent from a year ago, has put the industry's two large publicly traded companies in a more favorable light. **********THIS week's report that machine-tool orders in May were the highest in seven years, and that orders in the first five months were up 82.6 percent from a year ago, has put the industry's two large publicly traded companies in a more favorable light. **********Analysts say the stocks of Cincinnati Milacron and the Cross & Trecker Corporation, carry some risk but hold out the promise of substantial growth. Both companies make machines that cut and form metal. **********Machine-tool orders usually perk up late in an economic recovery. One of the reasons it took so long for new orders to develop this time, said John E. McGinty, an industry analyst in New York for the First Boston Corporation, is because the industry had accumulated huge inventories several years ago when Japanese machine-tool exporters rushed to increase shipments to the United States. They did so to raise their individual shares in their country's export quota, which began in 1985. **********''There was over a year's worth of unsold Japanese inventory in early 1986,'' Mr. McGinty said, adding that total machine-tool imports, including those from Taiwan and Europe, now account for about 30 percent of domestic consumption, down from more than half in 1986. **********Cincinnati Milacron is well placed to benefit from the current upturn because of a restructuring that permits it to react to the market more quickly, said David G. Sutliff, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''They won't get much bang out of this until late in the year and next year, because of the 18-month order cycle,'' he said. ''But I put it down as a strong buy in May on two bases. First, machine tools could perk up rather dramatically - which, in fact, has happened - and second, the company has realigned itself. And as the volume comes through, they could make a lot of money.'' **********Mr. Sutliff predicts that the company, which last year had a net loss of $80 million on revenues of $828 million, will increase its revenues by 6 percent in 1988 and earn $30 million, or about $1.20 a share. He expects it to earn $43 million on revenues of $960 million in 1989. **********Cincinnati Milacron sells to manufacturers of consumer goods, in particular the auto industry, and to military contractors. The company has also diversified into plastics, giving it a smoother flow of earnings throughout the economic cycle, said Ron Petrie, an analyst with McDonald & Company in Cleveland. ''They pay a 72-cent dividend, which is likely to be secure,'' he said. Mr. Petrie, who recommends the company's stock, forecasts earnings of $1.20 a share this year and of $2.25 a share next year. **********It takes 6 to 18 months to fill an order for a machine tool, and longer when the market is tight. The industry learned this to its detriment in 1979, when orders reached a record $5.5 billion after rising oil prices started an American stampede to retool to produce smaller, more energy-efficient cars, planes and appliances. **********Orders took two years and customers looked overseas for new suppliers. They quickly learned that Asian and European companies could deliver machine tools faster, cheaper and in configurations better suited to new, low-inventory manufacturing methods. **********With the rise in machine-tool imports and the 1981-82 recession, one-third of the domestic tool makers diappeared. Today there are only 350 companies in the industry, most of them small and privately owned. **********Mr. Petrie also considers Cross & Trecker a good buy even though it is less diversified than Cincinnati Milacron and its earnings are more cyclical. He said it had stopped paying a dividend, but was likely to reinstate one. **********For these stocks, Mr. Petrie said, growth is more important than income. ''The real issue is how sensitive this industry is going to be to a recession,'' he said. ''There is no way of knowing if a manufacturing renaissance will happen in this country; if it does, Cincinnati Milacron and Cross & Trecker will both appreciate quite a bit.'' **********He predicts that Cross & Trecker will post a net loss of $5.2 million on revenues of $440 million in its current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30; for the 1989 fiscal year, he forecasts earnings of $19.1 million, or $1.55 a share, on sales of $530 million. **********Salomon Brothers' Mr. Sutliff was cooler toward Cross & Trecker because of its dependence on transfer lines and assembly systems, huge complexes that work together to churn out completed parts, like engine blocks. ''There's excess capacity there, and fewer manufacturers use transfer lines,'' he said. ''They've been trying to whittle their big systems down, but they've had all kinds of problems.'' He forecasts a 2.5 percent decline in revenues, to $412 million, in the fiscal year 1988, and a net loss of $12.6 million. **********But Mr. McGinty of First Boston was more optimistic about Cross & Trecker's transfer lines because he thought that auto makers were likely to retool for new engines and drive trains. ''There's a strong demand for new engines out there, V-6's and other larger ones,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/29/business/japanese-growth-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Growth Seen", "print_headline": "Japanese Growth Seen", "body_text": " **********Japan's economy will continue to expand in the near future, the Economic Planning Agency said today as it released its monthly leading indicator.

Thurow (Aug. 21) and Robert L. Heilbroner (Sept. 4). The articles prompted an unusually strong response from readers concerned about keeping America competitive. Some of their comments follow: **********To the Editor: **********The major players in corporate and financial America are precisely those who have failed to demonstrate that they understand or are ready to carry out the game plan implicit in Mr. Thurow's recommended economic policies for the next President. **********In the most pro-business Administration in modern times, corporate America by and large has failed to invest in its work force, has preferred merger mania to sound productive growth and has permitted our schools to turn out precisely the undereducated, often illiterate, young adults around whom Mr. Thurow builds his hopes for the future.  SUMNER M. ROSEN  Columbia University  New York, Aug. 26 **********To the Editor: **********Lester Thurow argues correctly that the next President must address two critical economic problems: **********No. 1: The elimination of our dependence on foreign funds that finance our massive trade deficits. **********No. 2: The reduction of our huge, chronic fiscal deficits, if we are to raise savings levels, lower interest rates, regain international competitiveness and preserve the living standards of the American people. **********Mr. Thurow's specific prescriptions, however, are insufficient to achieve these goals. One of his two fiscal proposals, a value-added tax, is regressive, bearing most heavily on low- and moderate-income families. **********Should not the next President first consider restoring equity and progressivity to the tax code? **********Mr. Thurow is right to prescribe increased investment, education-training and research to improve productivity. But the more immediate need, if we are to deal with our huge trade deficit, is to modernize and expand our domestic manufacturing. Long-term growth in productivity resulting from the measures that Mr. Thurow proposes will not rebuild our domestic manufacturing industries on a competitive basis within the time frame of the next Presidency nor avoid the severe recession that Mr. Thurow correctly fears.  MILTON J. ESMAN  STEVEN I. JACKSON  Cornell University  Ithaca, N. Y., Aug. 24 **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Thurow's excellent ''Briefing'' lists two prerequisites for this country to become competitive: better schooling for the work force and better management skills. **********Our work force suffers not only from lack of education, but also from a reduction of steady long-term employment that alone can give the intimate knowledge of the skills that lead to quality production. The increased use of temporary labor is part of the trouble. The cure lies in longer-term planning by management to reduce the attractiveness of temporary labor by legislating better fringe benefits for the ''temporaries.'' **********In this country, the skills of managers are less of a problem than what they pay attention to: deals and takeovers or production? The next quarterly report and its effect on the stock price or the results 5 or 10 years down the line? **********The remedy: Make deals more difficult, by regulation or legislation. Treat large-scale stock repurchases as what they really are, partial liquidation. Establish, by lawsuits or other means, that buyouts by management have a built-in conflict of interest.  KURT SOLMSSEN  Philadelphia, Aug. 28 **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Thurow's essay clearly outlines the risk of pursuing the high budget deficits of the Reagan Administration and possible steps to continue economic growth without further deficits. **********But he failed to address the fiscal restrictions of debt service and debt retiring. **********With national debt in the trillions of dollars, annual interest payments in the billions must be serviced from revenue or be capitalized with further borrowing. Furthermore, as bonds, notes and bills mature, the Treasury must either retire them with revenues or reissue the debt. Past deficits are clearly limiting the flexibility of the economy.  MONICA M. BONAR  New Rochelle, N. Y., Aug. 21 **********To the Editor: **********Robert L. Heilbroner correctly argues that there is nothing wrong with the Government running deficits to finance capital expenditures. **********What is curious is that he has come to love the deficit when the deficit has come to consist of very little capital expenditure. **********According to the Office of Management and Budget, in the 1950's and early 1960's capital outlays by the Government averaged more than six times the deficit. Between 1966 and 1980, capital outlays comprised 78 percent of Government deficits. Since 1980, however, capital outlays have been only 42 percent of Federal Government deficits.  STEVEN PRESSMAN  Monmouth College  West Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 20 **********To the Editor: **********Mr. Heilbroner's exuberance must be tempered. There is merit to his suggestion that ''investment type'' spending be removed from the operating budget. But such a separation requires that the operating budget reflect the depreciation or amortization of capital or investment type expenditures. **********Our recent experience with such investments as the Mianus River bridge and the Schoharie Creek bridge, among others, demonstrates that they have limited lives. Those who prepare budgets must respect those limits.  ALLAN P. SHUMOFSKY  Fairfield, Conn., Sept. 7 **********To the Editor: **********Regarding Mr. Heilbroner's article: You or I, as individuals, can go into bankruptcy. Companies and corporations can file for protection under Chapter 11. Countries can't - and don't - do that. When a country finds itself so broke that it can no longer meet its obligations (and when its citizens no longer will buy its bonds, notes, etc. - because they sense the end of the road has come), the country simply prints money and pays off all its obligations in worthless paper currency.) As has happened many times before, this translates into a situation where it takes a truckload of dollars to buy one egg - if indeed anyone will take the truckload. **********Whom does this hurt the most? The poor, the elderly, the children, those on pensions or social security, those on welfare - all those on the lower echelon of the economy.

But if it is decided that he should be tried as an adolescent, the court would have the option of reducing his sentence to 10 or 15 years. **********The decision insured that Mr. Hamadei's age would be a major consideration in the trial, which is now scheduled to start in Frankfurt early in July. **********Under West German law, youths between 14 and 18 can be sentenced to no more than 10 years in prison. They are not formally classified as adults until they reach 21. Between 18 and 21, they are considered young adults. At this age, the courts have considerable discretion. Judges can sentence young adults as youths or as adults, or can impose reduced adult sentences. **********Mr. Hamadei's lawyers say that he was born on July 15, 1968, which would have made him 16 at the time of the hijacking, which began on June 14, 1985. The prosecution has found a document giving his birthdate as June 13, 1964, which would mean he turned 21 on the eve of the hijacking. **********Last month, the criminal chamber of the Hesse State District Court ruled that even if this latter birthdate was correct, Mr. Hamadei would have been an adolescent when the planning for the crime began, and he sent the matter to the juvenile chamber. **********The juvenile court said today that it accepted jurisdiction because the birthdate remained in dispute, but it rejected the age asserted by the defense and said that Mr. Hamadei would be tried as at least an adolescent. **********This meant that trial sessions would be open to the public. But it also meant that if the court decides that Mr. Hamadei was under 21 at the time of the hijacking, he can receive a lesser sentence than life imprisonment. **********Mr. Hamadei is charged with leading the hijacking of Flight 847 in Beirut and with killing an American hostage, Robert Dean Stethem, a United States Navy diver. Mr. Hamadei was seized in January 1987 in Frankfurt while smuggling explosives into West Germany. **********Washington asked that he be extradited, but within weeks, two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut.

They said he used that name to rent a car in Athens that was discovered Monday near the port of Piraeus. **********A picture of Mr. Jaballah was found in the wreckage of another rented car that was blown up, apparently by accident, a few hours before the July 11 attack aboard the cruise ship City of Poros.

In the course of a year, some 325 products - ranging from chocolate-covered Bon-Bons to Drumstick cones, from frozen ices to packages of plain old ice cream - will roll off its production lines. **********But for its owner, the Carnation Company, and Carnation's deep-pocketed Swiss parent, Nestle S. A., the $80 million plant here is a gamble. The plant, which replaces aging facilities in Los Angeles and Oakland, will increase Carnation's capacity by 35 percent and could shake up the competitive balance in the $9.4 billion American market for ice cream and other frozen desserts. **********Designed to be operated by just 150 workers - and to be easily expanded if things go well - the new plant could prove to be a white elephant if an ice cream glut develops because manufacturers have added too much capacity. But if it allows Carnation to cut costs, boost quality, and switch to new products as rapidly as it projects, Carnation may pick up enough market share to make the plant a symbol of a new era - one in which huge capital investments are a prerequisite for survival in what had once been a regional business dominated by relatively small companies. **********Some critics say the new plant is a technical success but is doomed to be a business failure because Carnation paid far too much for what it got and did not automate as much as it should have. Whether or not such assessments prove correct, Carnation feels it has been technologically aggressive by dairy industry standards and, indeed, that it had no choice. **********''The real decision was a commitment to stay in the industry,'' said Jim Stangl, the third-generation ice cream maker chosen by Carnation to manage the plant. ''National companies like General Foods, Dole, Beatrice, Philip Morris, and Pillsbury got into the industry in the last 10 years with ice cream or competing dessert products, which forced Carnation to raise its sights.'' **********The idea that modern manufacturing techniques can be a powerful competitive weapon has been gaining ground in American industry, spurred by the success of the Japanese in overrunning the American consumer electronics industry and capturing large parts of other key markets. But Carnation's use of that strategy breaks new ground in the conservative dairy products industry, where the main manufacturing concern has traditionally been, simply, to meet sanitation standards. **********Because the basics of making ice cream and water-based treats like popsicles are simple and widely known, most producers consider large investments in manufacturing unlikely to advance the state of the art enough to pay off. Thus, most dairy companies look to innovative marketing or distribution improvements, rather than manufacturing, to gain a step on the competition. **********Carnation is betting that the factory will give it a strategic edge in two important, but different, markets: premium ice cream and novelty items. **********In the slow-growing market for bulk premium ice cream, the backbone of the industry, Carnation reckons it is No. 3 in production, with about 20 million gallons annually, about 4 million gallons less than Dreyers Grand Ice Cream Inc. Carnation says that the new plant should allow it to pass Dreyers and close in on Kraft Inc., maker of Breyers and Sealtest ice creams. **********Bulk ice cream, which is sold to supermarkets, ice cream shops, food services, and restaurants, is typified by few product changes and tight profit margins, usually hovering around 3 percent of sales. Carnation hopes to squeeze out a small percentage gain, which could sharply increase profits, by increasing production volumes. That would mean longer production runs for many flavors and products, cutting down on changeovers where ingredients and time are wasted. **********In the much more profitable, fad-driven novelty market, which includes such items as sandwiches, ice cream nuggets, sundaes and products on sticks, Carnation hopes the plant's flexibility will allow it to strengthen its hold on second place. **********That $1.5 billion segment, which has grown 50 percent in the past five years, is dominated by Gold Bond Ice Cream Inc., a Green Bay, Wisc., company that produces Popsicles and has, Carnation estimates, roughly three times Carnation's novelties volume. The challenge, Carnation says, is to design production lines that could make its novelties efficiently yet be flexible enough for new products. **********''The novelty market has been a jungle,'' said John M. McMillin, who follows the industry for Prudential Bache. There are several thousand novelty products. Those that become hits grow rapidly and, often, decline almost as quickly. **********No one knows whether the plant, which is just beginning to ship its products, will be the performer it must be to justify Carnation's huge investment. One way to gauge the risks facing Carnation is to compare its plant with one Dreyer's is building in Union City, Calif. The more conventional Dreyer's plant is less flexible and has one-third the capacity of the Carnation plant, but cost just $12 million, one-seventh Carnation's investment. **********To succeed, Carnation must sell the 35 million gallons a year the plant should produce when it hits its two-shift, five days-a-week capacity next summer. That will be tough. Analysts like Mr. McMillin say growth in the novelty business has slowed sharply. And competitors are building new bulk ice cream plants, which could produce an ice cream glut. Dreyer's plant, for example, will double the capacity of the one it is replacing. **********It will take years to determine if Carnation's plant could have benefited from more - or less - automation. Nor is it clear yet that another innovation at the plant - organizing employees into teams operating largely without management supervision - will be as effective in controlling costs as Carnation hopes. **********Carnation decided to gamble because of a confluence of industry trends, none of which, alone, would have supported a huge investment in a single facility. Some, such as the improvement in computerized process controls, make it possible to run larger production lines reliably. Others, such as the trend for supermarket chains to build large refrigeration facilities capable of receiving full truckloads, make it less important to build production facilities near big markets. **********''Carnation has recognized a shift in the structure of the bulk ice cream market and built a plant that couldn't have been built before,'' said Marc Particelli, senior vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. **********Early in the factory's planning, Carnation officials visited the Ft. Wayne, Ind., plant of Edy's Grand Ice Cream Inc., which is owned by Dreyer's and considered a pioneer in adapting the so-called worker team concept to the dairy industry. Carnation was intrigued with the idea of training workers to do many tasks and take responsibility for operating decisions, which means cutting supervision. **********''The team concept is a religion with me,'' said Ben Herbst, Edy's plant manager, when asked why he shared his experience with a rival. ''We have no supervisors here. We don't give orders. The plant starts up at 6:30 in the morning with no managers in sight.'' **********Carnation is starting out with its 150 employees organized into 11 teams. The work force, hired from a pool of 5,000 applicants, includes only 30 employees with ice cream production experience. ''That's no accident,'' said Mr. Stangl. ''We have a whole new manufacturing system that we didn't want screwed up with old habits.'' **********FOR now, teams are led by managers - ''coordinators'' in team-concept lingo - but Carnation says their job is to train teams to function without direction. ''Coordinators work themselves out of a job if successful,'' said Mr. Stangl. ''When they are done, we will move them to other plants to spread the concept.'' **********Local union representatives have doubts but are enthusiastic. ''It's a bit like asking the animals to run the zoo,'' said Don Frazer, executive officer of Teamsters Local 87, which represents the workers. ''I don't believe the concept will do exactly what they think it will, but it will work after a fashion and result in less need for supervision.'' **********Carnation's attention to flexibility included devising a layout and building a structure that will allow every key part of the production cycle to be expanded without interrupting production. That is expensive, but it insures that Carnation could exploit a surge in demand for its products without fearing that sales would be lost or that a rival might catch up during a shutdown for expansion. The plant's capacity to produce novelties - 52 million dozen a year - is roughly five times that of the typical plant in the industry. **********THE computerized process control system oversees a network that includes seven miles of piping to move raw materials from any of 29 milk holding tanks to 15 of the 20 production lines. Another five lines for water-ice products and other ''stick novelties'' are operated as a separate sub-network. Such arrangements should allow the company to schedule production so that there are fewer time-consuming product changes. **********An automated storage center maintains up to 1.5 million gallons of finished ice cream in a minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit environment, which allows the company to schedule money-saving full-day runs for more products. The large storage area also means that the plant can produce at high levels year-round even though 28 percent of all ice cream sales occur in July and August. **********''Everything is contemporary but only the control system and organization might be considered leading edge,'' said Mickey Kupperman, president of A. Epstein & Sons, which designed the plant. ''It's the combination that is unique.'' **********One rival plant designer who toured the facility while it was under construction agreed that it was ''very impressive'' but said he believes Epstein and Carnation made costly mistakes. **********''I think they paid perhaps $40 million too much for what they got,'' said Arthur Blanding, owner of the Omega Company of Janesville, Wisc. ''And they are going to have too many people because they did not automate enough, which could add perhaps $1.8 million a year to overhead. I suspect that it will turn out to be marginally profitable and you will see it for sale in eight years.'' **********Carnation and Epstein say that it made sense to stop short of fully automating the plant. ''We investigated a complete computer-integrated manufacturing system but there are so many variables in the ice cream business that the control technology isn't quite there yet,'' said Robert Milkie, Epstein's on-site supervisor. **********For example, he said, plastics used in packaging vary subtly from shipment to shipment, necessitating mechanical changes that are easier for humans to make than machines. Robots capable of operating in the frigid storage facility cannot deal efficiently with the many packaging shapes, he added. And Carnation believes it is cheaper to use people to mix nuts and berries into specialty ice creams with limited production. **********Carnation says that with automation and the team concept, output per worker should be four times that of worker output at the two plants it is closing. Some new capacity will be used to make specialty products such as Heaven Bars, which are now made by non-Carnation dairies, for nationwide distribution. The plant will also make new products developed in Europe by Nestle. But the real gains are expected to come in winning business from companies whose products it makes under license, such as Drumstick cones and Eskimo Pies, and by raising market share. **********If Carnation's bet proves to be a winner, the long-range impact could be to shake up the industry even more: it could drive more dairy products companies into the arms of wealthy multinational food giants like Nestle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/23/business/drexel-s-plea-bargain-will-limit-exposure-to-suits-employees-say.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1988-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Drexel's Plea Bargain Will Limit Exposure to Suits, Employees Say", "print_headline": "Drexel's Plea Bargain Will Limit Exposure to Suits, Employees Say", "body_text": " **********The six felony counts that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will admit involve circumstances in which the firm cheated a client, manipulated the marketplace and tricked a corporation into being taken over. **********But some of the other egregious violations asserted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in civil charges in September, including illegal insider trading, will not be mentioned in the criminal case. The omission is intended to limit Drexel's liability from private lawsuits by shareholders. None of the charges will specifically name any people who committed wrongdoing. **********Information about the criminal plea agreement and the six felony counts was disclosed yesterday by Drexel employees, a day after the company agreed in principle to settle the largest securities fraud case in Wall Street history for $650 million. **********The Government has not officially released terms of the settlement, which still requires approval of various Federal officials and is conditional on the settlement of the S.E.C. case. But employees at the firm said Drexel would plead guilty to five felony counts involving stock transactions with the speculator Ivan F. Boesky and a sixth count related to the stock trading practices of a small New Jersey trading company. **********Drexel's lawyers and Government prosecutors spent hours yesterday trying to agree upon the language of the plea. At one point in the early afternoon, the lawyers expected that a plea could have been entered in a Federal court in Manhattan by early evening. But some differences in wording delayed the filing. **********Meanwhile, as Wall Street reacted with relative calm to the news, executives at Drexel struggled to quell the strong dissent at the firm over the proposed accord.  [ Pages D4 and D5. ]  As part of the effort to bolster morale and remold the firm's tarnished image, some Drexel executives said they expected certain management changes soon. **********A person outside of Drexel said that Howard H. Baker Jr., former chief of staff for President Reagan and former Senate majority leader, is leaning toward accepting the job of chairman at the troubled firm if there are no further significant developments. A decision by Mr. Baker is expected within the next few weeks.  [ Page D3. ]  The circumstances behind the five criminal counts related to Mr. Boesky have already been outlined in the broader lawsuit by the S.E.C. He is the Government's main witness in the criminal and civil cases and is serving a three-year prison sentence after settling insider-trading charges. **********The five transactions between the investment firm and Mr. Boesky involved trading between 1984 and 1986 in the stocks of Fischbach, Phillips Petroleum, Stone Container, Harris Graphics and MCA, the Drexel employees said. The sixth count is based on trading between Drexel and Princeton/Newport Partners, the small New Jersey brokerage whose partners have been indicted for criminal racketeering. **********Drexel lawyers have insisted on the firm pleading guilty to crimes that offer the least likelihood of exposing it to larger liabilities from lawsuits brought by investors who may have lost money as a result of Drexel's trading practices. S.E.C. Case Is Broader **********On Wednesday, the United States Attorney in Manhattan and Drexel disclosed that the firm had agreed in principle to settle charges for $650 million and a guilty plea to six counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and securities fraud. The S.E.C. has charged in its civil action that Drexel and Mr. Boesky traded on insider information and illegally concealed the ownership of stock to circumvent the rules in more than a dozen transactions. **********While the lawyers were negotiating, Drexel executives began to try to heal a firm that remained bitterly divided over whether it should settle rather than fight the Government. **********Shortly before the settlement proposal was announced, intense lobbying efforts had been made by some executives loyal to Michael R. Milken, the head of the ''junk bond'' operations in Beverly Hills, Calif. **********A number of senior executives said they felt that the firm had betrayed Mr. Milken, who was the focus of the Government's two-year inquiry and the force behind Drexel's enormous successes in financing some of the largest corporate takeovers. Milken Confers With Lawyers **********Mr. Milken, who was in New York yesterday meeting with his lawyers, is expected to be indicted soon on charges that include racketeering, insider trading, and securities fraud. At that time, he is expected to leave the firm. **********Some of those who prevailed in arguing for a settlement said they had been concerned that if the firm were indicted for racketeering, it could lose an enormous amount of business long before a trial. In addition, the firm faced the prospect of having a large amount of assets frozen by the Government. **********Of the $650 million payment, $300 million will be paid to the Government as a fine and $350 million will be used as a fund for the investors and clients who claim to have lost money as a result of Drexel's actions. **********Lawyers for shareholders said the company's guilty plea is expected to prompt a wave of private civil actions against a firm that had already been facing lawsuits around the nation. **********If less than $350 million is used to compensate shareholders, the rest will be forfeited to the Government. If it is more, Drexel would have to pay the excess. Three Installments **********The $650 million will be paid in three installments. The first payment, for $500 million, will be made by Jan. 15. Another $50 million will be paid in 1990 and $100 million in 1992. **********People at Drexel said that less than $400 million had been reserved by the closely held company for a settlement. They added that the penalty and restitution payments would decrease the value of the shares of Drexel stock, most of which is owned by employees. The stock has a current book value of about $112 a share and after settling the criminal charges, each share would be likely to drop about $10 to $15. **********The plea bargaining agreement is contingent upon Drexel resolving its dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Jan. 10, although that deadline could be extended if significant progress is made. The agency must also approve exemptions that would permit a convicted felon to continue in certain securities businesses and investment advisory services. **********Lawyers for Drexel began talks with the S.E.C. yesterday to settle the civil charges that it defrauded clients, illegally traded insider information and manipulated the price of stocks. Of the 18 transactions mentioned in the S.E.C. action, five are the same as those outlined by the United States Attorney in Manhattan. 'Parking' Stock Charged **********In the S.E.C. action, Government lawyers have asserted that Mr. Boesky acted at Mr. Milken's request to ''park'' stock - that is conceal its ownership for illegal purposes - of Fischbach and Harris Graphics. **********In the case of Fischbach, according to the S.E.C., the stock was parked to trick executives into thinking that a third party had independently acquired a large block of stock. That was allegedly done in order to permit a Drexel client, Victor Posner, to get out of an agreement that forbade him from buying Fischbach stock. **********Mr. Posner, a Miami industrialist, is a defendant in the S.E.C. action. The agency also asserts that Mr. Milken manipulated the stock of the Stone Container Corporation in the spring of 1987. **********An S.E.C. settlement is expected to include a substantial financial penalty on top of the criminal penalty and an agreement by Drexel not to violate any securities laws or rules in the future. **********Though the plea bargain will resolve the criminal investigation by Federal authorities, the admission, which is expected to be entered soon, perhaps as early as today, is certain to prompt inquiries by the stock exchanges and by many of the states that have statutes fining or barring convicted felons from certain kinds of securities trading. Municipal Financing **********The guilty plea will also likely be a hard blow to Drexel's municipal financing business, as local governments become wary about bringing their business to a firm that has admitted that it engaged in corrupt practices. **********At the same time, a person involved in the investigation of Mr. Boesky said that the Drexel developments would prompt his lawyers to move for a reduced sentence. **********In March Mr. Boesky will mark his first anniversary in prison out of three-year sentence. As a general rule, a Federal prisoner must serve two-thirds of the time in prison before being considered for parole, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/about-real-estate-new-project-at-the-brooklyn-army-terminal.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "About Real Estate; New Project at the Brooklyn Army Terminal", "print_headline": "About Real Estate; New Project at the Brooklyn Army Terminal", "body_text": " **********Work is expected to begin early next year on New York City's $44.5 million plan to add a million square feet of industrial space to the Brooklyn Army Terminal, which the city acquired in 1981 as part of its campaign to retain manufacturing jobs. **********As the redevelopment project moves into the second phase, nearly 80 percent of the space in the first phase has been leased and negotiations are under way with potential tenants for the balance of the million square feet that has already been created there. **********The terminal has attracted 23 manufacturing companies since it reopened with renovated space in October 1987. Tenants now include the Vanguard Group Printing companies, which expanded its operations from Huntington, L.I.; the Lowel-Light Manufacturing Company; the C & W Sewing Machine Attachment Company and JoJo Sportwear Inc. **********The Army built the 97-acre waterfront complex in 1918 as a shipping operation to supply military bases around the world. When the city acquired the property, which runs from 58th to 66th Streets along Second Avenue in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, it had the goal of finding a private developer to rebuild it for manufacturing tenants. **********When no deals could be made, the city's Public Development Corporation, which holds the master lease for the terminal, decided to tackle the job. The project was the first in which the independent city agency served as its own developer, supervising the planning, construction, leasing and management of the new space. **********So far, the reconstruction effort has been limited to half of the space in one of two main terminal buildings. The P.D.C. spent $33 million on the installation of new plumbing, heating and electrical systems as well as for passenger and freight elevators and concrete platforms, doors and canopies for loading docks. A new lobby, featuring a gray, pink and black terrazzo floor and a glass curtain wall overlooking an open-air atrium, was also created in the eastern end of the eight-story building during the first phase of construction. **********The remodeling of the tenant spaces in the project's second phase will be similar to the renovation work already done. However, the new tenant spaces will be smaller and there will be more of them. While the 32 units in the first phase averaged 30,000 square feet in size, the 40 units to be built in the next phase will average 20,000 square feet. Space will be available for manufacturing tenants needing as little at 13,500 square feet. **********''We are trying to offer space to a wider range of tenants,'' said Cassandra DePreta, first executive vice president of the P.D.C. ''During the leasing period for the first part of the job, we were hearing from a lot of tenants who just could not use 30,000 square feet. But we could not divide the spaces for them because of the configuration of the building's mechanical systems and the problems that would have been created with things like bathrooms and access.'' **********Ms. DePreta said the higher costs of building the smaller units, along with inflation, accounted for the increased budget for the second phase of development. **********Blueprints for the second phase of redevelopment call for a three-lane delivery ramp to be built at the southern end of the complex to provide another entrance, said Fred Bland, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, the project's architectural firm. A smaller lobby will be added to the southern end of the building and a covered walkway will be built in the atrium. The developers will also provide 4,700 square feet of retail space to be leased to restaurants and service-oriented business. **********The building's tenants, who pay an average of $4 a square foot for space, have leases that range from 10 to 20 years. Their leases with the city call for rents to remain constant for the first five years of the contract. The annual increases after that are tied to the Consumer Price Index. **********Most tenants said they had been attracted to the Army Terminal by the opportunity to sign leases that are longer than those offered by the typical industrial landlord, as well as by the city's package of cost-saving incentives. **********E-B Designs Ltd., a company that had outgrown its space in Coney Island, almost left New York State entirely last year. **********''We spent months looking for space and had no intention of coming to the Army Terminal,'' said Aaron Mazel, a principal in E-B Designs, a company that makes and sells jewelry. ''We were very close to moving to Providence, R.I., where some of our material is made. That city was pitching hard to get us to make the move. But leaving Brooklyn would have also meant losing most of our people. Training new people would have been time-consuming and expensive.'' **********When it moved to the Army Terminal, E-B Designs increased its work force to 150 employees from 100. **********The P.D.C expects the new space to be ready for occupancy in July 1990. Although rents for the space have not been established, agency officials said they would be higher than those in the first phase to reflect the added cost of reconstruction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/16/business/business-people-brown-root-continues-changing-of-the-guard.html": {"writer_name": "Nina Andrews", "pub_date": "1988-12-16", "snippet": "LEAD: Brown & Root, a major international engineering and construction company, has elected W.

Both appointments at Brown & Root, a Houston-based subsidiary of the Halliburton Company, will become effective Jan. 1. **********''This is a normal part of planning for succession,'' said Thomas H. Cruikshank, president and chief executive of Halliburton, who said that Mr. Pieper was in line to take over Brown & Root when Mr. Austin retired in 1990. **********A 31-year employee of Brown & Root, Mr. Pieper has served in a variety of capacities, including chief engineer and, most recently, senior executive vice president of operations. ''He has as detailed a knowledge of Brown & Root's operations as anybody,'' Mr. Cruikshank said from his office in Dallas. ''I have every confidence in his ability to take over.'' **********Mr. Pieper is one of the management team responsible for shrinking and restructuring Brown & Root, which once had 85,000 employees before the slump in the oil industry that began in the early 1980's. **********The company, which now has about 30,000 employees worldwide, operates in industry units, including petroleum, chemical, civil, marine and aerospace, instead of in its former geographically divided groups. One of the first companies to design oil operations in the North Sea, Brown & Root still has 3,000 engineers based in its London office, Mr. Pieper said. **********After several years in the red, the company's core businesses are back on their feet and continue to improve, Mr. Cruikshank said. Revenues for the first nine months of 1988 for Halliburton's engineering and construction segments, of which Brown & Root produces virtually the entire amount, improved 20 percent from the comparable period last year, to $1.5 billion, while earnings have increased two and a half times, to $37.8 million. **********The company's new businesses include a group that manages United States armed services operations, chiefly the Air Force bases in Turkey, and a new aerospace venture, Mr. Pieper said. **********The son of a building contractor in Beeville, a small town in south-central Texas, Mr. Pieper attended Rice University, where he received a bachelor's degree in engineering in 1954. After a stint in the Army he joined a Houston engineering firm. When Brown & Root offered him a raise, just months later, he joined the company's marine engineering group in 1957. **********Active in a variety of industry, educational and commercial groups, Mr. Pieper lives in Houston with his wife, Adele. They have two grown daughters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/09/business/deal-in-new-zealand.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deal in New Zealand", "print_headline": "Deal in New Zealand", "body_text": " **********A company partly owned by Rupert Murdoch has acquired four New Zealand newspapers.

Shultz has made a strong personal statement expressing visceral contempt for terrorism and left an imprint on Middle East policy that could last well into the Bush Administration. **********State Department officials said today that Mr. Shultz's personal feelings about terrorism outweighed the other factors he considered, including United States obligations to the United Nations and the effects of his decision on the search for a negotiated settlement in the Middle East. **********By blocking entry to this country for Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the United States denied Mr. Arafat a platform to address the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. Looking to Geneva **********But American diplomats at the United Nations warned Mr. Shultz that the General Assembly might convene a special session in Geneva early next year specifically to hear Mr. Arafat. If that happens, it might elevate the status of the P.L.O. chief and of his cause even more than if he had spoken this week at the United Nations. **********The visa decision, likely to be one of Mr. Shultz's final acts as Secretary of State, follows five years in which the Secretary has tried sporadically to revive peace negotiations in the Middle East. State Department officials said the decision did not reflect Mr. Shultz's pique or frustration at that process, but the depth of his feelings on terrorism. **********In the debate over policy toward the P.L.O., Mr. Shultz's statement on Saturday was a milestone because it was far more explicit than prior American statements in holding Mr. Arafat responsible for terrorist acts committed in the last three years, since the P.L.O. supposedly renounced terrorism. 'Convincing Evidence' **********''The U.S. Government has convincing evidence that P.L.O. elements have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others,'' the State Department said in explaining Mr. Shultz's decision. Those P.L.O. elements, it said, include Force 17, described as ''a personal security force for Arafat and other P.L.O. leaders,'' and the Hawari group, which conducts special operations for Al Fatah, Mr. Arafat's mainstream faction of the P.L.O. **********In recent years, the United States has described the P.L.O. as an umbrella group that includes terrorists, and it has focused its criticism less on Al Fatah than on other groups. But the statement on Saturday said Mr. Arafat was ''an accessory'' to terrorism because he ''knows of, condones and lends support to such acts.'' **********Mr. Shultz presumably remembered that Al Fatah took responsibility for placing a car bomb near a hotel where he was staying in Jerusalem in March. In a statement to a news agency in Beirut, the group said Mr. Shultz was the target. **********State Department officials said they felt that they were taken in by the publicity surrounding the meeting this month in Algiers of the Palestine National Council, the policy-making body for the P.L.O. 'Positive Elements' **********They said they found on close examination that the session produced less than they had been led to expect: neither an explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist nor a renunciation of terror in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since 1967. **********There seemed to be a contradiction between the Administration's initial, hopeful comments on the P.L.O. meeting and its later, more severe assessment. On Nov. 15, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said he had noted ''positive elements'' in the statements emerging from Algiers. **********A day later, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said the statements represented ''an advance over previous efforts'' but were too ambiguous to satisfy American criteria for dealing with the P.L.O. **********President-elect Bush was not consulted on the decision to deny a visa to Mr. Arafat, a spokesman for Mr. Bush said today. James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State-designate, will have to deal with the consequences of Mr. Shultz's action. But other aides to Mr. Bush said the President-elect would hold the P.L.O. to the strict standards of accountability articulated by Mr. Shultz. Similar Stand for Bush **********Mr. Bush, the head of President Reagan's task force on terrorism, endorsed those standards in the election campaign, and that position has strong support in Congress. Vice President-elect Dan Quayle is among 51 senators who signed a letter urging Mr. Shultz not to issue a visa for Mr. Arafat. **********This would make it even more difficult for a Bush Administration to relax American conditions for dialogue with the P.L.O., even if the new President wanted to, and there is no evidence that he does. One of those conditions is that the P.L.O. renounce terrorism. **********Mr. Reagan said today that he strongly supported Mr. Shultz's decision. ''Under the law, that is the province of the Secretary of State,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''But yes, I agreed very much with his decision.'' Asked if the decision might send the wrong signal, suggesting that the United States was impeding the Middle East peace process, Mr. Reagan said: ''I think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal. That we were patsies.'' Administration Infighting **********The debate over a visa for Mr. Arafat generated infighting in the Reagan Administration and among State Department officials. Mr. Shultz listened to the conflicting advice at a meeting in his office on Friday afternoon and made known his decision on Saturday. **********Among those said to have been in favor of issuing the visa were Michael H. Armacost, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs; Richard W. Murphy, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs; Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, and senior members of the United States mission to the United Nations, all Middle East experts. **********They had two basic arguments. The first boiled down to avoiding another tussle with the United Nations, which criticized American efforts earlier this year to shut down the P.L.O. observer mission at the United Nations. The second was a concern that denying the visa would provoke protest from Arab countries and from allies in Europe. Shultz's Mideast Experience **********Those arguing against a visa for Mr. Arafat included Richard S. Williamson, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs; L. Paul Bremer 3d, head of the State Department's counterterrorism program, and Charles Hill, Mr. Shultz's top personal assistant, who has been political officer at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv and head of the State Department office dealing with Israel. Mr. Shultz's experiences in the Middle East were also important. When he took office in 1982, some thought he would favor Arab interests because he had been president of the Bechtel Group, which has done large amounts of construction work in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Shultz went considerably further than any member of the Administration in expressing sympathy for the Palestinian people. **********Mr. Shultz seemed to become disillusioned with Syria and other Arab nations in 1983, after Syria rejected an agreement that he had worked out for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. 'Strategic Cooperation' **********Inside the Administration, Mr. Shultz became a strong advocate of ''strategic cooperation'' with Israel. In 1984 and 1985, he became the pre-eminent advocate of strong action against terrorists, supporting the use of military force in situations where it was opposed by Caspar W. Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense at the time. **********Mr. Shultz's disgust for terrorists was a major factor in his lonely efforts to stop the sale of American weapons to Iran as part of a deal for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. **********Arab diplomats said Mr. Shultz's decision set back the Middle East peace process by showing that there was no reward for steps taken by the P.L.O. to adopt a more moderate line. But State Department officials said the decision could actually help the peace process by prodding the P.L.O. to move further in that direction. 'Not an Anti-Arab Policy' **********''U.S. opposition to terrorism is not an anti-Arab policy,'' said a State Department official, noting that terrorists had maimed moderate Palestinians willing to work with Israel. ''If terror can be tamped down, moderates might be more willing to come forward.'' **********An Arab Ambassador said Mr. Shultz's decision was ''a slap in the face'' to moderate Arabs like King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Officials in those two countries publicly lamented Mr. Shultz's decision. But Nadav Safran, a professor of Middle East studies at Harvard University, said their private feelings were probably different. **********''King Hussein would be rather pleased by anything that shows he is needed in the peace process because Arafat has not purged hismelf enough to be a candidate for dialogue and negotiations,'' Mr. Safran said. ''And since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel, the P.L.O. called for the Egyptian people to rise up against their Government and gloated when President Sadat was assassinated in 1981.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/business/finance-briefs-828688.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** MNC Financial has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of up to $100 million in medium-term notes with maturities ranging from nine months to 15 years.

Unauthorized Examination **********Last week, G.S.A. officials and Congressional staff members reported that secret bids for the FTS-2000 might have been examined by someone without proper authorization. Many of the agency's officials and employees who worked on the switching contracts are involved with the FTS-2000. **********The decision on A.T.&T. is also important because it is the first ruling on accusations that have been made for some time by critics of the G.S.A.: that the agency's bidding practices are faulty and in need of revision. **********At least one of the other bidders, the Pacific Telesis Group, said it would appeal the panel's finding to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. **********The Justice Department and the G.S.A.'s inspector general are conducting a criminal investigation into the contract dispute. **********The ruling is a major victory for A.T.&T., which filed a protest with the Board of Contract Appeals in October, accusing the agency of applying different standards to its bid than those used to evaluate the bids of its competitors. **********Herb Linnen, an A.T.&T. spokesman in Washington, said that the company was pleased with the board's decision and particularly that the board dismissed as ''frivolous'' the G.S.A.'s assertion that A.T.&T. may have also received proprietary bid information from Mr. Soni. **********''We remain gravely concerned about the larger implications of the G.S.A.'s conduct in this entire matter,'' Mr. Linnen said. ''Clearly, based on today's decision, something must be done to restore public confidence in the integrity of the G.S.A.'s procurements.'' **********Clyde Pearce, the G.S.A.'s general counsel, said that the board's decision rejected A.T.&T.'s claim in its protest that the agency was intentionally biased against the company. He added that the mistakes that were made were technical flaws in the evaluation process that put A.T.&T. at a disadvantage. **********The disputed contracts, which are worth $55 million, would provide the Government with computerized switch operations in 12 major cities. A.T.&T. won five contracts and seven went to the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the BellSouth Corporation, U S West Inc., and Pacific Telesis. Awards Called Erroneous **********Judge Vincent A. LaBella, an administrative judge who issued the ruling on behalf of the board, said that the G.S.A. did not evaluate A.T.&T.'s bid proposal as it had specified it would when it solicited bids. He also said the agency improperly considered the company's volume discount. For this reason, he added, awards were erroneously made to Bell Atlantic for the Philadelphia location and to Pacific Telesis for San Francisco. He ordered the contracts terminated and awarded to A.T.&T. **********Judge LaBella also instructed the agency to award to A.T.&T. contracts that had previously been given to BellSouth for the Atlanta and New Orleans areas because Mr. Soni had disclosed to BellSouth officials a ''price to beat'' for the contracts and because it was improper for Mr. Soni to negotiate a Government contract with a company that employs his daughter, Neelam. **********Federal procurement laws prohibit a Government employee from engaging in auction techniques such as releasing a vendor's proprietary bid information to competitors or advising a vendor of its price standing relative to another bidder. **********''What is clear from this record is that Mr. Soni implemented a type of auction technique that is clearly prohibited by regulation and violative of the statutory requirement for full and open competition,'' Judge LaBella wrote. 'Appearance of Impropriety' **********In addition, Judge LaBella noted ''the inescapable appeareance of impropriety'' from Mr. Soni's acceptance of gratuities in the form of free meals from BellSouth employees. In his ruling, the judge cited an expense voucher from a BellSouth official for a $48.92 lunch tab that read: ''Lunch at 'Bay Street,' Atlanta, Ga., to discuss pending G.S.A. ETN proposal and to discuss career opportunities within telecommunications industry. Attending were Lal Soni, network engineer G.S.A. Washington D.C.; Neelam Soni daughter of Mr. Lal Soni Atlanta & Self. Tax & tip included.'' **********Mr. Soni's lawyer, John Dowd, said, ''When all is said and done it will be demonstrated that Mr. Soni did not reveal any proprietary information or accept any gratuity.'' **********In reaching its decision, the G.S.A. board relied partly on information provided by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is conducting an investigation into the matter. The board requested similar information from the office of the G.S.A.'s inspector general, which refused the request. Technological Framework **********The phone switch contracts are important since they would lay the technological framework for the FTS-2000 system. Winners of the phone switch work would have a cost advantage in the FTS-2000 bidding because the switches can be used to run the new Government phone network. **********''I am deeply suspicious and concerned that the $25 billion contract is essentially being awarded under the same procedures with the same cast of characters - and there is no guarantee that the same thing won't happen again,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, a vocal critic of the agency's handling of the phone contracts. **********Scott Smith, a spokesman for Pacific Telesis, said in announcing that the company would appeal, ''We feel that G.S.A.'s cost evaluation of the bid was proper and should not have been reversed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/21/business/zinc-price-up-in-europe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zinc Price Up in Europe", "print_headline": "Zinc Price Up in Europe", "body_text": " **********The price of zinc, a metal used mainly in galvanizing steel, hit a three-year high on the London Metal Exchange today as big European producers raised their official prices, citing increased demand.

With the growth, however, came the specter of inflation. **********The Commerce Department said today that the nation's total output of goods and services grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after adjustment for inflation. This revision of the gross national product was two-tenths of a percentage point higher than the rate the department reported last month. If the effect of the drought were excluded, the G.N.P. would have risen at a very strong rate of 4.3 percent. **********At the same time, prices rose faster than at any time since the third quarter of 1982, the department said. Impact on Election Campaign **********Vice President Bush is likely to benefit from an economy that continues to expand through the November election. But if the Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates in an attempt to contain inflation, as it did earlier this month, the higher cost of borrowing could hurt the Republicans. **********An economic adviser to Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee, said the short-term economic outlook seemed to be helpful to the Republicans. **********''If the American people avert their eyes from the storm clouds on the horizon and only look at the short-term economic indicators, this report may be good for Bush,'' said the adviser, Robert B. Reich, a Harvard professor of political economy and management. **********Norman Robertson, chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said: ''The inflation picture is obviously worrisome. We have an inflation rate of around 5 percent, and I think that is too high for comfort.'' **********The financial markets took today's news hard. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.82 points, to 2,010.85, and bond prices declined. On Tuesday the markets shrugged off the news that the Consumer Price Index rose at a 5.2 percent annual rate in July. **********Economists said today that one reason the higher price index did not alarm Wall Street was that much of the rise was a result of the drought's effect on food prices. Indeed, once the highly volatile food and energy sectors were factored out of the index, the underlying rate of inflation was three-tenths of 1 percent for July, or less than 4 percent at an annual rate. **********Today's report included two price measures that are used only in calculating the gross national product. **********One measure, the G.N.P. implicit price deflator, rose at a 5.1 percent annual rate, up from the 4.1 percent rate reported last month. That was far higher than the 1.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter and well above the 3.3 percent for all of 1987. This index, which measures not just price changes but also the composition of the gross national product, is closely watched although it is considered volatile and subject to distortion. A Less-Volatile Measure **********The other measure, which is less volatile, is the fixed-weighted G.N.P. price index. It remained at 4.7 percent annual rate after revision. That, too, far exceeded its 3.5 percent rate of the first quarter and the 3.6 percent for all of last year. The fixed-weighted index measures only changes in prices. **********Economists surmised that the markets' responses today reflected fears of higher interest rates ahead. While the consumer price increase had been widely predicted on Wall Street, the strength of the inflation numbers in the G.N.P. report apparently unsettled traders. **********Other economic fears were expressed abroad. The central banks of Britain, West Germany, France and other nations increased their lending rates in an effort to keep the dollar from rising further and to stem inflation at home. **********Earlier this month the Federal Reserve showed a willingness to ignore domestic political considerations when it raised its discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, a two-year high, from 6 percent. It acted out of concern that the threat of inflation had increased because the economy was growing too rapidly. **********Mr. Robertson of the Mellon Bank predicted that the Federal Reserve would be unsettled by today's economic report and might decide to raise interest rates further. **********In addition to the G.N.P. report, the Commerce Department said today that after-tax corporate profits rose 11 1/2 percent in the second quarter, following a 2 1/2 percent increase in the first quarter. The latest increase is the largest since the second quarter of 1983. Drought Held Revision Down **********Although the upward revision in the gross national product was slight, it would have been considerably more if the Midwest had not been suffering from the harshest drought in decades. The Commerce Department said the drought reduced crop and livestock production in the second quarter by $2.4 billion - equivalent to a full percentage point of the G.N.P. on an annual basis. The department said the drought would continue to exert a drag on the economy. It estimated the losses in output for the year at an inflation-adjusted $14.3 billion. **********Nevertheless, it appears that the economy is unlikely to lose strength soon. The Reagan Adminstration raised its forecast for 1988 growth in June to 3 percent from 2.4 percent, and Robert Ortner, Under Secretary of Commerce, said that it would easily reach that goal. **********''We are well ahead of that pace, and I think we are going to see the economy moderate in the second half,'' Mr. Ortner said. ''The economy is obviously fundamentally strong and has a great deal of momentum that is going to carry through this year.'' **********Today's report showed that economic strength came mainly from a vigorous export sector, heavy investment by business and continued strong consumer spending. **********During the second quarter the trade deficit situation improved. Exports of goods and services improved at an annual rate of $18.9 billion, compared with a $17 billion rate in the first quarter. Investment by Business Up 17.9% **********Investment by businesses soared 17.9 percent in the second quarter, while consumers increased their buying at a 2.7 percent annual rate. **********Economists noted that inventories were dwindling in the second quarter, implying a need to build inventories in the third quarter, an impetus that is likely to contribute to the economic momentum. **********The stock market's reaction to the G.N.P. report today had many Wall Street economists scratching their heads. But some concluded that only part of the decline was attributable to the news of inflation and that the rest was attributable to the news of foreign central banks' increasing their interest rates. **********Jason Benderly, co-director of economics at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, ''Prior to the G.N.P. report at 8:30 this morning, the bond market had already sold off on the news of European central banks' raising rates.'' **********But once the G.N.P. report was released, he said, investor sentiment began to swing. **********''What our trading people were saying was that initially the market looked at the deflator number and dropped,'' he said. That number was revised substantially upward from 5.1 percent from 4.1 percent last month. **********''But they all know that the deflator is a bad indicator, and when they looked at the fixed-weighted price index, which is a much better indicator of overall inflation, they saw that it had not been revised, so the market came back some,'' Mr. Benderly said. **********But the gyrations were not over. ''Then they looked at the composition of the G.N.P. and it looked less favorable,'' he said. ''Final sales growth was revised up, inventory growth was revised down, and that told the market that while overall growth was not much more than had been reported last month, the composition suggested more forward momentum for the economy, more upward pressure on inflation and more pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates.''       $   Current Prices        Last    Pct.

Every few years, Government commissions or blue ribbon panels are appointed to study military procurement problems. Topics for study usually include cost overruns, cost assignment errors, high-priced spare parts, schedule delays and technical performance failures. Time after time, these commissions make their recommendations - with which most Government officials agree - but within a year or two, key military managers change, the recommendations fade and new problems emerge. **********My colleague, James Field and I, have completed a four-year study of the military acquisition process and the barriers to improving that process. On the basis of our study, we have concluded that the most serious problem is that too many people assigned to key acquisition positions - at every level in the Defense Department - are woefully unprepared for their jobs. **********Too few Government managers, for example, are knowledgeable about industrial cost estimating, cost accounting, financial incentives, cost control, scheduling and technical performance. They also lack knowledge about the implications of contract changes on large industrial companies. As a result, they are often unable to resist pressure to expand and complicate programs and they fail to reward lean industrial contractors. **********Congress and the Defense Department are now considering new contract forms, better planning, control and reporting systems and other procedural changes. But these changes will have little effect unless there are rewards for effective implementation. **********Unfortunately, too many senior Pentagon officials hold the view that program managers merely serve a liaison function and therefore have no need of years of training and experience in industrial management and cost control. These Pentagon officials believe the program manager's job should be limited to promoting a program, preparing progress reports and performing technical liaison. Thus, they regard experience as a pilot, tank commander, ship captain, or engineer, along with a mere 14 to 20 weeks of classroom instruction, as sufficient for the management of large programs. But in reality, this is grossly inadequate for the rigorous oversight, negotiation with and control over the large industrial companies that perform military development and production work. **********Despite the Government's urgent need for highly qualified acquisition managers, there are very few incentives for talented and experienced officers to remain in the military service beyond 20 to 25 years. In contrast, the military industry provides its managers with attractive salaries and full careers. To address these incentives, Government acquisition careers must be designed to attract officers to remain in the military service five to ten years longer than at present. Offering incentives for longer, dedicated careers in acquisition would slow the ''revolving door'' between the military and its contractors. **********Perhaps the only effective way to enhance the military acquisition career field is to establish a separate military corps for acquisition managers, a step taken with considerable success in France. The corps would need to include elite managers - military and civilian - dedicated to achieving the goals of the acquisition process. Advancement would be based strictly on management ability and performance. Only senior acquisition officers, with no interference from combat arms officers, would control assignments. **********Reluctance to establish more appropriate incentives have been a serious deficiency in most programs to improve military procurement during the past three decades. Contractors should be rewarded with higher profits for complying with schedules, satisfying promised performance standards and delivering goods and services at or below contracted cost. Conversely, penalties, in the form of reduced profits, should be imposed for late delivery, substandard work, and cost overruns. The source selection process should insure that prospects for obtaining future contracts are closely linked to performance, rather than promise. **********EQUALLY fundamental changes should be made in the incentives applicable to Government program managers. They should be rewarded for effective use of formal and informal analysis and control techniques; early identification of problems affecting cost, schedule, and technical performance, and success in achieving program objectives and controlling program costs. **********Many in Government and industry want to improve the acquisition process. But it is unrealistic to expect any lasting improvement if an appropriate system of incentives and disincentives is not established and enforced. For example: **********Unless changes are made in the contractor source selection process, which makes optimistically low-cost estimates a significant advantage in competing for a contract, it is useless to discuss realistic contractor proposals. And unless changes are made in the profit system that demands higher costs as a prerequiste for higher profits, it is futile to expect lower costs. **********The profit system needs a major overhaul to relate profits more to contract performance than to the level of costs. Unless changes are made in military careers that currently provide few opportunities for those beyond age 45 or 50, it is unrealistic to expect military officers not to seek a second career in the defense industry. **********There is little likelihood that the costs of major programs will stabilize or decrease unless skilled Government managers at all levels develop a strong commitment to change. Minor adjustments or corrections to the present system will not accomplish this vital goal. Neither will major reorganizations that simply seek to increase the decision-making authority of officers who lack training and experience. If we fail to act we will guarantee a continuation of the current problems of cost growth, reduced military capability and an increased risk of a major financial crisis for the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/06/business/japanese-trade-pact-is-signed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Trade Pact Is Signed", "print_headline": "Japanese Trade Pact Is Signed", "body_text": " **********Japan and the United States today signed a farm-trade agreement reached last month that would eventually dismantle Tokyo's quotas on imports of beef, oranges and orange juice.

Some Criticism 'Justified' **********Desiree Tucker, the agency's public affairs director, said some of the G.A.O. criticism was justified. She said some corrective action had been taken, including the streamlining of management systems. **********About the high cancellation rate for trade promotion events, she noted that the activities have a ''tentative'' two-year planning cycle that must remain flexibile. **********''Things are all based on a changing market environment,'' she said. **********In preparing the report, G.A.O. investigators visited 20 overseas posts of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service. **********Several posts complained that they had been forced to support trade missions unrelated to the best market prospects of the countries in which they were situated.

Gorbachev delivered yesterday in Moscow, as distributed in translation by the Soviet press agency Tass: **********We are facing many intricate questions. But which one of them is the crucial one? As the C.C. C.P.S.U. sees it, the crucial one is that of reforming our political system. **********The Central Committee has expounded its platform in the theses for the conference. We did not intend to give ready-made answers to all matters. We figured that new ideas and proposals would arise in the course of the discussion, and that the conference take them into account. Its decisions then would really be a collective achievement of the whole party and people. **********It follows that the political objective of our conference is to examine the period after the April 1985 C.C. plenum and the 27th congress of the C.P.S.U. comprehensively and critically, to enrich the strategy and specify the tactics of our changes, and define the ways, means and methods that would assure the steady advancement and irreversibility of our perestroika, and to do so in the spirit of Lenin's traditions and with reference to available experience.  Improving Food Supplies **********It seems to me that the search for ways of improving food supplies must continue everywhere, and notably in those regions and republics where the situation has not changed or is improving too slowly. This should be done with the involvement of all people, based on a thorough-going analysis of the state of agriculture. **********On what aspects must attention be concentrated? Experience shows that the shortest and most dependable way of achieving the desired output of food is broad introduction everywhere of lease arrangements and other effective forms of organizing and stimulating labor. That is the key element of the current agrarian policy. **********The results achieved by collectives that have lease or contractual arrangements have proved that crop yields and animal productivity can be raised in a relatively short time, that labor productivity can be substantially heightened, that losses can be reduced, and that farm products can be of good quality. Precisely this experience, comrades, yields the answer to the main question, that of how soon the country can resolve the food problem. Everything depends on how quickly we can arouse people's interests and promote the work of contractual and lease collectives, on how broadly we enlist farmers in this process and make them true masters on the farm.  Changing Managerial Forms **********We are running into undisguised attempts at perverting the essence of the reform, at filling the new managerial forms with old content. All too often, ministries and departments depart from the letter and spirit of the law on enterprises, with the result, as many economists admit, that it is not being fully carried out. **********This is borne out by how plans of enterprises for the current year were worked out, with the previous system of obligatory production quotas being, In effect, sustained under the guise of state orders. This is nothing but abuse on the part of the ministries in the absence of requisite control, or in some cases the result of condonement, by the state planning committee and standing organs of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers. **********And what is most intolerable is that enterprises are being compelled by means of state orders to manufacture goods that are not in demand, compelled for the simple reason that they want to attain the notorious ''gross output'' targets. Fiat of this sort was practiced even in the case of such large enterprises as the Urals engineering works, the Altai agricultural machinery works, the Kurgan tractor works and the Baku tire plant, to say nothing of the mass of medium-sized and small enterprises. **********Oh, how many faithful servants we have of ''gross output''! **********Need I say that this is wholly contrary to the sense of the reform, that it amounts to conservation of managerial methods that have driven our economy into a dead-end. **********Nevertheless, while drawing lessons from the past, we have to acknowledge that command methods of administration did not spare the field of foreign policy either. it sometimes happened that even decisions of vital importance were taken by a narrow circle of people without collective, comprehensive examination or analysis, on occasion without properly consulting friends either. this led to an inadequate reaction to international events and to the policies of other states, if not to mistaken decisions. unfortunately, the cost of this to the people and the implications of this or that course of action were not always weighed up. **********In response to the nuclear challenge to us and to the entire socialist world it was necessary to achieve strategic parity with the U.S.A. and this was accomplished. But, while concentrating enormous funds and attention on the military aspect of countering imperialism, we did not always make use of the political opportunities opened up by the fundamental changes in the world in our efforts to assure the security of our state, to scale down tensions, and promote mutual understanding between nations. as a result, we allowed ourselves to be drawn into an arms race, which could not but affect the country's socioeconomic development and its international standing. **********As the arms race approached a critical point, our traditional political and social activities for peace and disarmament began, on this background, to lose their power of conviction. to put it even more bluntly, without overturning the logic of this course, we could actually have found ourselves on the brink of a military confrontation. **********Hence, what was needed was not just a refinement of foreign policy, but its determined reshaping.  The Political System **********Why, then, is the task of radically reforming the political system being put forward today? first and foremost, comrades, it is a fact - and we have to admit this today - that at a certain stage the political system established as a result of the October revolution underwent serious deformations. This made possible the omnipotence of Stalin and his entourage, and the wave of repressive measures and lawlessness. The command methods of administration that arose in those years had a dire effect on various aspects of the development of our society. Rooted in that system are many of the difficulties that we experience to this day. . . . **********The existing political system proved incapable of protecting us from the growth of stagnation phenomena in economic and social life in the latter decades, and doomed the reforms undertaken at the time of failure. while functions of economic management became increasingly concentrated in the hands of the party-political leadership, the role of the executive apparatus at the same time increased out of all proportion. . . **********In the period of stagnation the machinery of management, which had grown to almost a hundred national ministries and government agencies, and eight hundred in the republics, began practically to dictate its will in both the economic and the political field. it was these agencies and other administrative structures that handled the execution of the decisions taken, and that by their action or inaction determined what would be and what would not be. The soviets - and, in many respects, the party bodies as well - proved unable to control this pressure from departmental interests. It became a universal rule that the body taking the decisions bore no economic responsibility for the implications of its actions. **********Another serious shortcoming of the political system that had taken shape was the excessive governmentalization of public life. to be sure, the tasks and functions of the state under socialism are much bigger in scope than under capitalism. but as conceived by the founders of Marxism-Leninism, management functions should be expanded not by strengthening power resting upon high-handed administration and compulsion, but above all increasing the role of the democratic factor and involving broad sections of the people in administration.  Tasks at Hand **********In raising the question of cardinally reforming the political system, we must proceed above all from a clear understanding of which of its qualities have stood the test of time and are needed by us today, and which, on the contrary, have to be reduced to a minimum or overcome completely. **********This, it seems to us, should imply the accomplishment of the following basic tasks. **********First, everything must be done to include millions upon millions of people in administering the country in deed, not in word. **********Second, the maximum scope must be given to the processes of the self-regulation and self-government of society, and the conditions must be created for the full development of the initiative of citizens, representative bodies of government, party and civic organizations, and work collectives. **********Third, it is necessary to adjust the mechanism of the unhindered formation and expression of the interests and will of all classes and social groups, their coordination and realization in the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet state. **********Fourth, the conditions must be created for the further free development of every nation and nationality, for the strengthening of their friendship and equitable cooperation on the principles of internationalism. **********Fifth, socialist legality, law and order, must be radically strengthened so as to rule out any possibility of power being usurped or abused, so as effectively to counter bureaucracy and formalism, and reliably guarantee the protection of citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, and also the execution of their duties with respect to society and the state. **********Sixth, there must be a strict demarcation of the functions of party and state bodies, in conformity with Lenin's conception of the Communist Party as a political vanguard of society and the role of the Soviet state as an instrument of government by the people. **********Finally, seventh, an effective mechanism must be established to assure the timely self-rejuvenation of the political system with due consideration for changing international and external conditions, a system capable of increasingly vigorous development and of introducing the principles of socialist democracy and self-government into all spheres of life. **********Just now it is often being said and written by people in various localities that perestroika has not reached them; they ask when this will happen. But perestroika is not manna from the skies - instead of waiting for it to be brought in from somewhere, it has to be brought about by the people themselves in their town or village, in their work collective. What are needed today more than ever are deeds, actions, not talk about perestroika. much here depends on our personnel, on leaders at the district, town, region, republic and all-union level. **********But it is not leaders alone who are to blame for the fact that we still have plenty of places where perestroika is riding at anchor. Pointing an accusing finger at the people in charge is known to be the easiest thing to do and it is a very widespread thing with us. This habit could be somehow understood when the social atmosphere in the country, and the activities of party and state bodies, were not creating the proper groundwork for people to take an active civic stand. But now, comrades, everything is changing radically, and many people have joined energetically in all the processes of perestroika. Therefore, we must put a blunt question to people who persist in complaining and pointing a finger at those in charge, at the ''higher-ups'': what have you yourself done for perestroika? **********I would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter. The implementation of these freedoms is a real guarantee that any problem of public interest will be discussed from every angle, and all the pros and cons will be weighed, and that this will help to find optimal solutions with due consideration for all the diverse opinions and actual possibilities. In short, comrades, what we are talking about is a new role of public opinion in the country. And there is no need to fear the novel, unconventional character of some opinions, there is no need to overreact and lapse into extremes at every turn of the debates. **********I also want to touch upon such a fundamental matter as freedom of conscience, which is very much in the public eye just now in connection with the millennium of the introduction of Christianity in Russia. We do not conceal our attitude to the religious outlook as being nonmaterialistic and unscientific. But this is no reason for a disrespectful attitude to the spiritual-mindedness of the believer, still less for applying any administrative pressure to assert materialistic views. . . . **********All believers, irrespective of the religion they profess, are full-fledged citizens of the U.S.S.R. The overwhelming majority of them take an active part in our industrial and civic life, in solving the problems of perestroika. The law on freedom of conscience now being drafted is based on Lenin's principles and takes into consideration all the realities of the present day. **********Now about the personal rights of citizens. Here, too, there is a need for more precise legislative regulation. Something has already been accomplished. There was deep satisfaction at the decision not to consider unsigned poison pen letters, at the establishment of criminal liability for victimizing people for criticism, at the procedure for taking officials to court for illegal actions and compensation for damages caused by such actions and at measures providing greater protection of the rights of the mentally ill. Our entire legal system is designed to guarantee strict observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy of telephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence. The law must reliably protect a person's dignity. **********One more problem. The assertion of personal rights and freedoms, and the expansion of democracy and glasnost in general, must proceed hand in hand with the reinforcement of legality and the inculcation of an absolute respect for the law. Democracy is incompatible either with wantonness, or with irresponsibility, or with permissiveness. **********As you know, we have lately more than once encountered attempts to use democratic rights for undemocratic purposes. there are some who think that in this way any problems can be solved - from redrawing boundaries to setting up opposition parties. The C.P.S.U. Central Committee considers that such abuses of democratization are fundamentally at variance with the aims of perestroika and run counter to the people's interests.  Authority of the Soviets **********We are facing the pressing task of restoring the full authority of the soviets of people's deputies, and half-measures just won't do. We've got to tackle the problem in an integral way and devise a cardinal solution. **********The discussion held before the conference has shown that the measures suggested by the Central Committee for restructuring the soviets have won support and approval. The underlying principle can be formulated as follows: not a single question concerning the state, the economy or the social fabric can be decided if the soviets are bypassed. The party's economic, social and ethnic policy should be carried out above all via the soviets of people's deputies as the organs of popular government. **********The need has fully matured to reorganize the management of local affairs along the lines of self-government, self-financing and self-sufficiency. **********This reorganization is to follow up logically on our economic reform, correlate and combine the interests of all society with the requirements of each of its territorial units and each work collective, and put an end to the departmental isolation and fragmentation of local economic structures. We should assert the full and independent authority of the soviets in managing the development of the areas they run, and economic enterprises, no matter what their superior agency, should contribute a bigger share of their profits to the budget of the soviets.  Limits on Service **********It is also time we introduced a number of democratic restrictions on the duration of service in elective offices. Our past record shows that the absence of these restrictions was a prime cause of abuses of power both centrally and locally. We have witnessed many respectable and able leaders exhaust their potential after serving in the same office for decades, and become a dead weight, a liability while still occupying a high-level position. **********During the discussion conducted prior to the conference, the entire party and the entire people demanded that this situation be changed - although different views were expressed. Some doubted whether the reservation about a third consecutive term in an elective office was justified even as an exception. Others maintained that a third term should be an extension possible only in the highest echelon of power. Let us discuss these proposals. **********One more point. The reference in the theses was only to elective offices. But many participants in the discussion suggested that it be extended to cover the posts whose holders were to be appointed and endorsed by the soviets. We believe that this is a valid proposal which deserves to be supported. **********The discussion also dealt with the proposal that service in an elective office be restricted by a certain age limit. To this, objections were raised by those who maintained that this would infringe on the sovereign rights of the electorate. One would venture to say that, given a broad democratization of the entire practice of forming government and management bodies, this problem is likely to lose its acuteness and to be tackled by the voters and deputies themselves through democratic procedures.  Proposals for Conference **********The C.P.S.U. Central Committee is submitting the following proposals for consideration by the conference. **********First, that representation of the working people in the top echelon of government be extended considerably. **********With this end in view, direct representation of the civic organizations incorporated into our political system should be added to the currently existing territorial representation of the entire population on the Soviet Union and the representation of our nations and nationalities on the Soviet of nationalities. Thus 1,500 deputies would be elected, as they are now, from the territorial and national districts, and approximately another 750 deputies would be elected at the congresses or at plenary sessions of the governing bodies of party, trade union, cooperative, youth, women's, veterans', academic, artistic and other organizations. . . . **********All these deputies, elected for a five-year term, would comprise a new representative supreme government body - the Congress of the U.S.S.R. People's Deputies. It would be convened annually to decide on the country's more important constitutional, political and socio-economic issues. **********The congress of people's deputies would elect from among its members a relatively small (say, 400- to 450-strong) bicameral U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet which would consider and decide all legislative, administrative and monitoring questions and direct the activities of the bodies accountable to it and of the lower-level soviets. It would be a standing supreme government body reporting to the congress of people's deputies. . . . **********Second, the work of the chambers of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet should be stepped up and their current functional anonymity ended. . . . At the same time, the Soviet of Nationalities, which represents all of the country's national entities . . . could consider issues of their economic and social development, interethnic relations, observance of relevant legislation, monitoring the activities performed by U.S.S.R. ministries and agencies and affecting the interests of republics or autonomous entities, etc. ... **********The discussion highlighted another subject that was debated vigorously - the relationship between the top party and government posts and their place within the structure of supreme authority. In this connection some believe it would be proper to return to the practice which existed under Lenin, when the leader of the party was simultaneously the head of government. Others object to any combination of party and Government posts. Still others call for the establishment of the post of President of the U.S.S.R. There is also a body of opinion which points out that the situation where the General Secretary of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee in fact acts as the country's top official runs counter to the rule-of-law concept. Many other views are expressed too. . . . **********In the opinion of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee, establishing the post of President of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet would be in line with enhancing the role played by the supreme representative bodies and by the entire system of the soviets of people's deputies, strengthening the rule-of-law basis of government and improving the representation of the Soviet Union in world affairs. It should be ruled that the President shall be elected and recalled by secret ballot by, and be fully answerable and accountable to, the Congress of the U.S.S.R. People's Deputies. Given the overall strengthening of the role played by representative bodies, the president of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet should be granted sufficiently broad state authority powers. Specifically, the President could exercise overall guidance in the drafting of legislation and of major socio-economic programs, decide on the key issues of foreign policy, defense and national security, chair the defense council, submit proposals on nominating the Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, and discharge several other duties traditionally connected with the presidency. **********We also believe that the government structure at top level should comprise a Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet which would be guided in its work by the President of the Supreme Soviet. serving on the presidium could be two senior vice presidents (one being the Chairman of the U.S.S.R. People's Central Committee), 15 vice presidents (one from each union republic), and the chairmen of the chambers, standing commissions and committees of the Supreme Soviet. . . . **********If the delegates agree, all these proposals could be articulated in a special resolution of our conference. One might say that we should not unduly delay the restructuring of the soviets. Specifically, relevant legislation could be considered in the U.S.S.R. Suprme Soviet as early as this autumn and then, after regular elections are held next spring, the all-union government bodies could be reorganized.  Soviet Legislation **********Perestroika has thrown into particularly bold relief the conservatism of our legal system, which is so far largely oriented not on democratic or economic but on command-style methods of administration and government with their numerous bans and petty regimentation. Many legal instruments currently in force in fact hinder social development. Hence the need for a reform of Soviet legislation, a reform that is to cover a broad range of legal standards, primarily those dealing ith socialist ownership, with planning and with economic, labor, fiscal, pension-associated and other relations. In renewing our legislation we should unswervingly observe the principle that everything not prohibited by law is allowed. **********The activities of the courts are of immense importance. The future of many people, the protection of their rights and the inevitability of a penalty for offenses against the law depend on the accuracy of the scale of justice. Bearing all this in mind, it is extremely important to restore Lenin's vision of the role to be played by the courts of law within the system of our democracy. We should abide strictly by the principle that judges are to be independent and guided only by the law. the election of the courts by higher-level soviets of people's deputies for a longer term - say, of 10 years - can become an effective guarantee of this principle. . . . **********Great attention should be accorded to improving the work of the militia (police). over the past two to three years, tens of thousands of Communists and Y.C.L. members - industrial workers and peasants - have joined it on recommendation of party committees and work collectives. This will help improve the interior ministry bodies in which, as we are all aware, major mistakes and, unfortunately, abuses have been committed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/06/business/finance-briefs-708588.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Anchor Glass Container Corp. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a $100 million offering of senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. *********** Joseph E.

The index of bank money market accounts, which compete with the money market mutual funds, remained unchanged at 6.05 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

But at least one expensive tradition remains inviolate at most companies: the lavish annual report. **********This year's reports, currently being mailed to shareholders, are anything but Spartan, contrary to the expectations of many report designers, public-relations executives and other experts in the wake of the stock market collapse. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission last year ruled that companies could significantly reduce the amount of information in annual reports. If anything, the market crash led many companies that had been thinking about trimming reports to conclude that 1987 wasn't the time to skimp on style or substance, the experts now say. **********''They wanted to reinforce the fact that their company was solid and sound,'' said Fraser Seitel, senior vice president for public affairs at the Chase Manhattan Bank. **********Other companies had to back off from plans to shrink their reports when the investment community protested. That was why the General Motors Corporation curtailed its plan to scale back its report to a summary, said Richard A. Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports Inc., a design firm hired by G.M. **********''There was concern that many people didn't understand what 'summary report' meant,'' said a G.M. spokesman, adding that with the summary, earnings disclosures and the 10-K report filed with the S.E.C., no vital information would have been omitted. (Only a handful of companies, including the McKesson Corporation, which pioneered the concept, have taken the summary approach.) For its part, G.M. produced a 40-page report that is among its most elaborate. It includes 17 pages of slick color photographs of its latest models. Bright, Bold and Elegant **********Like G.M., companies this year continued to use expensive, glossy paper splashed with four-color ink; bold computer-generated graphics, and dazzling photography. With its elegant black-and-white portraits of company executives, the H. J. Heinz Company's offering looks more like a museum catalog than a corporate report. **********According to Sid Cato, the Waukesha, Wis., publisher of Sid Cato's Newsletter on Annual Reports, companies spent an average of $3 a copy on their 1987 annual reports, up from $2.85 in 1986 and $2.44 in 1985. The 11,000 publicly held companies in the United States spent $5.1 billion, or an average of $463,000, to produce their 1987 reports. Wall Street Turns Somber **********This year's reports sound some new and some familiar themes. **********Those of Wall Street firms have turned noticably somber. The majestic photograph of a powerful bull on the cover of Merrill Lynch's report last year has given way to an austere sketch of a bull, the company's emblem, on this year's cover. And in an apparent attempt to soothe rattled investors, Merrill titles its report ''a tradition of trust.'' **********''Everybody's talking about security and strength of management,'' said Michael Watras, president of Corporate Graphics Inc., a New York-based design firm whose clients include Heinz, the Sara Lee Corporation, the Unysis Corporation and Bayer U.S.A. Inc. **********The reports of such manufacturing companies as Caterpillar Inc. discuss how the lower dollar has made companies more competitive against foreign rivals and caused exports to surge. Still, Caterpillar's report is modest. **********Then there are the familiar themes of years past. Companies are still preaching how every employee matters. The report of Tyson Foods Inc., the poultry processor, contains pages of photographs of beaming employees. In signed essays, employees tell why they like working for Tyson. **********Annual reports may not be immune from fads, but to hear the experts tell it, they are generally improving. The reports contain, experts say, less meaningless filler, hype, jargon and cliches. Reports are becoming more readable, and they are serving less as a vehicle to promote corporate leaders - although that is sometimes a matter of degree. Fewer Executive Photographs **********The report of the Citizens Utilities Company, based in Stamford, Conn., carried seven pictures this year of its chairman, Richard L. Rosenthal. Its 1980 report had 47 pictures of Mr. Rosenthal and six of his wife. ''If something substantial happens, he likes to show he was there,'' a company spokeswoman said. **********''The reports are getting better,'' said Jonathan Rinehart, chairman of the Ogilvy & Mather Public Relations Group, a unit of the Ogilvy Group. ''There are fewer of the outrageously opulent ego exercises. People are becoming incrementally more forthright.'' **********Like other energy companies, the Houston-based Transco Energy Company has fallen victim to the collapse in gas prices; its $75.5 million loss last year caused it to cut its dividend by half. In his letter to shareholders, however, George S. Slocum, Transco's chief operating officer, minces no words. ''Simply stated, 1987 was a difficult year,'' he wrote. **********Some companies acknowledge that results that appear stellar are, on closer inspection, not so bright. The Fleming Companies, an Oklahoma City-based food distributor, appeared to have a blockbuster year, reporting net earnings of $49.5 million, up from $26.9 million in 1986. In his opening paragraph to shareholders, R. D. Harrison, Fleming's chairman and chief executive, confesses: ''The increases in year-to-year comparisons are due more to a change in accounting for income taxes than to substantive gains in 1987.'' **********Why the general increase in candor? A growing number of executives feel they have no choice, experts on investor relations say. **********By the time an annual report comes out, they note, many corporate scandals or miscues have already been reported in the press. To deny a problem or gloss it over can insult savvy investors. **********Increasingly, companies feel that they must even disclose problems not reported in the press, experts say, noting that if the problems are subsequently revealed publicly, the executives may appear to be deceitful. **********''It is much better to say, 'We have this problem, and here's how we're dealing with it.' '' said Mr. Rinehart of Ogilvy & Mather. Deception Continues **********But not everyone takes that view to heart. Each year, Mr. Cato, the newsletter publisher, gives his ''Not-So-Artful-Dodgers'' awards to companies with the most deceptive annual reports. Although the awards for the 1987 reports have not been decided, some front-runners have emerged. **********One is the Grow Group Inc., a New York-based maker of paints, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In past years, Grow opened its annual reports with graphs and financial highlights. This year, they are nowhere to be seen, and Mr. Cato said he suspects the reason is that ''earnings fell out of bed after a great year in 1986.'' **********A company spokeswoman responded that the graphs and highlights were dropped because of a design change aimed at making the report look like a news magazine. **********The Comsat Corporation is another company vying for Mr. Cato's award. Reading most of the lengthy letter from Irving Goldstein, Comsat's chairman and chief executive, leaves the impression that Comsat's telecommunications services are booming. Not until the 22d paragraph of the 25-paragraph letter do shareholders learn that their company suffered a $47.3 million loss last year. **********''All the financial results were not a surprise to us, the financial community or the media,'' a Comsat spokesman said. ''It sounds like what you have in your hands with Mr. Cato is an art critic.'' **********Companies are not required under the securities laws to publish annual reports. The Securities and Exchange Commission says only that public companies must provide financial statements prior to annual meetings. Reading Time: Six Minutes **********If most companies are sticking with lavish reports, it remains unclear whether the money is well spent. **********A study a few years ago by Duff & Phelps, a Chicago investment firm, found that the average investor spends about six minutes reading an annual report and then files it - typically in the trash bin. A more recent study, by Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm, found that most investors believe they get better investment advice from a relative than from the reports. **********Shareholders, in short, don't believe a lot of what they read in the reports, the studies suggest. **********Recognizing as much, Pfizer Inc. trotted out a half-dozen renowned medical experts to endorse its new drugs in its 1987 report. **********''It's one thing to have us promote our new products,'' said Andrew Heath, Pfizer's director of communications. ''To corroborate that, it's good to have someone knowledgeable in the outside medical community,'' he said, adding that the experts were not paid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/02/business/company-news-first-bank-system-in-colorado-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRST BANK SYSTEM IN COLORADO DEAL", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; FIRST BANK SYSTEM IN COLORADO DEAL", "body_text": " **********First Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis has agreed to help bail out 9,000 industrial bank depositors in Colorado in return for the right to enter the state and acquire a leading bank holding company.

The official Administration figure is $146.7 billion for the current year. **********The relatively sluggish revenues come in spite of continued moderate growth of the economy, which some feared would be derailed by last fall's stock market crash, and some presumed direct benefit on tax flows from the crash itself. **********As investors disposed of stocks last fall, many of them were selling issues that had sharply appreciated and would thus be generating extra tax revenue this season from capital gains. **********''There doesn't seem to be evidence of that showing up,'' said John R. Williams, money market economist for the Bankers Trust Company. ''We're not seeing the bulge in tax receipts.'' $10 Billion Extra Last Year Last year's extra revenue, some $10 billion, appeared mainly to have resulted from sales of securities in late 1986 inspired by the new tax law, which, wiped out a preferential rate for capital gains, effective in the 1987 tax year. **********Despite revenues ''running a bit behind schedule,'' Mr. Williams said he was sticking with $150 billion as his deficit prediction for the year. **********James C. Miller 3d, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a brief interview on Wednesday that ''we're on track'' with budget goals but that it would be midmonth before he had reliable figures. He noted that interest rates had been running higher than projected, raising the cost of financing the Government's debt. **********March receipts, the Treasury statements show, were $75.8 billion this year, 11.1 percent higher than in March 1987. For February and January, the increases were 9.6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. **********There are no current plans for any deficit-reducing tax increase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Zip-Pak Inc. to Della Femina, Travisano & Partners for advertising and Creamer Dickson Basford for public relations. *********** Gerber Products Company to J.

But few are as determined as Dennis Patrick, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to find a way to keep a lid on telephone profits without deadening incentives to innovate and cut waste. **********Mr. Patrick's alternative, regulation focusing on prices rather than profits, has been used in Britain, where it has reduced phone bills by 14 percent over four years, and it could generate equivalent savings here. There is no significant interest-group opposition to the switch - most of the regulated phone companies, in fact, are supporters. Nor is it viewed as risky or impractical by the regulatory establishment: variations are being tried in 28 states, including New York. But Congressional hostility to the F.C.C. chairman and his political allies in the White House could derail his initiative. **********Under ''cost plus'' regulation, phone companies providing interstate service are allowed to set prices that cover reasonable costs, including dividends sufficient to keep investors happy. Most customers have reason to be satisfied: service is reliable and long-distance rates are down by one-third since the breakup of A.T.& T.'s monopoly in 1984. But Mr. Patrick and many other economists are not. Rapid improvements in technology and a major shift in costs from long distance to local service, they argue, have masked the inherent weaknesses in current regulation. They say savings would have been much greater if telephone companies had incentives to minimize costs. **********The F.C.C. tries to put pressure on phone companies to hold down costs and to use the best technology. As a practical matter, though, the commission is in no position to second-guess the companies' operating policies. All it can really do under the current policy is penalize the utility when the quality of service falls or profits exceed the target. **********As a result the phone companies have every incentive to ''gold plate'' their systems with extremely reliable but excessively costly equipment. And they have little incentive to root out waste, or introduce more efficient technology; any savings will end up in customers' pockets. **********Thanks to improvements in technology, costs in the federally regulated portion of the phone business have been falling at about 2.5 percent annually. With the right incentives, Mr. Patrick says, the companies should be able to do much better over the next four years. Under the ''price cap'' approach, phone companies would have considerable flexibility in setting the prices for individual services as long as average prices, adjusted for inflation, fell by at least 3 percent annually. In return, the companies could keep the fruits of any additional cost reductions. **********The extra half percent gain in productivity would save consumers about $1.6 billion in four years. The commission would still keep track of phone company profits, and if it appeared the phone companies could do even better than 3 percent, the required rate reduction would be increased. **********The potential political bombs in the proposal have been defused by limiting the companies' ability to adjust some prices. They would not be allowed, for instance, to reduce long-distance rates between cities while raising charges for rural customers. In fact, no rate could go up or down by more than 5 percent annually without specific justification. **********Why, then, has the proposal been greeted so coolly on Capitol Hill? Partly because Congress was burned by the political fallout from the breakup of Ma Bell and is eager to duck further controversy over telephone regulation. Partly because legislators are suspicious of any regulatory change that has the support of the regulated. Mostly, though, because Mr. Patrick and the Reagan Administration angered key Democrats by engineering the repeal of the F.C.C.'s Fairness Doctrine, the requirement that broadcasters air contrasting viewpoints on political issues. **********The F.C.C. chairman does not need explicit Congressional approval for rate-cap regulation. But he does need support from a majority on the commission, and Congress is not about to help him. Two of the commission's five seats, set aside by statute for Republicans, are vacant. The Reagan Administration nominated replacements last fall, but Senate Democrats have yet to examine their credentials. Thus Mr. Patrick must win the approval of one of the two Democrats who serve with him. **********Commissioners Patricia Diaz Dennis and James Quello are Reagan appointees and both supported repeal of the Fairness Doctrine last year. But they have strong ties to Congressional Democrats, and may be reluctant to vote for any major change in regulation proposed by Mr. Patrick in the twilight months of the Reagan Administration. Price-cap regulation, which has no real enemies, may languish for lack of friends in the right places."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/18/business/ontario-defiance-threatens-canada-us-pact-on-trade.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1988-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ontario Defiance Threatens Canada-U.S. Pact on Trade", "print_headline": "Ontario Defiance Threatens Canada-U.S. Pact on Trade", "body_text": " **********The Canadian Government appears to have failed in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Province of Ontario to comply with the free-trade agreement reached last year with the United States. **********Its failure could threaten putting the treaty into effect, which is scheduled to take place on Jan. 1, if approved by the United States Congress. **********Ontario's Premier, David Peterson, told reporters today that the free-trade pact was dead if it required Ontario's approval. Although the provincial legislatures do not have to approve the pact, some portions of it reguire legislation to put it into effect. **********Mr. Peterson also said that Ontario was considering a court action that would block the national Government's ability to force compliance by the provinces. **********Court precedents on that issue are unclear, but Canada's Supreme Court, in a 1937 ruling that is considered a landmark in matters of conflicting Federal and provincial jurisdiction, held that Ottawa's power to conclude international treaties did not give it the right to overrule the provinces in areas of their own jurisdiction. **********The immediate point of dispute between Ontario and the national Government is Ontario's refusal to end its practice of placing discriminatory markups on American and European wines in provincially owned liquor stores, in order to protect the province's small wine and grape industry. **********Although many economists believe that Ontario's industries will gain under the free-trade agreement, Mr. Peterson appears to have chosen the dispute over wine to vent his broader concerns. **********The Ontario Premier, a Liberal, has said that the pact undermines Canadian sovereignty in economic matters and makes unjustifiable concessions to the United States in matters such as energy trade. **********Mr. Peterson made his comments in discussing his meeting in Toronto on Monday with Canada's Trade Minister, John Crosbie, at which Mr. Crosbie sought a way around Ontario's opposition to the pact. Ontario has objected to provisions in the pact that would oblige the province to eliminate price markups that discriminate in favor of Ontario wines and against imports, including those from the United States. **********Mr. Crosbie has been touring the provinces, seeking support. Only the smallest province, Prince Edward Island, has joined Ontario in opposing the pact. Push for Legislation Vowed **********In Ottawa today, Mr. Crosbie vowed to press ahead with legislation putting the pact into effect despite Ontario's opposition, but he excoriated Mr. Peterson for his stand, saying, ''It's too bad that one province chooses to set itself above the rest of the country.'' **********For his part, Mr. Peterson seemed undaunted by the prospect of a court fight. ''I don't think anybody reasonable could have expected me to put my signature on the document and say, 'It's wonderful,' when I think it's flawed in many, many areas,'' he said. **********The dispute between Ottawa and Ontario, which accounts for more than a third of Canada's population of 25 million and about 40 percent of its manufacturing trade, could derail the trade agreement altogether. Certification Required **********In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee, which is considering the legislation that would put the agreement into effect, approved a provision on Monday that would require President Reagan to certify that Canada will be able to assure compliance of all 10 provinces before the agreement can take effect. **********In Parliament this afternoon, the Senate panel's action caused an uproar among the opposition parties, which have vowed to abrogate the pact if they defeat the ruling Conservatives in an election expected in the next year. **********John Turner, the Liberal Party leader, said: ''It's one thing for us Canadians to disagree among ourselves about how we should operate. It's another thing to allow another country to dictate how we should conduct our internal affairs.'' Smoldering Since Fall **********The dispute with Ontario has been smoldering since the fall, when Mr. Peterson won a landslide victory in a provincial election after pledging to oppose the free-trade pact. When the agreement between Ottawa and Washington was reached a month after the election, Mr. Peterson appeared to backpedal, saying there were limits to what Ontario could do to block the agreement. **********According to studies by some Canadian supporters of the agreement, Ontario's industries stand among those gaining the most from the pact, which would eliminate all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10-year period. **********To insure the survival of Ontario's small wine industry, and the grape growers, mainly in the Niagara Peninsula, who depend on the industry, Ontario has long followed the practice of discriminatory price markups in provincially operated liquor stores. The stores the only outlets licensed to sell wine at retail and the markups can add $3 or $4 a bottle to the price of medium-priced California and European wines, compared with the dollar or less that is imposed on Ontario's products. Other Provinces Will Comply **********Similar practices are followed by other provinces, including British Columbia, that support the trade deal and have indicated that they will comply with its provisions. **********Although marginal in terms of the $150 billion of trade in goods and services that passes between Canada and the United States each year, the discrimination against American wines became an important point for negotiators after President Reagan singled it out as an issue that required attention when he visited Ottawa last year. **********Ottawa had hoped that Ontario would agree to a formula in the Canadian legislation to be introduced in Parliament later this month that would put the agreement into effect. Under this formula Ottawa would apparently assert its authority to override provincial jurisdiction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/world/seoul-seeks-un-help-in-rift-with-north.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1988-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Seeks U.N.

Neither South or North Korea is a member of the United Nations, but both have observer missions there. **********In an hourlong interview in the Blue House, his residence here, he discussed the foreign and domestic challenges that face his nation now that the Seoul Olympics have ended. Many Koreans had been reserving judgment on Mr. Roh until after the Olympics, which served as a check on both the Government and the opposition. **********''What we would like the United Nations to do, as a neutral third party, is use its good offices as a mediator,'' he said this afternoon. ''Sometimes direct parties cannot agree because of mistrust and pride. Just as in marriage counseling, we need a third party to arrange a satisfactory solution.'' **********Mr. Roh is to meet with President Reagan on Thursday in Washington. His visit, the first since he took office in February, comes as relations between the two nations have been questioned in Korea. **********A growing Korean national pride, fed by the Olympics, is prompting resentment over American pressure to open South Korean markets to American goods. Moreover, many Koreans chafe at the continuing presence of American military installations in downtown Seoul, and what many Koreans see as American arrogance. **********At the same time, the Government is courting Communist nations it once considered enemies, as well as trying to improve relations with North Korea. During the Olympics, many South Koreans booed American athletes and cheered those from Communist countries. **********While Mr. Roh acknowledged anti-American sentiment, he said the two nations would remain close and ill feelings would dissipate. ''Two people quarrel when they are very close,'' he said. ''Brothers fight. You do not fight with those who are further apart. The Korean public has trusted and depended on American friendship. If their expectations are not met, they are more disappointed.'' **********Mr. Roh has made a priority of improving relations with the North. While the two Koreas should continue to make efforts to resolve their own affairs, he said, the United Nations could also play an important role in bringing them closer together. **********In July, Mr. Roh (his name sounds closer to ''no'' than Roh in Korean) announced a dramatic shift in policy toward North Korea intended to promote trade and personal exchanges between the two nations and end the North's diplomatic isolation. **********After a flurry of counterproposals by the North, the two sides embarked in August on their first talks in nearly three years. So far they have failed to agree on terms for a joint parliamentary meeting, but will talk again in November. While the South proposes building good will through family visits, trade and citizens' exchanges, the North wants a pledge of nonaggression and the eventual withdrawal of American troops.  [ North Korea welcomed Seoul's newest offer, Reuters quoted the nation's Central News Agency as saying. But the North Koreans also said Seoul must repeal its anti-Communist law before negotiations take place. ]  Role for Other Countries Mr. Roh said he would not specifically appeal for direct negotiations to be undertaken by United Nations officials such as the ones that produced cease-fires in Afghanistan and in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Iraq. But he suggested that he would be willing to accept any help in reaching out to North Korea - either from the United Nations or from member countries who have relations with North Korea or have security interests on the Korean peninsula. **********''The United Nations has earned the respect of the international community by assisting in the solution of international disputes,'' he said. ''Based on this, I think the United Nations can find some role by itself in the Korea question. Other countries individually can also play some role.'' **********His aides said he would appeal to nations with security interests in the peninsula - presumably the United States, China and the Soviet Union - to help promote talks between the Koreas. The surge of anti-Americanism, he said, springs both from South Korea's new freedom of expression and from changes in its relationship with the United States. **********''Some people do not yet understand we have reached a very horizontal relationship, instead of the traditional vertical relationship with the United States - especially students do not understand this,'' he said, referring to a relationship among equals instead of the former one where the United States had a dominant role. ''But the trends toward democracy and development of a free market will proceed to make this very meaningless, and within a short time we will be able to overcome these difficulties.'' **********The next several months will test not only Mr. Roh's foreign policy, but his commitment to change at home as well. His accommodating manner and his deliberate rejection of his predecessor's imperious style have won him measured praise even from opposition leaders. But many Koreans, made cautious by a history of brief spells of freedom followed by coups, will be closely watching post-Olympic politics. **********South Korean politics remain haunted by the past, and it is the examination of that past that will help shape the future. The opposition-controlled legislature, elected in April with new powers, has begun investigations into charges of corruption and abuses of power during the Government of former President Chun Doo Hwan. **********In just one example, newspapers have begun printing articles about ''re-education camps,'' where the Chun Government sent vagrants as well as some political dissidents for forced labor and political training. At least 50 people are reported to have died in these camps. **********Such investigations are potentially explosive because they could implicate senior Government and military officials and may serve to remind the public of the close links between Mr. Roh and Mr. Chun - his predecessor, former ally and close friend. President Roh has taken great pains to distance himself from a past he helped to shape without completely breaking with Mr. Chun, who picked him as his successor. **********Ruling party politicians have urged Mr. Roh to ask Mr. Chun to answer questions before the National Assembly and to issue an apology for any past misdeeds. Today Mr. Roh said the Government would cooperate. **********Mr. Roh dismissed fears that the investigations could touch off a political crisis and a return to authoritarianism. He pointed to a number of democratic changes that have already taken place in little more than a year - the nation's first direct presidential election in 16 years, its first opposition-controlled legislature, substantially increased press freedoms and a better human rights record. His critics assert that a number of political prisoners remain in jail and that many released have not yet been allowed to vote or take part in politics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/business/morgan-stanley-profit-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Morgan Stanley Profit Off", "print_headline": "Morgan Stanley Profit Off", "body_text": " **********The Morgan Stanley Group's profits fell 28 percent in the third quarter, the company said yesterday, pointing to a falloff in underwriting and commission income that was only partly offset by strong mergers and acquisition activity. **********The company, a leading international securities firm, reported profits of $52.4 million, or $1.96 a share, down from $72.9 million, or $2.82 a share, in the corresponding quarter of 1987.

It was the third time that Mr. Goria had quit since taking office almost eight months ago, but this time his departure seemed final. **********The sudden but not entirely unexpected collapse of the Government heralded a long-awaited political reshuffling. A variety of political figures expressed alarm that the search for a more stable Government would come amid an atmosphere of sharp disagreement and political opportunism. **********The Socialists and their allies, the Social Democrats, abstained Thursday when the Cabinet voted to endorse Mr. Goria's decision to resume the construction of a nuclear power plant north of Rome. Today the Socialists issued a blistering attack on the Government, asserting that the decision by the Cabinet ''had no value'' because Mr. Goria, a Christian Democrat, had grossly overstepped his political authority with ''a forced and inexplicable initiative.'' The youngest man to govern postwar Italy, Mr. Goria, 44 years old, came to office last June after a general election that produced no clear winner in the prolonged joust between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. When the two major political parties were unable to find the basis for a strong alliance, Mr. Goria, a man with no power base, was chosen to head the Government in what was viewed as an interim appointment. **********Both in November and in February, Mr. Goria resigned when he ran into trouble trying to enact basic tax and budget provisions.

But his move to step down was hastened by the readiness of the Socialists to pull out of the Government over the issue of the nuclear plant. **********Many of Mr. Goria's difficulties arose from the disorder within his party.

They argue that its circulation would lead to violence among India's 80 million or more Moslems. **********Two chapters of the work, a characteristic Rushdie fantasy with elements of surrealism and hallucinatory imagery, have been the focus of Islamic ire. Both deal with a character called Mahound, assumed to be Mohammed. One, ''Return to Jahilia,'' casts the Prophet's 12 wives as prostitutes in a brothel, the critics say - a characterization Mr. Rushdie rejects. **********Since the ban was announced, an outcry has been rising not only here in India, where scholars and writers are arguing against the peremptory nature of the Government action, but also in Britain, where Mr. Rushdie now lives. The book is scheduled to be published in the United States in February by Viking. No Hearing Held **********There was no official review or hearing on the merits of the case before the Finance Ministry barred the importation or sale of the book under customs legislation. **********''The idea that the Minister of Finance should decide what books should be read and not be read is not acceptable in a free country,'' Mr. Rushdie said in an interview by telephone from his home in London. He called on Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to assert his authority and reverse the ban. **********''It seems to me that the Government has grown very weak in India while the power of religious extremists seems to have grown very strong,'' Mr. Rusdie said. ''The book is not the issue. This is an attempt to manipulate the Government.'' **********Many Indians have also characterized the action as a sign of Government weakness, noting that it follows by only a few weeks Prime Minister Gandhi's hasty withdrawal of a new defamation law that had aroused protests. The book ban is widely regarded as a move that can only end in another embarrassing reversal. Even if the ban remains in force, pirated copies of the book are expected to be circulating soon in large numbers. **********Penguin India, the local affiliate of Viking, declined to publish it here, but copies have been imported. A 'Comic Novel' **********Mr. Rushdie, who was born into a Moslem family in Bombay and studied Islamic history at Cambridge University, said he was ''no longer a formally religious person.'' **********''But Islamic culture is the one in which I grew up, and I always wanted to write about it,'' he said. He described his book, which has been nominated for a Booker Prize, Britain's highest literary award, as a ''comic novel,'' which nonetheless deals with serious issues of cultural and spiritual dislocation - a novel about change and metamorphosis. **********''It is about Islamic culture seen against a basically Western background,'' he said. **********New Delhi's pre-emptive action, taken as the book was beginning to arrive for sale in India, floodlights the gap between the sophisticated national image fostered by the Government of Prime Minister Gandhi and the powerful forces of religious fundamentalism that still motivate millions of Indians: Hindus, Sikhs and Moslems. To sustain itself, the Government needs votes in all those camps. **********The ban also highlights a collision of cultures not uncommon in Asian nations struggling to set acceptable limits of ''Westernization.'' **********''When I look at Western civilization, to my mind it appears that the West has lost the line of distinction between the sacred and the profane,'' Sayed Shahabuddin, the Indian Moslem at the center of the controversy, said in an interview here. ''For the evolution of human culture, you have to regard some things as sacred. Otherwise the spirit will not prosper.'' **********''I may not share your opinion or your faith,'' he said. ''But I don't have to treat it contemptuously or in an indecent manner.'' Book 'Filthily Abusive' **********It was Mr. Shahabuddin, a former Indian diplomat and now a Member of Parliament for the opposition Janata Party and editor of the magazine Muslim India, who by his own account first brought the Rushdie book to the attention of the Government, and then persisted with his case until he obtained the ban. **********He acknowledges that he did not -and would not - read the book, which he calls ''filthily abusive.'' But after receiving letters and telegrams from Moslems all over India beginning in late September, Mr. Shahbuddin said, he began to collect accounts of the book and comments made about it by Mr. Rushdie. **********''By these interviews it becomes clear what the book is about, because Salman Rushdie does not make any bones about it,'' Mr. Shahabuddin said. ''He in fact brags that he majored in Islam at university and knows all about it. As far as he is concerned, he does not believe Mohammed was the true Prophet.'' **********Mr. Rushdie says these are falsifications of his work and its intent. Mr. Shahabuddin remains unconvinced. **********''You must look at this in the context of how the Moslem regards the Prophet,'' Mr. Shahabuddin said. ''As far as the Moslems are concerned, there is no divinity about the man. He is a man. But he is the messenger of God, and the entire Islamic faith is based on this notion: that he is the Prophet and that what you find in the Koran is the word of God.'' **********''We also regard the Prophet's own life as the model for the rest of humanity, and for all times,'' he went on. ''To a believing Moslem, you may jest about a lot - but you cannot jest about the person of the prophet.'' 'This Sorry Episode' **********Editorial opinion in India, where almost every newspaper has entered the debate on the ban, has been largely careful to accept that the danger of Moslem violence is always very real in a country where even a rumor of a slight or an abuse can turn loose a mob. **********But some writers have argued that the onus should be on the Moslem political leaders to defuse these tendencies, not pander to them. **********''It is these very politicians who will emerge as the biggest losers in this sorry episode,'' The Times of India said Saturday. ''For they have once again demonstrated their inability or unwillingness or both to convince their community not to be swayed by writings such as Mr. Rushdie's. The result is that prejudices against the minority can only gain in strength, even as the banned novel draws more readers to it than would have been the case otherwise.'' **********Reflecting the opinion of many Indian writers, publishers and academics, The Times of India said ''The Satanic Verses'' was ''an outstanding literary achievement'' meriting respect ''regardless of the deplorable ban and the bigotry that provoked it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/02/world/us-escorts-gulf-tankers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Escorts Gulf Tankers", "print_headline": "U.S. Escorts Gulf Tankers", "body_text": " **********United States warships escorted three Kuwaiti oil tankers northward through the Persian Gulf today after reports that Iranian gunboats were sighted near the Strait of Hormuz, maritime officials said.

''We hope and trust that there will be a long transition period.'' **********Dutch diplomats estimate with pride that more than a quarter of a million Soviet Jews have passed through their portals to the West since Moscow broke diplomatic relations over the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. #1,500 Jews a Month Are Leaving In the last year, the number has been growing and is nearing 1,500 a month. In addition, the authorities have begun permitting substantial numbers of Jews, about 1,000 in May, to visit relatives in Israel. **********The Dutch Embassy is such an important institution for these Soviet Jews that in many Soviet cities would-be emigres circulate homemade guides describing embassy procedures, listing hard-to-find home phone numbers of Dutch diplomats, and describing the etiquette and proper frame of mind for the wait on Kalashny Lane. **********''Take your time, behave with dignity,'' advises a bulletin distributed in Odessa.

''Leave them for the refuseniks.'' **********''For the refusenik community, that embassy is a stronghold of hope and support,'' said Tatyana Zieman, who has been waiting 11 years for permission to leave the country. ''And not only the refuseniks, all of the human rights cases. It's just absolutely extraordinary the way they make you feel.'' **********The protectiveness toward the desperate, which the Soviets often take as irritating political gamesmanship when practiced by Americans, is accepted in the Dutch as a sign of the national compassion associated in world memory with Anne Frank's attic. New Element of Uncertainty **********The arrival of the Israeli delegation, expected in July has introduced a new element of uncertainty. **********Most Soviet emigres fly from Moscow to Vienna. There, rather than continue to Israel, 9 out of 10 claim the American refugee status that is automatically available to Soviet emigres, and go to the United States. **********In the last year, the Soviet authorities have begun permitting a trickle of Soviet Jews to leave with American visas. But the idea of repatriating Jews to their homeland is more tolerable to Soviet pride than the notion of Soviet citizens bolting for the more affluent life in America. **********Earlier this year Soviet Jews began receiving invitations to Israel stipulating that they must travel via Bucharest, Rumania, where they would have no opportunity to change destinations. Once in Israel, a Soviet Jew must wait years for entry into the United States. **********Many suspect that the Israeli delegation, which is ostensibly coming to inspect the Dutch consular outpost and the former Israeli Embassy building that was shut in 1967, will begin enforcing the Bucharest route. **********''For a lot of people that would be a problem, because Israel is essentially at war,'' said Oleg Yampolsky, a photographer from the city of Gorky who came to Kalashny Lane on Tuesday morning to collect his Israeli visa.

For some companies, this accounting change could reduce net income by a staggering 25 percent or more, some consultants say. **********''In the next year I would expect to see most medium-size to large companies tighten up their retirement medical plans significantly,'' said Robert A. Moreen, senior vice president in Philadelphia for Hay/Huggins, a benefits consulting firm. **********For the employer, the annual saving could be millions or even tens of millions of dollars. For some retirees, the extra expense could be hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. The changes could be even more painful if medical bills continue to rise. And they could particularly affect employees who retire before Medicare coverage kicks in at age 65 or who did not begin working for the company until mid-career. **********This prospect troubles groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, which says that one in six retirees over 65 and one in four of all retirees currently has some sort of employer health benefit. Tax Incentives Proposed **********The association is calling for tax incentives to encourage employers to set aside money for retirees' medical benefits and for vesting standards to assure that employees are guaranteed the benefits even if they leave the company before they retire. **********Most large companies still pick up all or almost all of retirees' medical expenses that Medicare does not, no matter what the price, and they will not publicly acknowledge formulating any plans to limit their liability. But benefits consultants in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, San Francisco and Washington say they have been working with companies that have been studying such changes. **********Among the actions being considered by many employers is paying a smaller part of the medical premium for early or shorter-service retirees. For example, the employer would contribute only half as much for someone who spent 10 years at the company as for a 20-year employee. **********The annual cost of a medical insurance plan for a retired person and spouse typically ranges from $2,800 to $4,000 for a retiree under 65 and $1,200 to $2,000 for one over 65 who has help from Medicare, said Steven J. Ferruggia, director of group actuarial practice at Buck Consultants in Secaucus, N.J. Many employers now paying the entire amount may soon ask shorter-service employees to pay half, he said. Effect on Retiree's Wallet **********Medicare covers more than the employer does for retirees over 65. Now some companies, deciding they will no longer cover everything that Medicare does not, may introduce or raise premiums, deductibles and co-payments. As a result, Mr. Moreen said, in a typical case a retired person who once would owe nothing on an $8,500 medical bill could soon owe $1,500. **********At least two employers with a total of more than 60,000 employees, TRW Inc. and the Pillsbury Company, have made even more dramatic moves to limit their health care liability. They have decided that instead of guaranteeing a certain level of medical benefits, they will assure only a certain dollar contribution to the premiums paid for a retiree's health plan, just as they do with pensions. Right now the amount is usually high enough that the retiree owes no premium or at least no extra premium. But if the cost of medical plans rises sharply in coming years, as most people expect, and if the company does not increase its contribution just as sharply, the retiree will have to pay more. **********The TRW plan, which does not affect current retirees, took effect Aug. 1 and will affect 50,000 workers when they retire. How TRW Plan Will Work **********Under the plan, the company's maximum contribution to a health plan premium in the first year would be $160 a month for a retiree not yet eligible for Medicare and $65 for one who is (the amount is doubled if the retired worker has a spouse or dependent). A retiree who had served 20 years would qualify for the full contribution, a 10-year worker for half. **********In each succeeding year, TRW's contribution to the premium can rise by only 50 percent of the medical care cost component of the Consumer Price Index - and only up to 4 percent. That means the retiree will owe more and more as time passes. **********''We wanted to get control of the dollars,'' said John K. McMahon, director of employee benefits at TRW. ''That doesn't necessarily mean we won't spend money, but it gives us control.'' **********At Pillsbury, more than 12,000 salaried employees are granted one ''total value'' credit - currently $1,400 for each year of service or a total of $28,000 for a 20-year employee. Based on this amount, they are given a yearly annuity with which they can buy various health plans. **********Limitations like those at TRW and Pillsbury stir expressions of concern from the American Association of Retired Persons. Biggest Risk for Individual **********''It leaves the individual bearing the biggest risk,'' said Judy Schub, a coordinator for the association's Federal affairs economics team. ''It also may remove some of the cost-containment pressure that large employers have been exerting on providers, and I'm afraid of losing that.'' **********She fears that if the employers' own liability is capped, they will not have as strong an incentive to bargain with doctors and hospitals to hold down costs. **********While many companies have been slow to adopt changes like those at TRW and Pillsbury, the pace may soon speed up because of an approaching change in accounting rules, consultants say. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private organization that creates the rules accountants follow, is expected to issue a proposal within two months that would force companies eventually to treat more retiree medical obligations as a current expense. **********Companies now must account only for what they pay out for current retirees. Under the proposed change, which could take effect in 1992, they would have to project post-retirement medical costs for a future retiree and account for them while the employee is still working, just as they do for pension obligations. Projection of Extra Cost **********The extra cost will be enormous, said Rich Ostuw, a vice president in Cleveland for TPF&C, a consulting arm of Towers, Perrin. **********''For a typical large company today,'' he said, ''the cost of post-retirement medical benefits is about $300 per active employee annually, or roughly 1 percent of payroll. Under the expected F.A.S.B. rules, that would change to about $2,600, even with the improvement in Medicare catastrophic care coverage approved this summer.'' That legislation, the first major expansion of the Medicare program, provides additional coverage for catastrophic illnesses. **********''Now consider the average profit per employee, based on the Fortune 500 industrial companies,'' Mr. Ostuw said. ''It was roughly $8,000. So $300 is a pretty small percentage of company profits, but $2,600 is pretty big. All told, we expect that for a typical large company the change in accounting rules will reduce profits by about 25 percent. **********''Many companies will say, 'We overcommitted in the past because we did not understand what the long-term costs would be for the benefits we promised, and we must make a correction now.' '' **********Mr. Ostuw added that in the long run an employer could cut the increase in its expenses in half - from $2,300 per employee to $1,150 in the example just given - by redesigning its plan in such ways as providing only a defined dollar amount. For a large employer, that could mean a saving of millions or even tens of millions of dollars. Different From Pensions **********A few companies may even move to drop their retiree medical obligations altogether. One problem, benefits consultants say, is that companies do not receive the tax advantages for the money they set aside for such benefits that they do for pension money, said Deborah Chollet of the Employee Benefits Research Institute in Washington. Partly because of this, few employers have such funds for medical benefits. **********''If we want to encourage the continuation of employers providing medical benefits for retirees we will have to give them some favorable tax status on pre-funding them,'' said Bruce E. Noda, a principal in San Francisco for Mercer Meidinger Hansen. **********But Congress has not been very receptive to such changes or to changes sought by the retired persons' association, said Gary Christopherson, director of health legislation for the House Select Committee on Aging. ''Anything you do may hurt as much as it helps,'' he said. Tax incentives would reduce Government revenue at a time of huge deficits, he said, and employers would resist new controls like vesting requirements that would force them to pay more for retiree medical benefits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/business/briefs-232688.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 334, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Advanced Micro Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., said it would close its Sunnyvale manufacturing facility at the end of the year. *********** Deutsche Lufthansa A.G., Frankfurt, said it would order two Boeing 747-400 jets and exercise options to buy five Boeing 737-300 jets. *********** H.J.

Wall Street, of course, is famous for finding bright spots amid calamity. **********But Mr. Sweeney argues that chicken prices -and thus the stocks of chicken producers - were headed up cyclically anyway. The drought, in effect, is merely the gravy. **********Chicken prices and production rise and fall in inverse proportion to each other in three-year cycles, Mr. Sweeney said. These financial cycles, he added, are created by the tendency of producers to increase flocks after a natural disaster and by the breeding cycles of the birds themselves. The last natural disaster, he noted, was the 1986 heat wave, which killed millions of chickens. **********Now, he said, production is slowing and the price of chickens is rising in an 18-month leg that began in January. The reverse 18-month leg - falling prices and rising production - would then complete the three-year cycle. **********''The price of Georgia Dock Wholesale broilers has risen from 40 cents a pound in December to 68 cents this week,'' he said, citing a common benchmark price. **********The current drought is not killing so many chickens, he noted, but it has made feed scarcer and more costly. Those and other factors mean that chickens will be smaller and leaner. **********Aside from the drought and breeding cycles, there are other reasons why many analysts like poultry companies. **********For one thing, there is America's growing love affair with the chicken. **********Health-conscious consumers have been eating less red meat. Since fish often carries filet mignon-like prices, chicken-eating has really taken off. Many restaurants, including those in giant fast-food chains, now prominently offer chicken. And chicken fingers and spicy Buffalo chicken wings are now standard yuppie fare at many bistros. **********Chicken also has a marketing advantage. There is not yet a fish-world equivalent of the chicken super star Frank Perdue, who is credited with helping the entire poultry industry get out of the hen house. **********Chicken even rates its own rumor on Wall Street: Some stock traders say they have heard that McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, is about to offer a new chicken product and has been buying chickens as if they were going out of style. **********For its part, McDonald's denies that it is trying to corner the chicken market. John Onoda, a spokesman, said the company was indeed testing a new chicken product, the McChicken sandwich, in certain areas of the country, but ''we're not buying up any chickens.'' He said that the McChicken test was widely known and that McDonald's was buying the normal number of chicken parts from its regular suppliers. **********But assuming that there is a chicken supply-demand squeeze, how can individual investors play fowl? Well, there are plenty of choices, although they do not include Mr. Perdue's company. The man who brought chickens to the public has not gone public. **********Mr. Sweeney likes Holly Farms, now selling at about $40 a share, and Conagra, now at $30. Both are in his fund's portfolio, and despite their recent run-ups he expects them to move sharply higher. **********Holly, he said, is the purer commodity play. ''If you want to partcipate in broilers, you buy something like Holly Farms,'' he said. ''It happens so fast. It's like buying Phelps-Dodge and then the price of copper goes up.'' **********Mr. Sweeney said Holly earned $1.77 a share in the fiscal year ended May 31, down sharply from the prior year's $4.31. But he predicts that the poultry price upswing cycle will mean earnings of $6 to $7 a share in the present fiscal year. **********Conagra is a more diversified company, he said, which is why its earnings of $1.94 a share in its latest fiscal year, also ended May 31, were slightly better than $1.85 the year before. ''The rest of Conagra was doing brilliantly'' and carried the chicken operations, he said. He predicts that a rebound in the poultry operations will push Conagra's earnings to $3 a share in the fiscal year ending next May. **********Mr. Sweeney also suggests Hudson Foods, which is now at $10 a share; Cagle Inc., now at $7.50; Golden Poultry, now at $8; Pilgrim's Pride, now at $6.50, and Tyson, now at $19.75. He also likes Seaboard, a thinly traded issue that is at $113 a share. ''They have lots of chickens per share,'' he noted. Not everyone is convinced by the chicken argument. One trader, who asked not to be named, pointed out that many of the poultry stocks had already risen sharply in the last two months and suggested that the chickens may already be out of the barn door, speculatively speaking. **********''It's too late now,'' he said. ''Holly Farms has already gone from $30 to $40. The train has left town.'' **********Other analysts commented that droughts and other national calamities hurt investor psyches and sometimes depress stock prices in general even if they help some companies' bottom lines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/02/business/china-s-growing-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China's Growing Debt", "print_headline": "China's Growing Debt", "body_text": " **********China said today that it did not face a debt crisis but admitted that its debt had grown too fast and needed better management.

These services could include video telephones; high-definition television; video on demand, allowing users to select cable television movies by phone; home shopping and banking, and various videotex services. **********The commission also said the move would extend cable service to areas where it is economically infeasible for an independent company to operate. **********The ownership restrictions, which were adopted in 1971 and included in the Cable Act of 1984, are intended to prevent anti-competitive abuses by telephone companies, which hold a local monopoly on telephone service. **********In making its recommendation, the F.C.C. said that the cable television industry had grown until cable companies were providing service to about 80 percent of the nation's homes and that telephone companies were no longer in a position to eliminate competition from independent cable operators. **********Congressional staff members, however, said legislators remained concerned about an opportunity for telephone companies to engage in predatory activities. For example, phone companies might use their control over access to poles and conduits to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other cable operators in their service area. **********Telephone companies could also cross-subsidize their affiliated cable service to the detriment of independent cable systems operating in their regions. Expressing similar concern, the F.C.C. said that any proposal to allow telephone companies to own cable companies should have regulatory safeguards. More Investment Encouraged **********In an additional effort to allow telephone companies further entry into the cable market, the F.C.C. today also adopted a proposed rule that would expand the amount that telephone companies could invest in cable systems. **********Local telephone companies praised the F.C.C.'s actions. **********But the National Cable Association, a Washington-based industry group, assailed the moves, saying that consumers would be forced to subsidize the telephone companies' high-risk investment in cable television. **********A spokeswoman for the Nynex Corporation, which provides local phone service in New York State and New England, said: ''We applaud the F.C.C. move to explore the benefits of telephone company cable cross-ownership. Greater competition in this arena holds the promise of increased service options.'' **********Jana Weatherbe, a spokeswoman for the GTE Corporation, said, ''This is good news for consumers because we can be a cost-effective provider of cable entertainment in our franchise.'' A Wider Range of Services **********Local telephone companies, which have been seeking to widen their range of communications services, have long viewed cable television as a natural field for expansion. **********In making their case for providing cable TV, phone companies have implied that they would install fiber optic cable in homes to provide more efficient video transmission than conventional coaxial cable does. **********GTE, which operates local telephone companies throughout the United States, has already started testing a prototype of a telephone-cable system in Cerritos, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb. **********Tom Gillett, GTE's director of advanced operations testing, said one service the company hopes to test is a video telephone that customers can create by plugging a video camera into a communications outlet that would transmit images and voice over telephone-cable lines to television sets within the service area. **********Mr. Gillett said that if telephone companies were allowed to own cable television concerns in their service areas, it would take several years for them to install the new systems. **********''Instead of having two artificially separate services - video coming in on the cable line and voice and data on the phone line - they would be combined,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/business/company-news-andersen-and-utility-in-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1988-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Andersen And Utility In Inquiry", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Andersen And Utility In Inquiry", "body_text": " **********The tax and accounting practices of the Oglethorpe Power Corporation, an Atlanta-based electric cooperative, are the focus of a long-running criminal investigation, the Government official leading the inquiry said yesterday. **********The official, Richard Allen, the Atlanta-based regional inspector general for the Department of Agriculture, also said that the role of Oglethorpe's tax adviser, Arthur Andersen & Company, was being examined as part of the inquiry. **********Mr. Allen said that documents had been subpoenaed from Oglethorpe and 10 other major electric cooperatives as part of the investigation. The issuing of the subpoenas had been reported in yesterday's editions of The Wall Street Journal.

Justice Department Inquiry **********In a telephone interview from his Atlanta office, Mr. Allen said the department began its investigation last February after the Justice Department said it was conducting an inquiry of Oglethorpe and Arthur Andersen. **********Mr. Allen said that the department's Rural Electrification Administration, which provides investment capital for electric and telephone service in rural agencies, had made substantial loans to Oglethorpe. Thus, any tax fraud or false financial reporting would give the agency cause to call in its loans. **********Mr. Allen declined to give further details of the investigation.

(8 A.M. in Moscow and midnight Eastern daylight time), the bare prairie horizon heaved toward the sky, a concussive thud shook the air, and a strong shock wave in the earth jolted American and Soviet officials waiting at a makeshift base less than three miles from ground zero. **********As the brown grass and earth settled, a thick cloud of dust billowed into the air, rising toward two helicopters that circled testing for possible radiation leakage at the Semipalatinsk Test Range, 80 miles from the city of Semipalatinsk. Soviet officials later reported there was no leak. **********Seemingly shaken by the blast, up to 10 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima 43 years ago, the American officials and their Soviet counterparts, including five Soviet generals, were momentarily silent and then broke into applause. U.S. Explosion in August **********The test in this remote, unpopulated corner of the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, not far from the Chinese border, followed by less than a month an American underground nuclear explosion in Nevada that was witnessed by Soviet officials and measured by Soviet equipment. **********Reassured by the two tests on the prospects of verifying Soviet compliance with underground testing limitations, American officials said the Administration would soon submit to the Senate for approval two treaties negotiated in the 1970's. These are the threshold test-ban treaty, which was concluded in 1974 and set a 150-kiloton limit on tests, and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty, signed in 1976. A kiloton is equal to the explosive force of 1,000 tons of dynamite. **********In conducting the explosions, each country curtailed much of the tight secrecy that has long surrounded its testing program, reflecting the improved relations between Washington and Moscow. **********The practice in these experiments is not to disclose the precise size of the blast, designed to be between 100 and 150 kilotons. The Soviet press agency Tass reported that range today, according to other wire reports. **********Today's explosion was also the first time that Western reporters, including three Americans, were invited to witness a Soviet nuclear test. **********''Who could have imagined a year ago that the Soviet and American experts would work together in Nevada and now here?'' said Igor M. Palenykh, Moscow's chief representative at nuclear test negotiations in Geneva, told Soviet and Western reporters at a news conference after the explosion. American Is Pleased **********C. Paul Robinson, the senior American representative at the Geneva talks, said: ''It indeed seems remarkable that less than a year ago our two nations agreed to open negotiations on testing. We are pleased with the results.'' **********More than 140 American technicians have lived and worked at the Soviet test range in recent months to help prepare for today's blast. **********The two tests, called for in an agreement signed during President Reagan's visit to Moscow in May, are expected to reduce, if not resolve, longstanding differences between the two nations on measuring the yield of underground nuclear explosions. **********One result, according to Soviet and American officials here, is likely to be further steps to limit the number and size of nuclear tests. The limits are expected to be worked out in Geneva. **********A comprehensive test ban, advocated by Moscow, is opposed by Washington, which contends that some testing is necessary for modernization. **********Atmospheric testing has been banned since 1963 under the limited nuclear test-ban treaty. Question of Seismic Testing **********Before the joint tests this summer, the Administration opposed approval of the threshold test-ban treaty and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty on the grounds that Soviet compliance could not be verified solely on the basis of seismic data collected at stations outside the Soviet Union. Seismic instruments measure tremors in the earth. **********Washington has insisted on the use of an on-site monitoring technique known as Corrtex, which involves placing a cable in a shaft parallel to the hole constaining the nuclear device. Explosive yield is determined by measuring the speed with which the cable is crushed. **********The Corrtex system was used to measure today's explosion. The system was installed here by American technicians who drilled a parallel hole, adjacent to the 642-meter shaft where the Soviet nuclear device was. **********Although Soviet officials today expressed continuing skepticism about the Corrtex system, primarily because it is more intrusive than seismic measuring, they seemed resigned to accepting a mixture of the two techniques. **********Questions about the accuracy of the Corrtex system were raised after the initial finding of the Nevada test last month suggested that the seismic approach would have performed as well or better than the Corrtex. **********One American Corrtex device installed at Nevada reportedly showed the explosive yield was more than 150 kilotons. A second showed more than 160 kilotons. **********American officials said before the tests that the nuclear explosion would have a yield in the 140-kiloton range. **********Seismic measurements showed the yield was closer to 140 kilotons. **********Exact data on today's test will not be available for 10 days. **********American officials, accustomed to monitoring tests in Nevada from a more distant point, usually about 30 miles from the blast site, seemed somewhat astonished by their nearness to the explosion. **********The American delegation, aside from Mr. Robinson, included Joseph F. Salgado, Deputy Energy Secretary; George F. Murphy, Deputy Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Troy E. Wade 2d, Acting Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs; Victor E. Alessi, Director of the Arms Control Office at the Energy Department, and Thomas E. Dowling of the State Department. **********Senior Soviet officials included Aleksandr N. Prodsenko, chairman of the State Committee on Atomic Energy; Gen. Vladimir I. Gerasimov and a senior Defense Ministry official; Gen. Arkady Iliyenko, director of the test range, and several top officials from the Ministry of Medium Machine Building, which is partly responsible for the development of Soviet nuclear weapons. **********Today's test was also monitored by a private American organization, the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was permitted by Moscow to install and operate eight seismic stations in the Soviet Union. The five distant stations will remain in operation to measure future Soviet tests, an official of the council said this week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/business/credit-markets-first-bond-rally-of-1988-fizzles.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 983, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First Bond Rally of 1988 Fizzles", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; First Bond Rally of 1988 Fizzles", "body_text": " **********The first bond market rally of 1988 fizzled yesterday as long-term Treasury issues fell as much as 1 1/2 points, completely erasing the gains of the previous two days. **********Securities dealers said hectic foreign exchange trading and wide fluctuations in the dollar discouraged potential buyers of notes and bonds, and led to weak demand at yesterday's auction of $6.5 billion of new seven-year Treasury notes. **********''There is a perception in the market that the dollar is being propped up by the buying of central banks, and that its recent strength cannot be sustained,'' said John R. Williams, vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. ''Under those conditions, foreigners do not want to get involved, and for that reason U.S. participants are not too excited either.'' **********When the dollar was rising earlier this week, securities dealers hoped it would help attract more demand from foreign buyers who have been absent in recent months. **********By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent bonds due in 2017 were offered at 98 3/4, down 1 1/2 points, to yield 8.99 percent. The benchmark Treasury issue, which is the favorite issue for bond market speculators around the world, traded as high as 100 18/32 in London, about the same time as the dollar reached to a peak of about 131.9 yen. Dollar Weakens **********But the strength of the dollar, which had helped lift Treasury bond prices the previous two days, was not sustained. By the time trading activity shifted to New York, the dollar was heading lower, and so were bond prices. **********In the note market, the Treasury's new 8 5/8 percent issue due Jan. 15, 1995, sold with an average yield of 8.67 percent at the 1 P.M. auction, well above the 8.52 percent low yield set earlier in the week when prices of Treasury issues were higher. But the increased yield did not attract many buyers, and by late in the day, Government securities dealers offered the notes at about 8.70 percent. The Treasury's 7 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered late in the day at 100 5/32, down 5/32, to yield about 7.79 percent. **********Some analysts said that developments in the foreign exchange market could not be blamed entirely for the drop in Treasury note and bond prices. **********'We did not see much retail participation earlier in the week when the market was going up,'' said one Treasury bond trader, who added that yesterday's declines did not seem to be the result of any heavy selling from investor portfolios. ''I think a lot of people are waiting for the the 15th, to see the trade number,'' he said, referring to the American trade data to be published later this month. **********Although there is widespread agreement that the deficit will decline from the record $17.6 billion reported for October, many economists doubt that the decline will be large enough to convince the foreign exchange markets that the dollar is not vulnerable to additonal declines. Mr. Williams of Bankers Trust, for example, estimated that several months of trade data showing deficits of $12 billion to $13 billion might be needed to reassure the foreign exchange markets. But like many other economists, he expects that the November deficit will be in the vicinity of $15 billion. **********Donald Sheahan, senior vice president at the Nikko Securities Company International in charge of fixed-income securities, noted that many American and foreign investors were not prepared to make sizable investments while they were still involved in early-year strategy meetings. **********In the corporate market, the decline in Treasury note prices did not prevent the offering of a handful of new issues totaling $650 million. Offerings included BP America's 10-year notes at 9.61 percent, ITT Financial's seven-year notes at 9.55 percent and a five-year issue by the Times Mirror Company at 8.98 percent. **********Late in the day, the Transamerica Corporation offered notes due in 1998 at 9.92 percent and a 1995 issue at 9.67 percent. Goldman, Sachs was the lead underwriter for all the new issues, except for the ITT offering, which was handled by Shearson Lehman Brothers. **********Tax-exempt bond prices declined slightly, raising yields of long- term issues measured by The Bond Buyer's Municipal Index to 8.31 percent, from 8.28 percent. The drop for tax-exempt issues was much less than the rise of more than a tenth of a percentage point in the Treasury market - a trend that analysts at Gabriel, Hueglin & Cashman said is quite common at this time of year. **********In a recent research report, Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at the municipal bond firm, noted that from Christmas to the end of December, tax-exempt bond prices have outperformed the Treasury market in eight of the last 10 years. **********Although there was no surge of new tax-exempt financings during December to depress prices late last year, Gabriel, Hueglin analysts noted that tax-exempt issues will still benefit from a Janauary calendar that is extremely light. **********In addition, they noted that tax-exempt bond prices fare well in January because a relatively large proportion of tax-exempt bonds pay interest on Jan. 1 and July 1, rather than being spread more evenly through the year as in the Treausry market. As the tax-exempt bond interest payments are reinvested, it helps lift prices of outstanding issues, they said. **********Following are the results of yester-day's auction of seven-year Treasury notes:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)           Average Price    99.768        Average Yield    8.67%        Low Price    99.716        High Yield    8.68%        High Price    99.871        Low Yield    8.65%        Accepted at low price    63%        Total applied for    $15,851,257        Accepted    $6,512,597        N.Y. applied for    $14,194,534        N.Y. accepted    $6,052,684        Noncompetitive    $283,000        Interest set at    8 5/8%       The seven-year notes mature Jan. 15, 1995."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/business/business-people-hard-rock-co-founder-has-expansion-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1988-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 458, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hard Rock Co-Founder Has Expansion Plans", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Hard Rock Co-Founder Has Expansion Plans", "body_text": " **********Peter A.

Mr. Aylwin is considered a leading contender. Military Urged to Begin Talks **********The announcement today also included a formal appeal to the armed forces to open negotiations on amendments to the Constitution that most of Chile's political parties, including some that supported General Pinochet, want before the elections. The most crucial, in the eyes of the parties, is to ease the rules for amendment of the Constitution in the future. **********General Pinochet's loss in the one-man plebiscite, in which he sought eight more years in power, means that he must call free elections by the end of next year, then hand over the presidency to his elected successor on March 11, 1990.

They smile at the women who will escort them to new homes half a world away. **********Six thousand Korean children a year - given up for adoption by unwed mothers or abandoned by their parents - are adopted by American families alone. Unlike other countries, where black markets for infants have sprung up, South Korea goes by the book. Indeed, the Government supports the idea of foreign adoptions and oversees each step of the adoption process, licensing adoption agencies and the unwed mothers' homes that supply them with babies. **********This flow of children overseas began when South Korea was a poor nation, its cities and families devastated by the Korean War. That it continues now, when South Korea boasts skyscrapers, giant factories and the 1988 Olympic Games, is prompting questions. **********Critics charge that it is time South Korea took care of its own, that sending Korean children abroad robs them of their culture and spares the Government the expense of caring for them. But those who support foreign adoptions say very few Korean families are willing to take in children who are not blood relations. In a country where most families proudly display thick volumes of genealogical charts, where the Confucian respect for ancestors remains very much alive, there is little place for children of a different bloodline. Sensitive Issues for Nation **********The debate touches on sensitive issues for this swiftly growing, swiftly changing nation. South Korea is no longer a third-world country, so poor that it cannot afford to feed and shelter its children. Yet this very industrial development has helped to swell the nation's pool of unwanted children, even as the number of war-displaced or orphaned children shrank. **********Most of the children adopted overseas are born to unwed mothers, usually teen-age women who left the countryside to work in factories in the city. Koreans are torn between the sense of national shame about sending children abroad and a reluctance to welcome them at home. **********''In the beginning, the only reason foreign adoptions were allowed was that it was so difficult to raise children after the Korean War,'' said a Government social work official who asked to remain anonymous. The topic of foreign adoptions arouses so much controversy here that the Government ministries that oversee foreign adoptions refuse to grant interviews or provide statistics. **********''If we had abided by our cultural traditions, it would never have happened,'' the official said. ''There is a growing voice that we should take care of our own orphans. We don't feel very good about sending these children abroad - we're not poor anymore. But I see photos of Korean children adopted by American families, and I can see how much the children are loved and cared for. It is harder for Koreans to accept these children.'' Overseeing the Process **********With this rationale, the South Korean Government has allowed and tacitly encouraged foreign adoptions - although they require agencies to try to place babies first with a Korean family. Last year, according to State Department immigration figures, 5,742 Korean children were adopted by American families; in 1986, 6,150 Korean children were adopted. That represents 59 percent of all foreign children adopted in the United States. Korean adoption agencies dispute these statistics, saying that more babies enter the United States illegally from countries like Mexico. **********To insure that foreign adoptions remain aboveboard, the South Korean Government licenses four adoption agencies to handle all foreign adoptions. The agencies draw children from hospitals where unwanted babies are delivered, police stations that pick up abandoned children, and a network of unwed mothers' homes that they help support financially. **********Pregnant factory workers are tormented by shame, and most want to give up their babies to start a new life, said Kim Yong Sook, who runs a Salvation Army shelter for unwed mothers. Freed from the close supervision of their families, naive about sex and birth control, most become pregnant accidentally, she said. Some are raped, but in either case, most families refuse to support either the mother or the child; an out-of-wedlock pregnancy embarrasses the entire family. **********''What matters most is to give another chance to a girl in distress and despair,'' Miss Kim said. New Parents Pay $4,000 **********Once the baby is born, the adoption agencies take it and place it with a Korean foster parent until adoption papers come through, said the director of one of the country's largest adoption agencies, who agreed to be interviewed only if his name and that of his agency did not appear. Then the babies are sent to the United States or other foreign countries, in the care of escorts who give the agency a small donation and receive a free ticket. The agency pays the mother's medical expenses and delivery fees. **********The adoptive parents pay around $4,000, a fee that includes transportation costs, medical expenses, payments to Korean foster parents and adoption agency processing costs. **********The scale and the efficiency of the adoption process in South Korea troubles those who believe that the nation should make more effort to keep its children at home. ''I think the women are pushed to give up their babies, and that the agencies do get profits from the adoptions,'' said a social worker who has dealt with adoption agencies for years. **********It is clear that foreign adoptions bring in more money to the agencies - the agency director interviewed said there is virtually no charge when Korean families adopt children. But for the most part, the fees charged for foreign adoptions do not seem inflated. Robert L. Ackerman, immigration attache at the American Embassy in Seoul, who oversees foreign adoptions, said that although he had reservations about the numbers of children going overseas, he had seen no evidence of fraud or profiteering. **********The social worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said she disapproved of foreign adoptions because Korean children then grow up ignorant of their culture and the Government is spared addressing a real social problem: the increasing numbers of illegitimate children and the need to support the mothers. **********''It is true that even if they want to raise children, how could they?'' she said. ''So it's not only pressure but the situation that makes them give up the baby. At least the Government should start trying to decrease the number of foreign adoptions, but they are not even trying.'' **********While the debate continues, the babies keep leaving, on their way from one home to the next."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/19/business/what-s-new-in-contact-lenses-the-bitter-battle-between-doctors-and-chain-stores.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Gill", "pub_date": "1988-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Bitter Battle Between Doctors and Chain Stores", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN CONTACT LENSES; The Bitter Battle Between Doctors and Chain Stores", "body_text": " **********TEN years ago, private optometrists and ophthalmologists prescribed and fit 80 percent of all lenses.

Unita did not take part in the negotiations that produced the agreement.

''Some are in construction, paramilitary or civilian jobs,'' he said. ''Some are doctors or teachers, but have military preparation and could be used as fighters. They provide a backup infrastructure for the Cuban military presence in our country. They are camouflaged Cubans.'' A Letter to Reagan **********Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, and 49 other senators recently sent a letter to President Reagan warning that the Angolan Government apparently wanted the ''military destruction of Unita'' while negotiating peace with South Africa. **********In his reply, Mr. Reagan said there were signs that Angola would enter negotiations with the rebels. He said President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola asked ''a number of neighboring states'' to help arrange talks between Angola and the guerrillas as a way to promote national reconciliation. **********But Mr. Chitunda said the Angolan Government ''remains intransigent, is making no moves toward national reconciliation'' and is unwilling to negotiate with the guerrillas. ''Why is that?'' he asked. ''Is it because the Government can still count on the presence of a residual force of Cubans?'' **********Angolan officials have offered clemency to individual members of Unita. The only guerrilla leader not eligible for clemency is Mr. Savimbi, who is described as a special case. **********Mr. Chitunda said: ''There is no Unita without Savimbi.

A half-century later, both materials are still widely used staples in the industrial world and continue to generate innovative new uses. They have earned their inventor, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, untold millions of dollars. **********Nylon was the first man-made fiber to achieve widespread popular use, appearing in everything from toothbrush bristles to fishing line. It first captured the public's fancy before World War II as the ''artificial silk'' in affordable sheer women's hosiery. **********Teflon, a residue of refrigeration gases that accidentally was discovered to be very slippery, became best known as a non-stick cookware coating, but also found uses as a wiring insulator, lubricant and material in artificial organs. **********An example of nylon and Teflon's technological staying power is Du Pont's recent marriage of the two to form a new anti-stain carpet fiber. Carpet mills take raw nylon, dye it and treat it with a fluorochemical compound similar to Teflon to prevent soiling, and then add an anti-staining compound.

''But people should not be discouraged by these low sales because there are going to be some pretty good product introductions later in the model year.'' **********Detroit sold an average of 37,138 light vehicles a day in the Oct. 21-31 period, bringing its results for the whole month to 35,840 units a day, up 16.6 percent from October 1987.

This compares with the very strong 7.6 million rate for domestic cars during the first nine months of the year. Annualized rates were calculated from a formula devised by the Department of Commerce. Total Industry Outlook **********L. Ray Windecker, a sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company, said 1989 had a ''strong shot'' at becoming the second-best sales year ever. ''The total industry, cars and trucks, domestic and imported, will exceed 15.7 million unit sales this year, compared to the record of 16.33 million in 1986 and the 15.72 million of 1985,'' he said. **********Mr. Kleinaitis forecast 15.8 million for this year and 15.5 million for 1989, adding that domestic manufacturers would do even better than these numbers alone suggested. ''Domestic share is up again this month, and that's good news: people are buying domestic cars because their quality is improved,'' he said. **********Imported cars and trucks took 24.6 percent of the total market in October, down 4.3 percentage points from a year ago. Imported cars were down 2.9 percent, to a daily selling rate of 9,842, and imported trucks were down 24.2 percent, to a daily rate of 1,825. **********Suzuki of America sold 1,509 vehicles under its own brand name in the month, 73.5 percent fewer than in October 1987. The company attributed this to the lack of availability of its Samurai sports-utility vehicle and of its upscale replacement, the Sidekick; this month it also added the Swift GTi subcompact car, though so far it has sold only 16. **********''Suzuki anticipates that November sales will begin to rebound,'' the company said in a statement, adding that total sales should match last year's level by early 1989. **********But Mr. Kleinaitis said this was unlikely, arguing that Suzuki's image continues to suffer from allegations that the Samurai is unstable in emergency maneuvers.

Ford's share in October came to 24.6 percent of the total market, up 2.1 percentage points. **********The Chrysler Corporation sold 3,393 domestic cars a day, up 3.7 percent, and 3,116 light trucks a day, up 9.9 percent. It took 14.1 percent of the market during the whole month, up four-tenths of a percentage point. **********Among the foreign-owned domestic manufactures, Honda of America sold 1,595 cars a day in late October, up 8.8 percent.

From about 200 responses Ms. Paetro and Ms. Arteca winnow out 30 to 40, from which the executive creative directors make the final selections. **********''We hire as many as we think can make it in the business,'' Ms. Paetro said. **********And, although nobody who has worked in an agency creative department is eligible for the training program, most have had advertising courses and there is no need to cover the basics. After a two-week indoctrination, they begin doing actual work and will go in turn to each of the three creative groups. **********''Every four months we switch and the kids get to work on all kinds of accounts,'' Ms. Paetro said. ''So the wanderlust is satisfied.'' **********On his third day on the job, Steve Herman, an art director, came up with an idea for a Royal Crown Cola campaign that ran nationally. Jane King and Steve Miller, a writer-art director team, won a gold medal at the international commercials competition in Cannes for a TV spot they did for Philips light bulbs.

The city is in the Azerbaijan Republic, which along with the neighboring Armenian Republic has been shaken by nationalist protests and clashes in the last two weeks. **********The eruption of violence in Sumgait, about 20 miles from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, suggested that the temporary suspension of massive protests in the Armenian capital of Yerevan over the weekend did not mean a quick end to one of the most serious cases of nationalist unrest in the Soviet Union since the 1920's. Christians and Moslems **********Unofficial information reaching Moscow indicated that the rioting in Sumgait, a city of 220,000, involved fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. **********Clashes between the two groups in recent weeks in other parts of Azerbaijan left two Azerbaijanis dead and several dozen Armenians and Azerbaijanis injured, according to Government reports. **********The two groups are divided by religion - the Armenians primarily Christian, the Azerbaijanis primarily Shiite Moslem - and by a history of conflict predating the formation of the Soviet Union. **********The report about Sumgait came as protests reportedly continued in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, a largely Armenian area within Azerbaijan. Longstanding Demands **********The recent nationalist unrest began with, and has centered on, the revival of longstanding demands that the region be unified with Armenia. Sumgait is about 150 miles northeast of Nagorno-Karabakh. **********Residents and government officials in Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, said in telephone interviews today that Armenian demonstrators were again marching through the city. Foreign diplomats and reporters have not been allowed to visit the area. **********Demonstrations began in Nagorno-Karabakh on Feb. 13, then spread to Yerevan a week later. hundreds of thousands of Armenians boycotted schools and jobs there, pouring into the center of the capital for the largest nationalist demonstrations witnessed in the Soviet Union in decades. **********Yerevan was quiet again today, as life and work returned to normal after Mikhail S. Gorbachev's personal intervention on Friday. After Mr. Gorbachev called for a restoration of order and told two leading Armenian writers that he would review the grievances that touched off the protests, Armenian nationalist leaders appealed Saturday for a one-month suspension of the demonstrations in Yerevan. **********Following the Government's policy of disclosing only the sketchiest reports about the unrest, Tass said the disturbances in Sumgait were provoked by ''a group of hooligans.'' **********''Rampage and violence followed,'' Tass reported. The press agency added: ''Measures have been adopted to normalize the situation in the city and safeguard discipline and public order. An investigation has been launched.'' Background to the Conflict **********The Azerbaijani Republic, like Armenia, lies in a border area between the Christian world of European Russia to the northwest and the Moslem world of Turkey and Iran to the southwest and southeast. **********Within the Moslem world, the Azerbaijanis are part of the Shiite Moslem sect that holds sway in Iran. Soviet officials have long been concerned about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism to the religious and ethnic cousins of the Iranian Azerbaijanis. **********Among other things, the five million or more Soviet Azerbaijanis - the figure is from the 1979 Soviet census - share a common history and language with their five million ethnic cousins in Iran. **********But Moscow's worries now focus on the Christian-Islamic disputes that have rent the southern Caucasus for more than 150 years. **********Not only is the predominantly Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh wholly separated from Armenia by the boundaries drawn in the 1920's, but the largely Azerbaijani Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic is separated by Armenia from the rest of Azerbaijan, though it is governed from Baku. Accommodating Turkey **********These two territories reverted to Azerbaijani control in 1923 as part of a Soviet effort to accommodate the wishes of Moslem Turkey, whose help it sought in subduing the ethnically Moslem areas of Central Asia. **********Few issues raise greater concern in Moscow than nationalist agitation because it cuts to the stability of the state. The Soviet Union is a nation of more than 100 ethnic groups uneasily united under the Communist banner and governed by members of a Russian majority that is likely to become a minority by the turn of the century if current demographic trends continue. **********Soviet officials like to talk about their society as one of multinational harmony, where Soviet patriotism and allegiance to Communism override regional and cultural interests. **********But in reality many ethnic groups -including Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians, as well as nationalists in the Kazakh city of Alma-Ata who rioted in December 1986 - have maintained a distinct national character and pride, and chafe at Soviet rule, which in many cases was imposed by force as first Russia, and later the Soviet Union, extended its boundaries. Criticism of Gorbachev **********The suspension of the latest round of demonstrations did not end the problem for Mr. Gorbachev. **********For one thing, he may be held accountable by other party leaders for creating a permissive climate that helped produce the Armenian and other nationalist protests. Mr. Gorbachev has said repeatedly in recent months that his policies were meeting criticism for eroding discipline and increasing the chances of disorder. He strenuously rejected these assertions. **********A number of banners carried by protesters in Yerevan underlined the possible link between nationalist unrest and Mr. Gorbachev's policies. **********''Karabakh is a test of perestroika,'' one banner said, referring to Mr. Gorbachev's policy of restructuring the economy and liberalizing the Soviet system. Another said, ''Self-determination is not extremism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/business/housing-starts-and-permits-are-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Housing Starts and Permits Are Up", "print_headline": "Housing Starts and Permits Are Up", "body_text": " **********Builders broke ground for new homes at an annual rate of 1,494,000 in February, an 8.9 percent increase that followed two straight declines, the Commerce Department reported today. **********The rebound, which was somewhat stronger than many analysts had expected, prompted industry officials to predict a solid spring building season that would help extend the business expansion, now in its sixth year. **********''It's beginning to be a safer bet that the aftershocks of the stock market decline and the inventory buildup are really dissipating,'' said James W. Christian, chief economist for the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********Today's figures also showed that permits for future housing starts climbed 11.5 percent last month and that the strength in both starts and permits was geographically broad. Report on Industrial Output **********Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said industrial production (the output of the nation's factories, utilities and mines) climbed two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the fifth advance in a row. This was in line with predictions based on February labor-market data, the number of workers in such jobs and the average workweek, all reported 12 days ago. **********Industrial production, as a ''coincident'' indicator of business activity, tends to rise and fall at the same time as the economy as a whole.

Gramley, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board and now chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said today's housing and output data were further reasons for pessimists to ''rethink the hypothesis'' of impending recession. **********He said housing was helped by the fall in interest rates to about 10 percent, from nearly 12 percent in mid-October, by strong job growth and by rebounding confidence. **********''The longer you go after a crash without a downturn,'' commented Martin A. Regalia of the National Council of Savings Institutions, ''the less it weighs on people's minds.'' **********Although apartment and condominium construction also rebounded in February, however, analysts said this sector would remain sluggish or worse for various reasons, including high vacancy rates in the South. Mr. Stuard of the home builders' group called the outlook ''bleak,'' mentioning a continued negative effect of the 1986 tax legislation, cutbacks in Federal housing assistance and the lagging incomes of renters. **********''The demand for low-cost rental housing is still rising in many markets, but builders can't get units in the ground at rents people can afford,'' Mr. Stuard said. Severe Weather in January **********February's 8.9 percent rise in total starts, the most in more than a year, followed a 15.8 percent plunge in December and a 1.9 percent drop in January. Although the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations, economists said unusually harsh January weather depressed the result. **********The Commerce Department today revised the January starts rate to 1,372,000, down slightly from the 1,377,000 it had initially estimated. Single-family homes climbed to a rate of 1,095,000 from 1,002,000, while two-to-four-unit dwellings rose to 55,000, from 51,000, and dwellings of five or more units rose to 344,000, from 319,000. **********Starts rose 2.7 percent in the Northeast, 13.8 percent in the Midwest and 25.6 percent in the South but declined 8.9 percent in the West. **********Permits ran at a rate of 1,402,000 -998,000 for single-family houses, 75,000 in two-to-four-unit dwellings and 329,000 in larger buildings. The South also did best in permits, with a 30.4 percent jump. The Midwest and West had modest increases, and the Northeast had a 4.1 percent decline. **********Despite the rebound, the pace of starts last month was 17.4 percent below that of February 1987. **********''The numbers still aren't good,'' Mr. Regalia said.

Still, Mr. Walker, a possible successor to Robin Leigh-Pemberton as the central bank's governor, is not seen as a man who will do the securities industry's bidding. **********The new law is the regulatory response to London's ''Big Bang'' in October 1986, when the British securities business was opened to outsiders and restrictive practices were abolished. Before the Big Bang, the business was a small, clubby world, shielded from competition. It essentially regulated itself, with the Bank of England as referee, exercising its authority informally but absolutely. Small Investors Vulnerable **********Even before the Big Bang, the drawbacks of self-regulation were becoming obvious. With the selloff of state enterprises to private investors, more small investors began owning shares and were vulnerable to fraud. Since 1979, the number of shareholders in Britain has tripled to nine million, or about 20 percent of the adult population. **********After the Big Bang, the Guinness P.L.C. share-price-manipulation scandal arose, along with several insider-trading cases, prompting a call for tighter regulation. The Financial Services Act was the response. **********After lengthy debate, the Government decided against adopting an entirely statutory system of regulation with a large, independent force of overseers and investigators, along the lines of America's Securities and Exchange Commission. Tougher Than the U.S. Britain, instead, chose a two-tier approach that combines self-regulation with tougher laws. The result was the creation of a Government agency, the Securities and Investment Board, overseeing five self-regulating organizations, which in turn monitor 40,000 firms, ranging from small investment advisers to international investment banks. **********In some respects, the new British system is even tougher than that of the United States. For example, London brokers and fund managers must now get clients to sign 16-page documents detailing charges, commissions and countless other matters before they can do business. In the United States, these agreements are not required on most cash accounts, and even brokers' margin accounts require less documentation. In addition, unsolicited sales calls, known in America as ''cold calls,'' are barred. 'Tip of the Iceberg' **********Most securities houses here have added to their staffs to meet the disclosure and reporting requirements. Phillips & Drew, a major London broker, has added four people to its compliance department. ''But that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of costs,'' noted Geoffrey Redman-Brown, a Phillips director. More important, he says, is the management time required to make sure the rules are followed. **********Estimates by firms of additional costs range from several thousand dollars to a few million dollars a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/world/salvador-guerrillas-kill-6-more.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvador Guerrillas Kill 6 More", "print_headline": "Salvador Guerrillas Kill 6 More", "body_text": " **********Guerrillas killed six soldiers today in attacks on an army post and a bridge, the authorities said. **********The assaults were carried out a day after rebels attacked the National Guard headquarters here, killing at least 4 soldiers and wounding 38.

'A Grave Disaster' **********''It is a grave disaster, simply a tragedy,'' Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, said of the earthquake in a television interview. **********''I have seen so many people in trouble, who have lost near and dear ones - whole families,'' he said as he left the Armenian capital of Yerevan after a daylong visit to the stricken area to the north. ''I have simply been shaken by everything that I have seen in these two days.'' **********A steady procession of foreign aircraft has been arriving in Armenia since the quake struck, including a highly unusual mercy mission today from Israel, which does not have formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. **********These flights have carried food, clothing, medical supplies and experts to help in salvage efforts. More than 300 cargo planes have landed in the region in the last few days, Moscow radio reported, creating what it described as a ''permanent air bridge'' there. Airfield Quickly Improved **********The Leninakan airport has increased its traffic from four or five daily flights to as many as 180 in a single day, Tass reported, and soldiers lengthened the airport landing strip to accommodate the load. **********Yevgeny P. Chazov, the Soviet Health Minister, said in an interview at a makeshift command post in Yerevan, that 50,000 to 70,000 people had died in the earthquake. The Government said Saturday that the quake left about 45,000 dead, 12,000 injured and 500,000 homeless. **********Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet Government had set aside five billion rubles - about $8 billion at the official rate of exchange - to help with rescue and recovery. However vast, it is an outlay that promises to be just a first installment in a total that will probably exceed the eight-billion-ruble cost of the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. **********The people who died in the plane crash were planning to join an estimated 20,000 soldiers and 85,000 civil defense workers who have been burying the dead, searching through mounds of rubble for possible survivors, supplying food and water, and trying to put up sanitary facilities to minimize outbreaks of disease. **********Ever since relief efforts began, Tass has issued one report after another of planes destined for, or landing in the region, creating congestion amid all the good will that might have contributed to the crash. Huge Foreign Airlift **********The vast Soviet relief effort is being supplemented by the biggest influx of foreign assistance since World War II. Foreign doctors helped in treating the victims of Chernobyl, but the willingness to accept such extensive help from abroad is unusual for a country reluctant to admit that it cannot handle emergencies on its own, and it emphasizes the enormity of the disaster. **********The relief effort has been a grim experience for rescue workers, who hour after hour come upon agonizing discoveries in the wreckage of apartments, factories and schools. One group of workers found a group of schoolchildren and their teacher, crushed together in what had been a classroom. **********''It is simply difficult to bear this in human terms,'' Mr. Gorabchev said in an interview broadcast on Moscow radio. ''It is unbearable.'' **********The newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya said that rescue efforts would continue for about a week, before workers turn their attention toward reconstructing devastated cities, a process that officials say will take two years and will probably take longer. Spitak, a town of 30,000 people that was virtually wiped out in the quake, will be entirely rebuilt. A Nervous City **********The combination of the earthquake and renewed ethnic unrest among Armenians who mistrust Moscow's handling of the situation, seemed to bring Yerevan close to the breaking point as a cold rain pelted the hilly city today. **********Armenian nationalist protesters clashed with soldiers even as planeloads of aid were arriving from the United States, Britain, France, Israel, Sweden, Poland, Switzerland, Austria and other countries, producing near chaos at Yerevan airport. **********A Soviet airliner arriving from Leninakan, a city severely damaged by the earthquake, brought people freed from the debris hours earlier. They had not yet heard of the plane crash at the Leninakan airport.  As ambulances swarmed around the plane at Yerevan airport, the injured were carried down steep steps on military stretchers, nearly tumbling out as workers strained in the darkness and rain to keep them level. **********The deafening whine of passing jets drowned out the hoarse shouts of the rescue workers as they tried to coordinate their steps. Tales of Grief **********Inside the terminal, stunned quake surivivors like Samuel Sarkisian frantically tried to buy tickets on flights to Moscow, Leningrad and other cities where injured relatives were evacuated for treatment. **********''My father and brother were killed in Leninakan when our apartment building collapsed,'' he said. ''I didn't have time to bury them. I just left them in coffins and came here so I could try to visit my brother, who was taken to Moscow.'' **********He said the brother's legs had been crushed when the apartment building crumbled. **********Western pilots reported a breakdown in air-traffic communications, with flight controllers at the Yerevan tower failing to provide critical navigation instructions as planes descended, often precariously close to one another. **********With taxiways jammed with aircraft, helicopters, trucks, ambulances and hundreds of volunteer workers, an oversized Soviet cargo plane smacked the tail of an Air Europe Boeing 757 jet, bringing part of the airport to a standstill for hours. **********Little of the arriving aid - the flights started soon after the extent of quake devastation became apparent late last week - seemed to be reaching Leninakan, Kirovakan and the other cities most badly damaged. Survivors Seem Disconsolate **********Video footage shot before the plane crash by an American television crew that visited Leninakan today showed hundreds of survivors wandering aimlessly about the ruined city while others dug furiously through the rubble searching for buried relatives. **********There was little sign of the food, tents, cranes and other aid sent to Armenia from regions throughout the Soviet Union and from abroad. **********Dr. Chazov, who is supervising the treatment of survivors, said more than 2,000 major surgical operations had been performed in recent days in Yerevan hospitals. **********''It has been like treating wartime casualties,'' he said, adding that all hospitals and clinics in the quake area had been destroyed or seriously damaged and many of the doctors and nurses killed. **********He said that some medical supplies and equipment were still urgently needed, including kidney-dialysis machines. **********Doctors here told reporters that kidney-dialysis machines were one of the most urgent needs because when human bodies are crushed under falling rubble, toxins flow to the kidneys, and death can result if the kidneys are not flushed. British and American Help **********A number of planes arriving today carried medical supplies from the West, including a shipment of drugs, plasma and disposable syringes brought aboard a corporate jet owned by Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. The cabin of the Gulfstream 3 was packed with the supplies donated by British pharmaceutical companies. **********A United States Air Force C-141 transport arrived, ferrying 18 rescue specialists and paramedics from the Miami area and from northern Virginia. **********''Some of the men helped in the rescue after the Mexico City earthquake,'' said Bill McIntyre, one of the Americans. **********An Israeli military plane, unmarked except for a small blue Star of David below the tail section, carried army specialists equipped with infrared sensors to help locate people still buried under the rubble. **********The presence of the plane and specialists was the latest sign of improving relations between Israel and the Soviet Union. **********While hundreds of soldiers were stationed in Yerevan, which was unharmed by the earthquake, government authority appeared nonexistent in Leninakan, where 130,000 people were left homeless. **********''There is no government there,'' a Soviet official said after visiting the city."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/19/world/soviet-ousts-yeltsin-from-ruling-body.html": {"writer_name": "Felicity Barringer", "pub_date": "1988-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Ousts Yeltsin From Ruling Body", "print_headline": "Soviet Ousts Yeltsin From Ruling Body", "body_text": " **********Boris N.

The ensuing political drama of defiance and public humiliation, including spontaneous pro-Yeltsin demonstrations here, had much of the country transfixed late last year. Retains Central Committee Post **********Mr. Yeltsin retained his position on the Central Committee, the party's governing group, which is made up of about 300 senior party, government, industrial and academic leaders from around the country. After losing the Moscow party job last November, he was named deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee. **********With the outspoken Mr. Yeltsin gone, two politicians with much lower public profiles came to the fore. Yuri D. Maslyukov, a defense expert with an engineering background, and Georgi P. Razumovsky, an agricultural expert whose ties with Mr. Gorbachev go back to the days when they worked in neighboring regions in southern Russia's Kuban River valley, were elected non-voting members of the Politburo. Newest, and Youngest, Members **********Mr. Maslyukov, 50, and Mr. Razumovsky, 52, become the youngest of the 13 voting and seven non-voting members of the Politburo, and the only two members younger than the 56-year-old Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Yeltsin, 57 years old, had been a non-voting member of the Politburo. **********In the nearly three years since Mr. Gorbachev has been in office, 12 men, slightly more than half the membership, have been elected to the Politburo. **********But the first of his appointees, Yegor K. Ligachev, is now widely viewed by Western analysts as a counterforce to Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Ligachev, 67, has injected notes of caution that sometimes border on reproach into the push to implement Mr. Gorbachev's economic, social and political changes. **********The longest-serving member of the Politburo remains Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, 70, the Ukrainian party chief who was appointed by Nikita S. Khrushchev, ousted briefly and reappointed by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1964. He successfully weathered a political challenge recently, observers believe, and remains a force in the conservative wing of the party. Born in Moslem Republic **********Mr. Maslyukov, who has been a member of the Central Committee since 1986, is of Russian descent but was born in the city of Leninabad in predominantly Moslem Central Asia. He has worked since 1974 in leading managerial posts in the defense industry, the industrial sector with the highest priority in the Soviet economy. **********Mr. Razumovsky in the 1970's was a rising star in the government of Krasnodar territory, a rich agricultural region that encompasses the northern edge of the Caucasus, at the same time Mr. Gorbachev was rising through the party ranks in neighboring Stavropol. For the past two years, Mr. Razumovsky has handled Communist Party personnel matters, a powerful patronage job. Two Major Portfolios **********In a development that was deemed unusual, Lev N. Zaikov, who replaced Mr. Yeltsin as Moscow party boss in November, kept his control over party supervision of the defense industry. It is unusual for Politburo members to have two major portfolios. **********Nikolai V. Talyzin, who earlier this month was relieved of his management of Gosplan, the state planning agency, remained a non-voting member of the Politburo. **********While the issue of nationalism is of increasing concern to party leaders, the membership of the Politburo is as ethnically homogenous as it has been in years.

The company said it would use the proceeds to help trim its $1.7 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. **********The company is in arrears for four quarterly dividend payments on two separate series of preferred stock totaling about $22.5 million. It has not paid a dividend on common stock since the third quarter of 1985, and Henry Von Spreckelson, a spokesman, would not speculate on whether the company would resume making dividend payments on common stock, which has been suspended since the third quarter of 1985. $1.25 a Share Payment Bethlehem said it would pay $1.25 a share for each of the quarterly dividends it suspended, as well as the $1.25 dividend for the current quarter. The company said it would pay $1.7 million on the omitted dividend on its outstanding employee stock ownership plan by making payments in additional shares of preferred stock. **********In a statement, the company said that the dividend payments were possible because of Bethlehem's ''improved financial condition and the continuing improvement in business conditions affecting the company.'' **********Indeed, Bethlehem, which had a $1.4 billion loss in 1982 and a $152.7 million loss in 1986, was widely considered to be near bankruptcy just two years ago. But the steelmaker reported net income of $174.3 million, or $2.77 a share, for 1987. And the company spent more than $1 billion over the last three years to modernize its plants. **********Also, the Standard & Poor's Corporation earlier this year raised the company's senior-debt rating to B, from CCC+, and its subordinated debt rating to CCC+, from CCC-. Those ratings are still speculative grades, but they underline the improvement in the company's financial condition, analysts said. **********''They have surprised a lot of people on how they have turned themselves around as quickly as they have,'' said Jeffrey F.

Administration officials have said it would deter foreign investment and would lead to retaliatory measures by other nations. Acceptable to White House **********The sanctions against Toshiba were a compromise, reached after the Administration said Wednesday that it would veto the bill if it contained the stiffer sanctions recommended by the Senate. **********After today's vote, the Administration said the Toshiba provision was acceptable. The compromise would ban all sales in the United States for three years by the Toshiba Machine Company, the subsidiary that sold equipment to the Russians that let them build quieter submarines. The measure would also bar the Federal Government from buying any products of the parent Toshiba Corporation for a year. **********The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that ''I think we're hopeful'' the bill would be one the President could sign. **********But he pointed out the Administration's ''major problems'' with a plant-closing provision accepted by the conferees on Tuesday. The business community strongly opposes the measure, and Mr. Fitzwater said, ''We have a veto signal on from back in March.'' **********Businesses with more than 100 employees would be required to tell workers 60 days in advance if they planned to close a plant. The Administration and business groups regard the proposal as unwarranted interference in the private sector and will press for it to be eliminated when Senate conferees meet to review the entire bill. **********Under rules adopted by the legislators, all the Senate conferees will meet to review the decisions reached by the 17 subconferences, providing a final opportunity for modification. The House conferees will not review the subconferences' decisions unless their Senate counterparts raise an objection. **********The omnibus trade bill would increase the Administration's powers to strike at unfair trade practices by foreign countries, and it would authorize the President to conclude negotiations to further liberalize world trade and investment rules. **********On one issue that has provoked a veto threat - mandating Presidential retaliation against such countries - the conferees adopted a version close to what the Senate proposed, rather than the House version sponsored by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. **********Mr. Gephardt's plan, a foundation of his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, would have required the President to retaliate against countries that did not reduce by 10 percent annually their trade surpluses with the United States. **********The version approved today requires the Government to investigate countries that have a ''consistent pattern of import barriers and market-distorting practices.'' After no more than 12 months, the Government must retaliate if it finds the practices have not been ended and are hurting American industry. **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had supported the Gephardt plan, but he and Senator Lloyd Bentsen agreed on the milder proposal. **********''We're going to need a trade policy in the next couple of years,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said, ''and I think this is as good as anything that's going to come across the President's desk, Similarly, Mr. Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said: ''This is a good bill.'' **********The conferees also agreed to repeal the ''windfall profits'' tax on oil, something the Administration had favored. **********The Toshiba compromise took the form of concentrating on Toshiba Machine, which is 51 percent owned by Toshiba. From 1982 to 1984, Toshiba Machine and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway sold equipment to Moscow to help make quieter submarine propellers. **********Toshiba, the corporate parent, is one of Japan's leading electronics companies. It sold $2.5 billion worth of computers, copiers, telephones and other products in the United States last year. Toshiba Machine's sales in the United States were $105 million. **********The bans against Toshiba include exemptions for purchases determined to be essential to national security. **********Toshiba reacted strongly to the conferees' vote today. **********''Emotions got the better of the Congress in lashing out at an innocent parent,'' said David P. Houlihan, Toshiba's chief lawyer in the United States. ''That's something that would have never been done under U.S. law to a U.S. company.'' **********It could not be immediately determined exactly how much business the parent company does with the Federal Government, but the figure was estimated at more than $100 million a year. **********Pentagon purchases from the parent company are already banned under Congressional legislation enacted late last year. After the law was passed, the Defense Department told Toshiba it could not buy $100 million of laptop computers it had ordered. **********While applying sanctions to Toshiba, the conferees took a major step toward liberalizing American export controls. **********American businesses have long complained that too many goods require export licenses and that the licensing procedure hurts exporting. Although the restrictions are intended to keep sensitive technology like computers and sophisticated telecommunications out of Soviet hands, about 40 percent of all American manufactured exports to non- Communist countries are also subject to these controls. **********The provision adopted today sharply reduces the number of goods that must be licensed for export and sets up a two-tier system under which products shipped to countries deemed to have strong enforcement procedures would have fewer restrictions than those to countries found to be more lax. **********The conferees also agreed today to bar foreign companies from serving as primary dealers in the market for United States Government securities unless their governments end discrimination against American financial houses. **********The measure could lead to the exclusion of three large Japanese financial firms that are involved in such activity, should the Federal Reserve determine within one year that Japan does not offer American financial companies the same opportunities as Japanese firms. **********The three Japanese companies are Nomura Securities International, the Nikko Securities Company International and Daiwa Securities America. **********The measure's chief sponsor, Representative Charles E.

''It was beyond us to realize that they would sell out and not keep all of the money for themselves. Ten months ago, people working in our unit were worried about whether they would still have jobs by now. It's unbelievable.'' She referred to a recent downturn in employment in the otherwise healthy chemical industry on the Gulf coast in Texas. **********The profits from Cain's sale aside, the year-old chemical company is a striking example of how continued profit sharing can motivate workers and raise productivity. Steady Increase in Morale **********Cain executives attribute what they described as a steady increase in morale, productivity and teamwork to the profit-sharing plan that went into effect immediately after Cain was established. After debt service is subtracted from operating profit, 10 percent of the remainder is paid into a profit-sharing pool each quarter. **********The bonus checks are handed out each quarter by the company's president, William A. McMinn, personally. ''When people have a sense they are valuable to the company, they work awfully hard,'' he said. ''Our philsophy was, 'If we do well, guys, you get a part of it.' So often, as you know, that's not the way it works.'' **********The payouts averaged $950 and $2,030 in the last two quarters of 1987. The company said the average bonus for the quarter ended March 31 would be close to $5,000. **********Janet Greene, 35, an employee-relations clerk who has worked at Cain's plant in Orange, Tex., for 10 years, said the pay plan had a big impact on her and her colleagues. ''I feel it personally now,'' she said. ''I waste a lot less time.'' 'We Just Work as a Team' **********Mrs. Newton, who works at a plant in Victoria, Tex., said the output there had risen to about 60,000 pounds an hour from 50,000 pounds a year ago. ''I can talk to my plant manager any time,'' she said. ''We just work as a team. It's great.'' **********Other examples of improved productivity abound, Cain executives said. For example, refurbishing an ethylene plant in Corpus Christi took 21 days instead of the 35 days that had been anticipated, Gary L. Rosenthal, senior vice president for administration, said. **********The savings for the extra 14 days it was active amounted to about $4 million, he said. **********A shutdown for safety checks and maintenance at the Orange plant took 14 days instead of the expected 30 days, saving about $1.5 million. **********John W. Luchsinger, president of the Alathon polymers division, said the profit-sharing was ''all simple stuff really, but the guys really get interested in what's going on.'' Only $24 Million in Equity **********If working at Cain was a good deal for the blue-collar workers, it was an astounding deal for the founders and executives. In agreeing to pay $1.25 billion in cash for Cain, as well as to assume $1 billion of its debt, Occidental is offering twice the $1.1 billion that Cain's founders had raised to form the private company less than a year ago. The company's financing includes just $24 million in equity. **********If the acquisition is completed next month as planned, the equity of Cain investors would be multiplied by more than 44 times in less than a year, an impressive rate of return. **********Gordon A. Cain, the investor who assembled the target company through a novel series of debt-financed acquisitions last year, will pocket more than $100 million from an investment of $2.3 million. Three executives in charge of Cain's operations, who had paid $900,000 each for stock and options, will receive $39.9 million apiece. **********And 70 managers will split a pool of options worth an average of $2 million each. All but 90 of the 1,300 workers will share $155 million through an employee stock ownership plan, which owned 12 percent of the company. Workers who joined the company too late to qualify for the plan will receive an extra year's pay. Even those who declined to contribute to the plan will get $10,000. 'Just An Incredible Deal' **********''It's just an incredible deal,'' said Leslie C. Ravitz, a chemical-industry analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ''I asked Gordon at lunch yesterday if he wanted to adopt me.'' **********The Occidental purchase also promises lavish profits for the Chase Manhattan Bank and Morgan Stanley & Company, Mr. Cain's financial advisers, lenders and investment partners. Each expects to make $120 million, before taxes, from the sale. **********''It's extraordinary,'' said William Laverack, an associate at Morgan Stanley who worked on the Cain financing. ''That exceeds most everybody's objectives in this leveraged-buyout business.'' **********For all the largesse, many analysts believe Occidental, based in Los Angeles, did not pay too much for Cain, Bernard J. Picchi, an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers, said the Occidental offer was ''pretty inexpensive.'' **********If Cain were a public company, he said, Occidental might have been forced to pay as much as $2.5 billion in cash for it. Public Offer Was Considered **********In fact, Cain's directors were weighing an initial public offering when Occidental began negotiations in February for the purchase, said Mr. McMinn, Cain's president. **********An amalgam of seven modern petrochemical plants along the Gulf Coast of Texas, Cain was assembled in four transactions totaling $800 million in the first half of 1987. Industry analysts said it was brilliant timing. Companies were eager to sell the plants, which together lost $1 billion from 1982 through 1986. **********''Gordon Cain was a man of vision,'' said Mr. Ravitz of Salomon Brothers. ''He saw the industry turn before anyone else did. He bought these plants at the absolute bottom of the market.'' **********Mr. Cain, who is 76, formed a small investment bank in Houston, the Sterling Group, six years ago to sift through the wreckage of the battered refining and chemical businesses for potential survivors. His secretary at the Sterling Group said Mr. Cain was in New York over the weekend and was unavailable for comment. Industry Was Surging **********By the time Cain Chemical was formed last July, the petrochemical industry was surging. Supply and demand factors had dramatically shifted. Capacity had tightened, after the closing of dozens of aging plants since the early 1980's, and demand was on the rise in the United States and abroad. **********Prices for ethylene, high-density propylene and ethylene glycol, the three major products made by Cain, have nearly doubled. During the same period, crude oil costs fell, paring expenses for the major feedstock from which petrochemicals are derived. **********Using some of the untapped part of a $600 million credit line provided by 16 banks headed by Chase, Cain made several changes in the plants to raise output, he said. ''We got a whole slew of ideas'' from employees, he added, ''and we were able to move quickly.'' Changes Are Expected **********Working for Occidental would be different. The big oil and chemical company told Cain executives they would end the profit-sharing plan after next September. A spokesman for Occidental said company officials were not available to elaborate on their plans for Cain. **********Cain, however, was considering limits on the profit-sharing plan because the payments were sharply higher than any executives had expected, Mr. McMinn said. **********For now, Cain workers say they do not feel short-changed in light of the fortunes about to be realized by dozens of their bosses or by the prospect of an end in another five months to their quarterly bonus plan. **********''I'm impressed with someone who is intelligent enough to put together a deal like that and take those risks,'' said Mrs. Greene, the employee relations clerk, after she was told of the multimillion-dollar payoffs. **********''I want you to know Gordon Cain was outstanding,'' Mrs. Newton, the maintenance and repair worker, said. ''There aren't many people who will make that kind of money but also bring their people in with them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/06/business/company-news-bell-howell-sued.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell & Howell Sued", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bell & Howell Sued", "body_text": " **********The Bell & Howell Company faces seven shareholder lawsuits, contending that the company failed to negotiate fairly with all parties during the bidding that developed between the British publisher Robert Maxwell, the New York publishing company Macmillan Inc. and the Bass family of Texas.

A. Azizbekov grade school, a gray stone building overlooking the soccer stadium, is one of two schools in the Armenian capital where the members of the Azerbaijani minority can send their children to study in their native language. **********Despite decades of dwindling enrollment, city officials have kept the school open as a sign of their commitment to fraternal relations among people of different cultures. **********But these days the school is an eerie symbol of something gone awry in the official Soviet notion of ethnic coexistence. **********The spacious school now serves a student body of just nine children. Twenty of its students and three teachers moved away this summer, fleeing what Azerbaijanis say is a frightening rise of Armenian nationalism. Confrontation With Neighbor **********Already the most ethnically homogeneous of the Soviet Union's 15 republics - more than 90 percent of the population is Armenian - Armenia is experiencing a dramatic resurgence of national feeling aroused by months of tense confrontation with neighboring Azerbaijan. The trouble began as a territorial dispute over a small region populated predominantly by Armenians yet governed by Azerbaijan. **********It has been an intoxicating time for Armenians, but Azerbaijani stories of arson, threats and insults suggest that there is also darker side to the Armenian revival. **********''Azerbaijanis feel that they are not wanted here,'' said one longtime Azerbaijani resident, who declined to be quoted by name. ''The Armenians want only their own kind.'' **********According to official estimates, 20,000 of the 170,000 Azerbaijanis living on Armenian territory have left for Azerbaijan this year. Their departure is part of a two-way exodus driven by the recent unrest, which started as a dispute over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh but has fueled nationalist fires and turned into a severe domestic challenge for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Called Isolated Incidents **********Armenian officials acknowledge that acts of arson and threats have been directed against Azerbaijanis, but they insist these are isolated incidents, insignificant compared with what Armenians have suffered at the hands of Azerbaijanis. **********''All the Azerbaijanis live here peacefully and without incident,'' said Vladimir B. Galumyan, an Armenian Communist Party leader and deputy chairman of the republic's legislature. ''There is a lot of ridiculous talk, and there are people who deliberately plant such stories.'' **********The authorities in Moscow have long tolerated an unusual degree of national self-consciousness in Armenia. **********The Russification common in other republics is minimal here. Armenian language predominates in the streets, and 80 percent of the students in Yerevan study in Armenian-language schools, with Russian as a mandatory second language. More Religious Latitude **********Armenians are generally given greater latitude than most other nationalities to practice their Orthodox Christian religion, to maintain contacts with Armenians in the far-flung diaspora, and to celebrate their own history. But those considered too outspoken in their calls for self-determination have been sent to prisons and labor camps. **********Perhaps the most revered landmark in the city is the hilltop spire and eternal flame commemorating the 1915 massacre of Armenians by the Turks - an event at the center of the Armenian sense of victimization. **********The territorial dispute with Azerbaijan, and especially the anti-Armenian riots in February in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, have aroused the Armenians' ancient sense of themselves as an embattled people, and have given birth to new nationalistic demands ranging from the creation of an all-Armenian army detachment to complete independence. **********Armenians say there is nothing hostile in the resurgence of national pride. indeed, a visitor finds an exciting sense of people whose craving for liberty has been newly awakened. Vengefulness Is Felt **********But there is also an unmistakable exclusiveness, bitterness and even vengefulness in the mix of passions. **********Some of the Armenians who have recently moved to the republic, including refugees from Sumgait, say they are scorned by local residents because they sent their children to Russian schools and generally became too assimilated. **********Azerbaijani residents, the largest minority in the republic, say they have felt distinctly unwelcome since the tensions began in February. **********Nothing has happened in Armenia to match the horror of the riots in Sumgait, which left 32 people dead, but investigators from the federal procurator's office have reported that since then there have been many cases of persecution on both sides. **********One Azerbaijani woman, interviewed in the presence of two officials, described how vandals wrecked her sister's house and set fire to the doors of the homes of her brother and two nephews, including one in central Yerevan. She then pleaded that her name not be used because of possible reprisals. **********Other Azerbaijanis told of relatives driven from their jobs by threats or refused service by Armenian shopkeepers. Disregard and Hatred **********The official response is to deny or play down these instances. **********''Maybe there were such cases,'' shrugged Rem G. Ananikyan, deputy head of the official press agency Armenpress. ''Or maybe they burned their own houses. How can you tell?'' **********A visitor heard disdain, and sometimes undisguised hatred, directed at the Azerbaijani minority. **********A prominent Yerevan cultural figure, an urbane and charming man, offhandedly commented during a dinner conversation that ''we are a nation surrounded by barbarians.'' **********Another Armenian, part of a cluster of men gathered on a downtown street for a nightly retelling of the grievances against Azerbaijan, loudly called for Christian nations to band together against the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis, who, he declares, ''breed like cockroaches.'' **********Each night at a park near the city opera house, students display pictures of the Armenians killed in Sumgait. The six Azerbaijanis who died innocently in the riots are not included, because, Armenians say, their deaths were incidental to the real crime. **********At the school named for M. A. Azizbekov, an Azerbaijani revolutionary hero, the Azerbaijani principal, Tagiyeva Nadzhiba, did not want to speak of such unpleasantness. She said her remaining students were treated warmly when they went to the adjoining Armenian school for cafeteria or sports. **********Asked about the people who left, she answered nervously: ''They were afraid. They exchanged their apartments and moved to Azerbaijan.'' **********An Armenian official from the city council quickly interjected, ''But you don't want to move away, do you?'' **********''No,'' she said.

Kekula, a Liberian ophthalmologist, it made up for professional journals lost in the mail and for advanced American training he could not afford. **********The object of their praise was a six-year-old traveling program run from a sleek white DC-8 parked at the airport here outside Mali's capital. The tail markings - a white eye painted inside a blue globe - indicated its purpose: teaching up-to-date ophthalmological techniques to doctors and nurses in the third world. **********Since first taking flight in March 1982, the project, known as Orbis and largely financed by the United States, has visited 51 countries, taught 5,000 doctors and restored sight to 6,000 patients. Crucial Tool for Africans **********''We cannot afford to go to the United States,'' said Dr. Kekula, who is director of eye care services for the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Liberia. ''Orbis's coming to the third world is very, very important to us.'' **********Although there are 45 million blind people worldwide, most doctors in poorer nations cannot afford to travel overseas for refresher courses. Even if they could, they increasingly encounter licensing laws prohibiting them from perfecting surgical techniques. **********''A doctor from Mali can't go to London to perform surgery,'' said Oliver I. Foot, the executive director for Project Orbis, which has its headquarters in New York. ''At best, he can only look over another doctor's shoulder.'' **********Instead, this cramped jetliner, a 13-foot-wide craft that first flew in 1960, has been transformed into a classroom capable of teaching hundreds of medical professionals at once. Very Much a Hospital **********The plane, once a United Airlines passenger carrier, has an 18-seat classroom in the foresection. The rest of it has been transformed into a miniature hospital: a patient examination and laser treatment area, a surgical scrub room, an operating theater equipped with microsurgical equipment, a four-cot recovery area, and an audio-visual center with $1 million worth of equipment. **********In the classroom, local doctors watch live surgery on a video monitor and ask questions of a chief surgeon, who wears a microphone clipped to his mask. **********To handle an overflow of students, Oswald E. Font, the project's audio-visual producer, routinely turns unused airport buildings into classroom annexes, complete with video monitors and a two-way sound link to the plane. **********Orbis generally visits a country for three weeks, enough time for most doctors to get a turn trying new surgical techniques under the supervision of visiting Western surgeons. 'Get Your Hands Wet' **********''From the educational perspective, it is the best way to teach eye surgery - you get cases, then go in and get your hands wet,'' said Steven J. Laukaitis, the project's medical director. **********Orbis personnel said their visit to Peru in 1983 led to legislative changes permitting the transplantation of corneas from cadavers. A trip to Beijing in 1985 introduced ophthalmic microsurgery in China. **********''They purchased the same operating microscope that was on board the Orbis airplane,'' Dr. Jack M. Dodick, chief ophthalmologist of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, wrote Orbis after a second visit to Beijing. **********In addition to improving local skills, Orbis engineers routinely leave the plane to repair broken microscopes and other ophthalmic equipment in local hospitals. Fringe Benefits Left **********Mr. Foot said that Orbis also commonly leaves behind $50,000 to $100,000 worth of equipment donated by pharmaceutical companies - sutures, instruments and intraocular lenses. The audio-visual studio also donates radio and television public service messages in local languages on proper eye care. **********The trip to Mali was the fourth Orbis visit in six years to West Africa - a region plagued by high rates of blindness resulting from cataracts, glaucoma and trachoma, among other causes. **********The United Nations Development Program, impressed by earlier visits, helped to make this trip a regional affair by paying the airfares and hotel expenses for 73 physicians and nurses from 11 West African countries. **********The United Nations contribution amounted to about $70,000 - roughly what it would cost to send five African doctors to London for refresher courses. The United States Agency for International Development provides about one-third of Orbis' $6 million annual budget. A Way of Staying Current **********Dr. Kerkula, the Liberian surgeon, said he had participated in an Orbis visit in 1984 when he was a medical student in Nairobi. The only hospital of its kind, Orbis has become the primary means for African ophthalmologists to keep up with innovations in their field, he said, adding, ''Here we can see operations and then go into the operating room and get hands-on skills.'' **********In many African countries, a shortage of doctors means that ophthalmic nurses take on added responsibilities, including performing cataract operations - duties for which they may feel inadequately prepared. **********''After our initial training, we have not been anywhere,'' Sophia Kitcher, a Ghanaian nurse, said as her colleagues murmured approval of the refresher course.

The plot is nonexistent, the ending shamelessly predictable and the style sets the standard for wordiness. There's no chance of it becoming a mini-series. **********Yet millions of copies will be sold this year of that most ordinary of books - the dictionary. **********''There's this sense that a dictionary is something you buy once and never throw away,'' said William Llewellyn, president of Merriam-Webster Inc., which specializes in publishing dictionaries. ''I've got a dictionary at home from 1946 that for some reason I haven't bothered to throw out. But the fact is, people continue to buy new ones even though they have old ones lying around. The language, after all, keeps changing.'' **********The prosaic, dog-eared nature of dictionaries belies the fact that the books are consistent nonfiction best-sellers. Merriam-Webster of Springfield, Mass., a part of Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., says it sells more than a million copies a year of its Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the country's biggest-selling dictionary. First appearing in 1983, it has been a fixture on The New York Times best-seller list for 155 weeks and shows no signs of wilting. **********Just this month, Simon & Schuster, the publishing arm of Gulf and Western Inc., unveiled a third edition of its Webster's New World Dictionary, the first total revision of that dictionary in 17 years. Simon & Schuster invested seven years and $2 million in the overhaul and expects to be rewarded with a best seller, too. The second edition had been on The Times' list for 42 weeks. Some of the words or expressions making their debut in it include: cash cow, poison pill, camcorder, Denver boot, disposable income, play kissy-face, couch potato, insider trading, diddly squat, nerdy, beanbag chair, goombah, nut case, tooth fairy and schlump. **********It was Noah Webster, the versatile lexicographer, who brought dictionaries to prominence in this country. He published his first dictionary back in 1806: A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language. It had 37,000 entries, including skunk, hickory and applesauce. It was not until 1828, however, when he came out with his masterpiece, An American Dictionary of the English Language, in two volumes. Two years later, competition threatened in the form of Joseph Worcester's Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language. The Webster volumes, however, prevailed in a bitter battle waged over several decades. In 1843, after Noah Webster's death, the rights to his word books were purchased by two brothers in Springfield, Mass., George and Charles Merriam, who were in printing and bookselling. Under their ownership, the dictionary blossomed into a major seller. **********Most people own dictionaries. A recent Gallup survey found that 89 percent of households owned a conventional dictionary. About 32 percent also had a foreign-language one, 20 percent a crossword puzzle dictionary, 12 percent a business dictionary and 8 percent a rhyming dictionary. **********The pervasiveness of dictionaries would imply that there is not much room for new sales. But driven by linguistic change and lured by new wrinkles publishers insert in dictionaries (lists of accredited colleges, world maps) and canny marketing, people keep buying more. (There are even people who collect dictionaries.) Scores of technical and scientific terms are coined every year, slang words keep springing up and gaining popularity, more words get borrowed from other languages. ''Our research has found that the average college dictionary is traded in, so to speak, every six years,'' said Philip Friedman, the associate publisher of Webster's New World Dictionary. ''The key thing people think about in dictionaries is the currency. They will pay for what's new.'' **********Dictionaries would not be anywhere as successful if they were not such ideal gifts to bestow on students. In fact, the hottest seasons for sales are Christmas time, the back-to-school period and graduation time. ''It's the sort of gift that people feel will be useful to anyone and isn't in bad taste to anyone,'' Mr. Llewellyn said. **********Another expanding part of the market is businesses, for Merriam figures it sells about a quarter of its college dictionaries through commerical stationery stores to offices. Simon & Schuster, which has not worked on that market too hard, is accelerating its efforts to businesses. **********No one has a good grasp of the dimensions of the dictionary market, since there are a few hundred different renditions - slang dictionaries, medical dictionaries, Bible dictionaries, sports dictionaries, Scrabble dictionaries, vest pocket dictionaries, pronouncing dictionaries and those unabridged dictionaries (like the gargantuan Oxford English Dictionary) clogged with all sorts of words you have never heard before. **********But the core of the business is the familiar college dictionary, a general book of about 150,000 to 200,000 entries written for college-level comprehension. Merriam-Webster figures that it accounts for sales of about two million hard-cover copies a year, or something like $35 million. Four principal hard-cover versions jostle for position in that market: Webster's Ninth New Collegiate, Webster's New World, the Random House College Dictionary and Houghton Mifflin's American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. **********Although publishers find the business to be remarkably stable, dictionaries have suffered their occasional tribulations. ''In the late 1960's and early 1970's, the market for college dictionaries in the college student market shrank substantially and got us worried,'' Mr. Llewellyn said. ''There was a lot of cafeteria-style education. The market shrank by probably a half. It had represented 25 percent or so of the overall market. Now it's about 10 percent. It never came back. But, fortunately, the rest of the market expanded.'' It may seem as if dictionary definitions are in the public domain, and all you have to do to create a dictionary is thumb through an existing one and start typing. It is true that there are not a great many ways to define shoe or mud, yet dictionary definitions are copyrighted. ''It's difficult to be wholly original in a dictionary,'' Mr. Llewellyn said. ''But if somebody takes our material and simply changes green to light green in a definition, there are concerns. People say, well, you don't own the words. That's absolutely true. But the selection of words - whether something goes in or doesn't go in - is an intellectual decision, which is why we copyright our word lists.'' **********There have been charges of piracy, starting with Noah Webster accusing Joseph Worcester of plagiarizing; it was never proved. But publishers believe stealing to be rare. **********Producing a dictionary is expensive. For Merriam's Collegiate, a higher-grade paper is used than in conventional books and a lot more of it (the dictionary is 1,563 pages), something like four pounds compared with about a half-pound for an average-length novel. A new edition requires two to two-and-a-half years of work by lexicographers. In all, the cost comes to $500,000 to $1 million. Once finished, as Mr. Llewellyn said, ''there aren't too many movie rights from a dictionary.'' **********On the other hand, there are no author royalties and a much longer bookstore life. ''If a trade book is successful,'' Mr. Llewellyn said, ''it will have a life of maybe six months. The dictionary has five to 10 years. A good number of the copies of every trade book are returned. Dictionaries are bread-and-butter items that won't have returns. Once you get over the initial front-end costs a couple of years out, the dictionary is infinitely more profitable than a trade book. Kroch's and Brentano's once said that pound-for-pound, the Merriam-Webster dictionaries are the biggest sellers in their stores. But the movie rights and book signings go to 'Red October.' '' **********Dictionary-making is never easy and never ending. To be a serious publisher, it is necessary to hunt constantly for new words and shades of meanings and to add and subtract words even between revisions. Merriam-Webster plans on a new edition every 10 years, but as new copies are printed, it makes several hundred small changes every year on some of the book's 160,000 entries. Simon & Schuster tinkers every two years. **********Frederick Mish, Merriam's editorial director, supervises a staff of 17 lexicographers. They are professional word hunters. The heart of the scholarly effort is a process Merriam refers to as ''reading and marking.'' Every day, the company expects its lexicographers to spend a minimum of an hour poring over newspapers, magazines and books, including novels, for unusual word usages. They even read such journals as Cat Fancy. What catches their eye are unfamiliar words and applications of words that seem to suggest fresh meanings. This work is done with the Collegiate Dictionary by their side, so they can confirm that what seems new is not in fact old. When something qualifies, then it is marked and handed in to typists who store it in both a computer and a paper file. This is referred to as a citation. **********Citations can come from almost anywhere. Staff members have carried in restaurant menus. They have brought in labels from canned foods. They have presented snapshots of billboards that they have spotted. Anybody can contribute. ''I was reading a report in the paper the other day,'' Mr. Llewellyn said, ''and it said that the 'economy was careering out of control.' I would have said 'careening,' but they said 'careering.' That became a citation.'' **********One publication can be remarkably generous in its supply of citations. ''A magazine like People would produce several hundred,'' said Mr. Mish. ''A book could produce 1,000 to 1,500 citations.'' In all, the staff adds 10,000 to 15,000 citations a month. ''Right now, the whole file consists of about 14 million of those little suckers,'' Mr. Llewellyn said. Citation reading tends to be less pleasurable than ordinary reading of the morning newspaper. ''You're paying less attention to the contents and more attention to the words, structure and grammar,'' Mr. Mish said. ''You can read something very closely and produce a fair amount of citations and at the end not have much sense of what you had read about. That can get to you.'' **********When the time comes to make revisions, the citations are divvied up and examined, and decisions are made on whether words should go in, or shades of meanings tinkered with. The determinations are done by feel rather than by formula. ''There's no magic number - 10 citations for a word and it goes in, 9 citations and it stays out,'' Mr. Mish said. ''Usually we would want to see a term in substantial use for at least three years. But there are exceptions. When Khomeini came to power, the word 'ayatollah' instantly came into use and so it went in. In the Ninth Collegiate, an example of a word that took a long time to get serious consideration was 'humongous.' We first came across it in the late 1960's on college campuses. But we didn't see it anywhere else, until it started to show up in political cartoons and advertisements and then in reputable newspapers. In 1983, after about 18 years, we finally put it in.'' **********Word work demands a certain sort of person. Mr. Mish spoke about the makeup of lexicographers: ''They have to be able to take the routine. There's a repetitive nature and a certain drudge aspect to lexicography. People sometimes have the notion that we do a lot of committee work, sitting around and deciding whether a word should go into the dictionary. We do some of that, but most of the work is done alone.'' **********Dictionaries pretty much sell themselves, although there has been a great deal of discounting and advertising in recent years during the peak sales times. What is more, publishers do try to differentiate their efforts by touting the currency of their book or the great clarity of their definitions. With the new edition of its college dictionary, Simon & Schuster has decided to go further and try to implant some of the razzle-dazzle of trade book publishing in dictionary marketing. **********To get its dictionary out of the musty back corners of bookstores where reference books normally reside, it has fashioned displays that hold 12 copies of the dictionary and contain entry forms for a sweepstakes. The forms offer a list of 10 words and then a column of 10 definitions. Contestant must match the definitions with the correct words; Simon & Schuster hopes people will not know them off the top of their heads but will need to buy the dictionary. The grand prize is $10,000 worth of reference material, including a computer. Besides staging the game, the publisher is sending Victoria E. Neufeldt, the dictionary's editor in chief, on a 12-city tour to promote it, just like Judith Krantz or Robert Ludlum. Ms. Neufeldt, though, is not expected to dodge questions about whether the book is thinly disguised autobiography. **********Like just about everything else these days, the dictionary has begun to appear in various electronic versions. Spelling checkers have been around for a number of years, but dictionaries for personal computers are now being sold. In March, Proximity Technology Inc., a linguistic software company, came out with ''Choice Words,'' an 80,000-word version of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary augmented with a thesaurus. It sells for $99. Proximity finds lots of secretaries and writers want definitions to pop up on the screen in seconds. **********Not that this endangers the trusty hard-cover. ''The hard-cover has remained pretty much unaffected by the paperback,'' Mr. Llewellyn said. ''So I imagine it will continue to sell even with electronic versions. It will always sell.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/07/business/the-media-business-investor-s-daily-learns-the-hard-way.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1988-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 872, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Investor's Daily Learns the Hard Way", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Investor's Daily Learns the Hard Way", "body_text": " **********Nearly five years after beginning a national financial newspaper, the owner of Investor's Daily is sobered by the experience. **********''We were a little naive about putting out a paper,'' said William J. O'Neil, who created a publication filled with charts and statistics that would capitalize on his 30 years of research on the stock market and the economy. **********His goal for the Los Angeles-based paper was 75,000 daily subscribers in the first year and profitability in the second. ''We weren't right,'' Mr. O'Neil said. **********Investor's Daily did reach its circulation goal, albeit more slowly than expected. Circulation in the six months ending Sept. 30 was 110,000 a day, up from 20,000 at the start in April 1984. Profitability is still at least two years and 90,000 more readers away, Mr. O'Neil said. **********Even as Investor's Daily struggles for recognition among readers and advertisers, the paper is facing a new challenge, one that it may unwittingly have had a hand in shaping. **********Some analysts say the paper recently received a grudging nod of respect from its primary rival, The Wall Street Journal, when the nation's largest financial newspaper revised its format and added a third section. **********The Journal's ''Money and Investing'' section includes more charts and graphs, and its stock and bond tables now use bold type or underlining to highlight issues with extraordinary price swings. **********The highlighting, in particular, appears modeled after the format begun at Investor's Daily, said Edward J. Atorino, a newspaper-industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. ''Clearly, that third section is aimed at Investor's Daily,'' he said. **********Charles N. Stabler, a spokesman for Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Journal, disagreed. ''These were things we did because we thought they made sense,'' Mr. Stabler said. ''It wasn't in response to Investor's Daily.'' **********Other publications, including The New York Times and USA Today, have significantly increased the staff and space devoted to financial news. A Form of Flattery **********Mr. O'Neil thinks Investor's Daily, which like The Journal is at 50 cents a copy in most areas, will gain in credibility because of what he sees as The Journal's imitation of his paper. Of The Journal's third section, he said, ''I don't think it will hurt us.'' **********It helps that Mr. O'Neil is wealthy. Former employees estimate that Investor's Daily is absorbing losses of $500,000 to $1 million a month. **********The 54-year-old self-taught financial analyst and adviser's worth is estimated at around $100 million. He earned his fortune on the stock market, learning business and economic trends while building computer programs to track 7,500 companies. William O'Neil & Company, a corporation separate from Investor's Daily, sells its research and charts to institutional investors. **********To some extent, the paper also relies on O'Neil research, offering to brokers, professional money managers and personal investors statistical data that are unavailable elsewhere. Investor's Daily's trademark is its many graphic histories of price and volume performance of top stock issues. The front page includes articles, usually written in a dry, straightforward manner, that fall into five categories: the top story, the economy, business, leaders and success, and the investor's corner. The remaining articles are short news items, many of them produced by wire services. The paper has an editorial staff of 45. **********Mr. O'Neil said the paper needs to double its circulation and its advertising linage, now at about 6.5 pages an issue, to become profitable. As the paper is privately owned, he declined to disclose revenues or losses. **********In contrast with most other national publications, Mr. O'Neil said, advertising revenue has risen since the first quarter, by 6 percent. He attributed the gain to market research studies completed in March that showed the paper is read by wealthy, well-educated professionals. Household income was found to average $195,000, with average net worth at $1.4 million, and 61 percent of the readers described themselves as in top management. The findings are being used in appeals to advertisers like Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz. **********But some analysts say the paper's growth potential is limited. ''Investor's Daily is a niche property for those who are interested in technical factors,'' said J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. **********And contrary to what Mr. O'Neil says, Mr. Noble and Mr. Atorino suspect the paper has suffered from sluggish advertising and a shrinking audience since the stock market crash a year ago. **********But circulation in March was 48 percent higher than it was a year earlier, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. **********Without eye-grabbing color or even sizable photos, Investor's Daily demands that its readers give it more than a glance. ''You're not going to curl up by the fireplace with it,'' said Dennis H. Cartwright, president and chief executive of Media General Inc.'s financial services unit and a subscriber.

They paid up to $35,000 a head to make the round trip and stayed on the ground for two to three hours, touring the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where about 75 people work at a research installation maintained by the United States. The tourists stopped to have coffee and buy one souvenir apiece. **********Dominating the flat white landscape, the South Pole Station, with its silvery 52-foot-high dome topped by an American flag and partly obscured by drifting snow, provides shelter for three main buildings that house science and communications facilities, galley and lounge space and living quarters for 40. **********With the Antarctic summer fast receding, there will be no more such flights until next year.

Many were over 60 years old and several had difficulty breathing here, where atmospheric conditions are the same as those at an altitude of 12,000 feet. Three of seven passengers on the first flight required bottled oxygen, according to Mike Constantine, the station manager, and four were unable to walk the 275 feet from the geodesic dome that houses the station back to their plane; they were driven in a station vehicle. **********Jim Butler, a Colorado scientist, objected to the tourist visits on environmental grounds. ''The community here is by and large environmentally aware,'' he said. ''But I still see cigarette butts. I'm not worried about what's happening right now.

Brezhnev. **********Instead of abandoning the dream of seeing Venezuela undergo profound social change, in 1971 Mr. Petkoff and two dozen other former Communists founded a new leftist party, the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, that had as its most radical precept the acceptance of the rules of democracy. **********Now, 17 years later, with Mr. Petkoff chosen to be its presidential candidate for elections in December, the movement is not only a permanent feature of Venezuelan politics but has also won recognition as the most successful example of the integration of former guerrillas into democracy anywhere in Latin America. Still Scorned by Marxists **********The controversy that has accompanied Mr. Petkoff's stormy life is not over. Local Marxists still charge the party with ''selling out'' to democracy in exchange for a few seats in Congress, while many Venezuelans continue to identify the party with Communism and violence. Further, in the last three elections, the partyu has not won more than six percent of the vote. **********Yet its relevance to Latin America is perhaps greater than its electoral success at home because, by breaking with Marxist dogma and Leninist practice, it has focused attention on the minimal popularity and ideological stagnation of most of the region's traditional leftist parties. **********''I think the MAS is about the only case of leftist renovation in Latin America,'' Mr. Petkoff, who is now 56 years old, said in an interview. ''Elsewhere, we see repetition of the same old ideas that simply serve to deepen the abyss between the left and the people.'' **********Certainly, at a time of dramatic economic and social crises in much of Latin America, there are few leftist parties that can claim significant a political following. Most Communist parties remain tied to Moscow while remnants of rebel groups defeated in the 1970's exercise minimal political influence. **********Similarly, while in the 1960's revolutionaries throughout Latin America were convinced that Fidel Castro's success could be repeated, in countries still convulsed by guerrilla warfare today, such as Colombia, Peru, El Salvador and Guatemala, the insurgents are not close to seizing power. In 1985, after almost four decades in arms, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia even formed a political front, the Patriotic Union, to take part in elections. A Failure of Ideas **********For Mr. Petkoff and other party leaders, however, the failure of the left in Latin America today represents the failure of its ideas rather than of its strategy, starting with its idealization of a Soviet regime that is a denial of democracy, passing through its own internal authoritarianism and climaxing in its promise of a ''dictatorship of the proletariat.'' **********Mr. Petkoff and his colleagues themselves went through many of these stages, but their achievement in forming a non-Marxist, nonviolent socialist party reflects the strong tradition of dissent that marked the Venezuelan Communist Party in the 1960's. **********In 1961, to the annoyance of Moscow, it was the only Communist Party in Latin America to take up arms, arguing that the military dictatorship ousted in 1958 had not given way to authentic democracy. And six years later, to the fury of Havana, it became the first Latin American guerrilla group to abandon the armed struggle before being thoroughly defeated. **********''We had adopted the Cuban model without criticism,'' recalled Mr. Petkoff, who graduated as an economist but still calls himself a professional revolutionary. ''But the people couldn't understand our uprising when the country was just returning to democracy. We invented a reality which justified the armed struggle, but we were going against the current of history.'' **********After the Communist Party abandoned guerrilla warfare, some dissident rebels continued fighting well into the 1970's, but their effect was minimal. Within the party, though, the ideological debate intensified, with a group that included Mr. Petkoff and other former guerrillas increasingly questioning the very maxims of Communism. Soviet Action 'a Shock' **********''The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was a shock,'' Mr. Petkoff said. ''We had organized protests against the United States invasion of the Dominican Republic so how could we persuade Venezuelans that an identically imperialist action by the Soviet Union should be applauded? I wrote a book, 'Czechoslovakia - Socialism as a Problem,' and it earned me a reference in Brezhnev's speech to the 24th Party Congress.'' **********But the turning point came in 1971 when the group decided to break with Leninism and form a new democratic party. ''This meant opening up to non-Marxists,'' he added. ''It also meant purging ourselves of dogma. We had always talked of social change in terms of models, but change is a process. The model idea only leads to enlightened vanguards that dictate to the people what is right and wrong.'' **********The party's campaign platform for this year's elections shows how much its ideas have developed since then. ''Democratic socialism opposes a state takeover of the economy,'' Mr. Petkoff, who is the son of Eastern European migrants, noted. ''We should have as much private initiative as possible and as much central planning as necessary. But, in guaranteeing equal opportunity, the state must provide education, health, culture and housing.'' **********The party's main challenge, though, is to win enough votes to make its ideas felt. ''Fear of Communism remains an obstacle, but polls show more people now view us as a center-left party,'' Mr. Petkoff said, adding that MAS hopes to improve on its 1983 performance when it won 10 of 180 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and two of 44 Senate races. ''But what's important is that we're now an established political current. Frankly, it's a miracle we have survived.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Alan Neadle was promoted to executive vice president at Princeton Partners. *********** Robert O'Brien and Joseph F.

Facsimile has been around for years and never really caught on. Now, however, it is suddenly becoming very popular, spurred by higher transmission speeds and widely discounted prices that make the equipment affordable for small businesses. **********Most of the major Japanese manufacturers, including Canon, Sharp and Toshiba, offer machines that list for $1,500 to $2,000. Murata Business Systems of Dallas introduced one that will sell for only $900. Many of the facsimile machines can also act as photocopiers and come with phones built in. **********With more electronic devices entering the home, it is only a matter of time before people will want to connect them together - so the computer can start the coffeepot, for instance. With that in mind, the NEC Corporation demonstrated a system for transmitting data at high speeds over the home's electrical wiring system, so the home office can also include a central command post."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/24/world/ortega-said-to-face-challenge-inside-his-regime.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1988-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ortega Said to Face Challenge Inside His Regime", "print_headline": "Ortega Said to Face Challenge Inside His Regime", "body_text": " **********Only a week after winning an important diplomatic victory at the summit meeting of Central American leaders, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra is facing an unexpected challenge from within his Sandinista regime. **********Sandinista demonstrators who broke up an opposition meeting Friday were organized without Mr. Ortega's knowledge, a senior aide to the President said. In a campaign to defeat American aid for the contras, Mr. Ortega has sought to portray his Government as moving toward full democracy. The President's associates say the internal confrontation has already begun to undermine efforts aimed at preventing continued United States financing for Nicaraguan guerrillas, known as contras. Congress is scheduled to vote Feb. 3 and 4 on an Administration request for new aid. **********Interior Minister Tomas Borge and his supporters are taking actions that convey an impression different from the political effort by Mr. Ortega. **********After last week's regional summit, Mr. Ortega surprised many diplomats and politicians by announcing major new political concessions. He lifted the six-year-old state of emergency under which civil and political rights had been restricted, and he abolished the people's tribunals that have convicted hundreds of suspected contras without normal judicial safeguards. **********By taking these steps, Mr. Ortega appeared to strengthen his argument that further aid for the contras was unnecessary because Nicaraguans were on the road to reconciliation. **********But while he was making the announcements at the Costa Rica summit, the Managua police began detaining opposition leaders to question them about a meeting they held with senior contras. The Nicaraguan police are under Mr. Borge's command, and officials said he had ordered the arrests without consulting Mr. Ortega. **********Associates of Mr. Ortega said he was upset by the episode. They said it had led some members of the United States Congress and other influential foreigners to doubt Nicaragua's commitment to political pluralism. **********The attack Friday on a meeting of relatives of prisoners was thought likely to have a similar effect. The attack was staged by members of Sandinista ''mass organizations'' that respond to Bayardo Arce, a Sandinista leader who has suppported Mr. Ortega. **********In an interview with American newspaper editors Friday afternoon, Mr. Ortega was asked about his relations with Mr. Borge and other senior Sandinistas. **********''We don't think exactly alike,'' he replied. But he said the Sandinista National Directorate remained a group of ''nine brothers.'' **********According to Sandinista officials, Mr. Borge and his allies are worried about the implications of easing restrictions on the opposition. **********''Tomas is sending a message, and the message is that you cannot be soft,'' one official said. **********Mr. Ortega and Mr. Borge have been the two leading figures in the Sandinista front for a decade. Mr. Borge's allies describe him as one of the three original Sandinistas, implying that since the other two are dead, he has moral authority over the movement. **********Mr. Borge, at 57 years old, is 15 years older than Mr. Ortega. He has perhaps the longest and most distinguished revolutionary record of any Sandinista. Scholars and other specialists who have studied Sandinista history identify him as among the more radical of the movement's leaders. **********His years of ''prolonged people's war,'' however, failed to bring the Sandinistas to power. It took a new strategy fashioned by Mr. Ortega, under which the Sandinistas built alliances with civilian politicians, labor leaders and businessmen, to accomplish that. **********Since assuming the presidency in 1984 , and especially in the last year, Mr. Ortega has worked to centralize power in his own hands. He reduced the authority of Interior Ministry combat units, and fashioned policies designed to show the outside world that Nicaragua was liberalizing. **********Mr. Ortega's ability to resist the will of Mr. Borge and others is limited. Sandinista leaders believe they must maintain unity at all costs, and none wants to provoke a serious conflict."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/18/business/gain-seen-in-us-japan-farm-negotiations.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1988-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gain Seen in U.S.-Japan Farm Negotiations", "print_headline": "Gain Seen in U.S.-Japan Farm Negotiations", "body_text": " **********The United States trade representative, Clayton K.

The remaining questions relate to periods of transition and safeguards during those periods to soften the shock of competition. Accord by Monday Expected **********Officials of both Governments said an agreement was likely by Monday. Such an accord would remove one of the biggest thorns in the economic relationship of the two countries while President Reagan and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita are attending the 14th annual economic summit conference, in Toronto. **********Japanese officials said that Mr. Takeshita wanted the longstanding dispute resolved before he holds a meeting with Mr. Reagan in Toronto at 4:30 Monday afternoon. **********A settlement would forestall criticism of Japan at a gathering at which Mr. Takeshita is expected to present evidence that his country is now more willing to accept the international responsibilities consistent with its huge and growing economic power. **********According to Japanese officials, the evidence includes a projected doubling of Japan's overseas aid over the next five years, during which time that country would displace the United States as the largest supplier of aid, and surging consumer spending and rising imports, which are helping to narrow Japan's trade surplus with the United States. **********As a sign of the importance of the beef and citrus issue, Mr. Takeshita and Mr. Reagan discussed it on June 3 in London when the President briefed the Japanese leader on his Moscow summit meeting. The two leaders agreed at that time to try to resolve the matter by their next meeting, Japanese officials reported. U.S. Stand on Subsidies **********President Reagan wants the matter settled not only because it means more exports. It also reinforces an American position, expected to be restated in Toronto, calling for the total removal of $200 billion of global farm subsidies over the next decade. **********An American negotiating team, led by the deputy United States trade representative, Michael B. Smith, has been in Tokyo for the last week, but it was only late Thursday night that the signal came of a possible breakthrough, justifying the Yeutter trip. **********To protect politically powerful Japanese farmers, the Japanese Government has maintained quotas on beef and citrus throughout the postwar period. For the Japanese fiscal year ended March 31, these quotas limited imports to 214,000 tons of beef, 126,000 tons of oranges and 8,500 tons of orange juice. **********Washington has insisted that because of Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, Tokyo has no right to maintain any restrictions on American imports, and has threatened to open proceedings against Japan under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such proceedings could lead to international sanctions. **********According to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, a framework agreement has been reached in which the beef quota would be eliminated over the first three years. A new tariff on imported beef would be levied over the next three years, with the tariffs declining each year. **********But there were still several sticking points, including the Japanese wish to retain rights to raise the tariff again after six years and to impose temporary import restraints if the liberalization has too great an impact on Japanese agriculture. **********Settlement of the beef and citrus dispute follows resolution of another longstanding trade fight earlier this year when Japan and the United States signed an agreement permitting American construction companies to enter the tightly restricted Japanese market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/business/company-news-hyundai-to-fight-canadian-ruling.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hyundai to Fight Canadian Ruling", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Hyundai to Fight Canadian Ruling", "body_text": " **********The Hyundai Corporation said it would continue to sell its cars in Canada despite a Canadian ruling that the auto maker was dumping its product by selling it at a lower price than it charged in South Korea.

The committee, he said, would consist of representatives from the two factions and from Syria and Iran.

Under the cease-fire, Syrian troops set up roadblocks there but whole sectors remained virtually under Party of God domination. **********Iran's solidarity with the Party of God has alienated Amal followers, prompting Mr. Berri to say the reconciliation should not be with the Party of God ''but between Iran and Lebanese Shiites.'' **********Iran is the center of Shiite power, and Shiites in general revere the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious leader. **********Mr. Bisharati arrived here two days after the spiritual head of the Lebanese Shiites, Sheik Mohammed Mahdi Chamseddin, went to Teheran to seek help in ending the confrontation between Amal and the Party of God.

The Party of God said it would not do that unless Amal lifted its restrictions in southern Lebanon.

Howard Sutton, senior research associate of the Conference Board, a business research organization, discovered this by doing a study, ''Competitive Intelligence,'' that the board issued this week. **********More and more companies, he said, realize the need for what he calls ''peripheral vision,'' or knowing what competitors are doing. **********In an interview he cited supporting evidence: new books on the topic; more seminars; the two-year-old Society of Competitor Intelligence Professionals, which now has more than 500 members from 300 companies in six nations, and a growing number of intelligence consulting firms. **********John Rhode, marketing vice president for Combustion Engineering Inc., said, ''Next to knowing what customers want, the most important thing is to know what competitors are doing.'' **********Many companies have long done informal intelligence gathering in marketing research departments, relying on what Mr. Sutton calls ''salesmen in the trenches'' who talk to customers, track counter space for products, and relay trade gossip. Companies also make laboratory tests of competitive products. Now the trend is toward more sophistication. **********The Conference Board study indicated that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has one of the biggest and liveliest systems. ''We try to make data-gathering part of everyone's job,'' said Blaine E. Davis, A.T.&T. vice president for strategic and market planning. **********Intelligence experts need ''analytical skills along with imagining skills,'' to hunt out sources of information, Mr. Sutton said. He also mentioned ''a political aspect,'' in that the intelligence director must have ''clout'' with members of top management so that they will pay heed to the data collected. **********Mr. Sutton said that, at several companies, including Motorola Inc., intelligence directors had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, and William L. Sammon, who until recently headed the Pfizer Inc. unit, had training in military intelligence. Mr. Sammon is now a securities analyst for Wood Gundy Inc. **********''Possibly an M.B.A. in marketing would be good for a beginner.'' Mr. Sutton added. **********Besides the sales force's contribution, routine information comes from trade shows, magazines, newspapers, annual reports over a period of years and talks with stock analysts. Checking tax and real estate records can indicate if a competitor has construction plans; court records can be valuable. This information needs integration and analysis. **********Beyond and above such obvious sources, he said, imagination comes into play: One company flew an airplane over a competitor's plant with an observer to count parked cars, trucks and smokestacks. Another intelligence head dispatched observers to count trucks in and out of a plant for several days. **********The Madrid office of a company reported that a large number of a competitor's employees had been assigned to Spain. From this the intelligence sector deduced accurately that the competitor planned to open a large unit in South America once its employees learned the Spanish language and culture. **********Local plants often offer public tours, which give competitors a chance to slip experts into the tour groups to observe the number of shifts working, age and types of equipment, inventory and other key factors. **********Japanese companies, whose intelligence activities are highly developed, station people with tape recorders on commuter trains to pick up careless conversation. **********While spying on the enemy is as ancient as mankind, the American company that probably pioneered a formalized corporate intelligence system was Motorola. Its former chairman, Robert Galvin, served on the Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board during the mid-1970's. He concluded that multinational companies could benefit from intelligence capabilities. Five years ago he chose Jan B.

Its three functions were collection and reporting, information services and analysis. **********Organizing an intelligence unit could take three years ''because of culture barriers and resistance to change,'' Mr. Herring added.

Burke  President and chief operating officer, Capital Cities/ABC Inc. **********The downward trend for network viewership is going to continue but the level of decline will moderate. Cable's penetration is improving, they now have about 82 percent of the homes in the United States, but they're running out of new markets. We know the networks don't do well in the homes with cable and with premium cable services. **********Businesswise, I don't think we'll have a particularly good year. The combination of the Calgary and Seoul Olympics will put pressure on advertising budgets for the rest of the year. We're very cautious.  Dennis J. Londoner  Vice president, Wertheim, Schroder & Company. **********We're getting a big drop-off in network viewing time - although what is real and what is due to the new 'people meter' measurements, we can't yet tell. Cable will steal more viewers this year because cable is producing better programs. **********The rise of the independent stations is also hurting the networks. But this is stabilizing because the best shows are getting too expensive for the independents to buy. My projection is that NBC will be No. 1 in ratings, ABC will be No. 2 and CBS a close third. This means CBS will have to put a lot of money into developing new shows. **********As to profitability, ABC will be profitable but will reflect the cost of its acquisition by its parent company Capital Cities Broadcasting. I don't follow the General Electric Corporation, the parent of NBC, but earnings for Capital Cities/ABC will be about $23 a share this year. Earnings for CBS will be about $10 a share.  Richard J. MacDonald  Director-equity research, First Boston Corporation. **********The number of viewers will be down for the networks this year. These viewers will be going over to the basic cable services and to cable news and sports - the advertising-supported cable services. Sunday night football on ESPN has been doing very well, especially among male viewers. The Fox television network also has had an impact on network viewing. **********But profitability should be O.K. for the networks this year. NBC will do well, ABC respectably, and CBS will break even. With the Olympics and the elections, this should have been a dynamite year - not just an O.K. year. The 1988-89 season will show a dramatic decline in revenue and CBS will feel the decline more than the others.

Isacsson  Executive vice president, Young & Rubicam Inc. **********This is a transitional year for the networks. We are learning how to evaluate the people meter and estimate audience shares. There is no doubt that the number of network viewers is down. Cable claims it gained a lot of these viewers, but most have gone to the independent stations and ''superstations.'' **********At the networks, daytime programming is suffering. Advertisers don't have confidence in daytime TV's women audiences anymore. They want other audiences. Because the networks guarantee ratings, or refund portions of an advertiser's fee, they will have some large potential liabilities this year. **********The problem for the networks will come in the 1988-89 season. With the Olympics and the Presidential elections over, the networks will have a lot of time to sell and will have to sell it at lower rates.

Polls Have Borja Ahead **********Recent polls suggest that Mr. Borja, who was defeated in runoffs in 1979 and 1984, is now the favorite, but both foreign diplomats and independent politicians here believe that Mr. Bucaram, in his first bid for the presidency, also stands a good chance of winning. **********As in the two previous elections since democracy returned here in 1979, regional rivalry is expected to play an important role Sunday. Mr. Borja, who comes from Quito, the capital, gets most of his support from mountain areas, while Mr. Bucaram, a former mayor of Guayaquil, the port city, is expected to sweep coastal regions. **********Political uncertainty generated by the campaign has already bruised this country's depressed economy, with the value of the local currency slumping from 270 to 490 sucres to the dollar in just three months. Further, with Ecuadorean businessmen distrustful of both candidates, prospects for an early economic recovery look slim. Government Candidate Defeated **********In the first round of voting, the main conservative flag-bearer, Sixto Duran, who had the backing of the Government party, ran a poor third among the 10 candidates. His defeat apparently was a backlash against the austere economic policies and authoritarian political style of President Leon Febres Cordero. **********Both Mr. Borja and Mr. Bucaram have also promised to change the pro-American foreign policy adopted by the departing Government by aligning Ecuador more closely with other Latin American democracies. Diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, which were broken by President Febres Cordero, seem certain to be restored after the change of administrations Aug. 10. **********During the campaign for the runoff election, however, attacks on the Febres Cordero Administration have been replaced by an intense war of insults, which has dismayed many Ecuadoreans even though they are accustomed to heated and at times violent political debate. Bucaram's Verbal Offensive **********The verbal offensive was launched by Mr. Bucaram, who sought to portray Mr. Borja as effeminate and as an alcoholic, a drug addict, an oligarch and an atheist, and to project himself as macho and as a devout Christian and savior of the poor. **********At first, Mr. Borja, who is 53 years old, tried to address more substantive issues, but eventually he began responding to what he described as Mr. Bucaram's ''whorehouse language'' by charging that his challenger was a mad, irresponsible liar with a messianic fixation. Each candidate dismisses the other's charges.  At the age of 36, Mr. Bucaram is already a well-practiced combatant in the populist arena, and Mr. Borja fared poorly, unable to shake off his image as a dull orator, a machine politician and an aloof man who looks uncomfortable mixing with the poor. **********Mr. Bucaram, in contrast, has shown himself to be an extraordinary campaign showman. He has drawn huge crowds and excites listeners with wild and often vulgar language. He has also met quietly with small groups of businessmen and diplomats in the hope of assuring them of his moderation. 'Not Things of a Madman' **********Describing his campaign as ''the force of the poor,'' Mr. Bucaram has also skillfully exploited Mr. Borja's charge that he was mad. He mounted a public relations effort to show that his myriad promises - among them, to double the minimum wage, to create a Ministry of Indians and to give shoes to all children - ''are not things of a madman.'' **********But Mr. Bucaram's verbosity has also brought him problems. In 1984, he fled into exile in Panama for two years after insulting the armed forces. And, with many Ecuadoreans still uncertain whether the armed forces are now willing to accept a Bucaram presidency, he has taken gratuitous swipes at the Defense Minister during the current campaign. **********In an interview with a Spanish newspaper last February, Mr. Bucaram also said that ''in matters of political organization, Hitler is one of the greatest geniuses that humanity has produced.''

Unmanaged care involves conventional plans without such controls. **********The survey, notable for the size and breadth of its sample (771 employers large and small, public and private), was conducted a year ago to draw a picture of the changes in group health insurance in the 1980's. It finds that many employers have taken major steps in an attempt to control health care costs without damaging the quality of care. But with medical costs now rising at 20 percent or more annually for some employers, there is still a long way to go. **********Among the most significant findings is that ''managed care last year became the mainstream in group health insurance,'' said Jon R. Gabel, an associate director of the Health Insurance Association of America. The association, which represents health insurers, participated in the study with researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina. The results will be published in the summer issue of Health Affairs magazine. More precisely, the survey found that 16 percent of Americans with group health insurance were enrolled in health maintenance organizations, which provide care at a pre-set price. Eleven percent were enrolled in preferred provider organizations, in which medical providers offer services at a discount. And 32 percent were in fee-for-service plans with controls like requiring permission to enter the hospital. **********What might be more surprising to companies that have struggled to hold down costs even with managed care arrangements in place is that 40 percent of Americans covered by an employer are still in unmanaged plans. But that number is shrinking rapidly as additional conventional plans adopt utilization review procedures. For example, in the latest survey, 44 percent of enrollees in conventional plans were covered by pre-admission certification requirements aimed at reducing unnecessary admissions to the hospital, up from about 20 percent the year before and 5 percent three years earlier. **********The survey also asked employee benefit managers how satisfied they were with their health plans. Almost 60 percent said they were ''very satisfied'' with their conventional fee-for-service plans, compared with 50 percent for preferred provider networks and 35 percent to 45 percent for different types of health maintenance groups. **********Employees were more positive about health maintenance organizations. In a separate survey of 1,500 people, the health insurance association found that almost four-fifths of the people in every kind of plan were satisfied with the quality of the care they received. But when it came to the cost and benefits of the plans, about three-quarters of the health maintenance enrollees said they were ''highly satisfied,'' compared with fewer than half under conventional and preferred provider plans. **********''Employees seem happier with H.M.O.'s than employers,'' Mr. Gabel said. ''The employers feel the H.M.O.'s do not provide them with enough data on how their employees are using the services -on how the money is being spent. Also, employers think that their healthier employees are choosing the H.M.O.'s and their sicker employees the conventional plans, yet the employer must pay the same premium to both under the usual interpretation of Federal regulations governing H.M.O.'s.'' **********The survey of benefits managers also found that self-insurance grew in popularity for conventional health plans, with 52 percent of the employers under such arrangements, up from 46 percent in 1984. Many employers have chosen to self-insure rather than use outside carriers because this exempts them from certain state taxes and laws, allows them to earn interest on reserves held to pay claims, and makes it easier for them to save money when their employees are healthier. But self-insurance also means more risk, and some employers are now looking for ways to share it with insurance carriers and medical providers. **********An expanded association survey is being conducted of almost 2,000 employers, and results are expected this summer. The association hopes this new survey will show which kinds of health plans fared best under the sharply higher inflation of the last year. It will also try to determine whether employers in states where hospital rates are more heavily regulated, like New York and New Jersey, and in states where there is more competition from health maintenance organizations and preferred providers, like California and Minnesota, fared better or worse in controlling costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/25/world/plane-supplying-contras-crashes-11-believed-killed-nicaragua-plane-struck.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Trainor", "pub_date": "1988-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 571, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "11 BELIEVED KILLED IN NICARAGUA; Plane Struck by Missiles", "print_headline": "PLANE SUPPLYING CONTRAS CRASHES; 11 BELIEVED KILLED IN NICARAGUA; Plane Struck by Missiles", "body_text": " **********The contra supply plane that crashed in southern Nicaragua on Saturday was hit twice by Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles, foreign reporters taken to the scene today were told. **********The wreckage was in heavy jungle 25 miles east of San Carlos, a small town on the shores of Lake Nicaragua, and about four miles north of the Costa Rican border. **********Most of the plane had been destroyed by the impact and a subsequent fire.

Excluding the charge, earnings rose 12.7 percent, to $1.33 billion, or $2.24 a share.

The Cypriot authorities did not act on the request, and early this morning, the pilot of the jet said that the hijackers had started beating passengers after a refueling deadline had passed. The hijackers also said six of the pasengers were ''sick.'' 'We Will Land in the Sea' **********Before receiving permission to land in Larnaca, Cyprus, the plane had circled Beirut, a brief flight away across the Mediterranean. **********The captain radioed the control tower in the Lebanese capital, saying there was a gun to his head and he wanted to land, according to Lebanese radio monitors. **********''If you fail to clear the runways within a few minutes, we will land in the sea,'' the pilot told the Beirut tower, according to The Associated Press. **********''Do whatever you want,'' came the reply. ''Crash on the tarmac or in the sea. We shall not let you land here.''  [ Excerpts from exchange, page 8. ]  Syrian troops blocked approach roads to the Beirut airport and were said by witnesses to have fired two warning shots at the plane as it circled overhead. The Syrians and the Lebanese Government apparently wanted to show that the airport was not the haven for hijackers that it once was. The Syrian authorities also made clear that Damascus airport was closed to the hijacked airliner. **********The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked to Meshed, Iran, on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Tuesday. **********The Iranian authorities said they were reluctant to permit the plane to take off. Early Friday, they were reported to have declared a state of emergency at Meshed airport and ordered security forces to full alert. **********According to the Iranian press agency, the hijackers threatened to blow up the plane, forcing the airport authorities to remove obstacles preventing take-off. The agency said the hijackers had earlier fired three warning shots and tossed a grenade from the plane. **********The hijackers, thought to number at least six, are demanding the release of 17 Shiite Moslems jailed in Kuwait for a wave of sabotage attacks in 1983, during which the United States and French embassies were bombed. **********''Iranian officials have told the hijackers that all the airports in the world will be closed to them,'' the Iranian press agency said before the plane left Meshed. While there, 57 passengers, including Britons and Japanese, were released. **********One of them, an Irishman named Kieran O'Kelly , said in a published interview Friday that the hijackers were ''very determined young men who are quite willing to die.'' Hijackers' Identity Unknown **********Some reports have linked the hijackers to the Party of God, a pro-Iranian Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist group. But their precise identities have not been established. One was said to have spoken with an accent familiar in eastern Lebanon, in some parts of which pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists have established a power base. **********Those passengers remaining on board, mainly Kuwaitis and other Arabs, were said to include three members of Kuwait's ruling royal family. **********The jumbo jet left Meshed early Friday afternoon and headed for Beirut. But, according to monitored exchanges between the control tower and the plane, the pilot was told he would be fired upon if he tried to land. **********Airline buses and fire trucks were parked on the runways to prevent the plane from landing, witnesses in the Lebanese capital said. **********''A gun is pointed to my head,'' the captain said, according to radio monitors in Lebanon who followed the exchange with the control tower. ''I request landing permission to refuel.'' 'Plane Will Be Fired On' **********''We have been for 14 years under gunfire,'' a control tower official was said to have replied, apparently in reference to Lebanon's civil war and related turmoil. ''If you try to land by force, the plane will be fired on.'' **********The aircraft then apparently turned for Cyprus, which, like Turkey, had also refused permission for it to land. **********The 747 had last refueled at Meshed, and its pilot said fuel supplies were running low. ''I'll never forget this, thank you,'' he was quoted as saying as he received clearance to land in Cyprus. **********By mid-evening Friday, the plane was parked on the edge of a runway, illuminated only by dim side lights. **********The Cypriot authorites declared a state of emergency at the airport as the hijacked plane made its final approach. 'I Have Lives at Risk' **********Earlier, in Beirut, the situation was tense. **********''I beg you, I kiss your hand, but please let me land,'' the pilot, an Iraqi, told the Beirut tower at one point. ''I beg you. I have human lives at risk.'' **********The answer was the same: ''The airport is closed, and you cannot land.'' **********The captain then shouted: ''God help us. We are turning off the radio, and we are going to land regardless. Please send ambulances.'' **********When the jumbo jet descended to an altitude of 2,000 feet above the Beirut airport's western runway, the authorities dimmed all lights, and quickly the aircraft began to gain altitude. It was unable to land. A Threat From Hijacker **********Then one of the gunmen on board radioed: ''I hereby warn - no, threaten - all responsible Lebanese. We are determined to land at Beirut, and if you stop us you will be responsible for the consequences that would befall the passengers.'' **********The dialogue between the seized aircraft and the tower was picked up by local radio stations. Many Lebanese abandoned their television screens to listen to the drama that was taking place above their heads. **********At one stage, the passengers came on the line to plead for their lives, their shouts and cries clearly heard in the background. A passenger who spoke identified himself as Jassem al-Jaber, one of the members of the Kuwaiti royal family. ''Please, please let us land,'' he said. ''Our lives are in jeopardy.'' **********The answer from the tower was, ''Emotions will not alter the situation.'' Different From June 1985 **********The situation at the Beirut airport is different from what it was in June 1985, when a Trans World Airlines jetliner was hijacked to the airport and 39 American passengers held hostage for two weeks. An American sailor was killed. **********At that time, Shiite Moslem militiamen were in control of the airport and surrounding areas. **********In February 1987, about 7,000 Syrian soldiers deployed in mainly Moslem West Beirut to end militia anarchy. They also took control of the airport and all access routes to it. **********From Cyprus, the plane's next voyage - if there is to be one - is not clear. The Cypriot authorities, economically dependent on tourism, want to avoid any suggestion that their island is a haven for terrorists, and seem to have acted under humanitarian pressure in permitting the plane to land."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/12/business/advertising-grey-is-winner-for-u-s-west.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Siler", "pub_date": "1988-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Grey Is Winner For U S West", "print_headline": "Advertising; Grey Is Winner For U S West", "body_text": " **********Grey Advertising, Los Angeles, has come out the winner in the three-month competition for the U S West Inc. corporate advertising business, with a budget of $10 million.

The inflation rate for 1987 was 4.4 percent. **********What is more, Federal economists estimate that health care will cost the nation $541 billion this year, up 8.2 percent from 1987. And the total will rise 9.1 percent to $590 billion in 1989. **********''Medical costs in this country are out of control,'' said David F. D'Alessandro, president of the corporate sector of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston. **********Indeed, health spending accounted for 11.1 percent of the gross national product in 1987, up from 9.1 percent in 1980, and some experts see it rising to 15 percent in the 1990's. That increases in this area of spending are almost twice the general inflation rate, which has been between 4 and 5 percent for two years, is a reflection not only of higher prices but of greater use of medical services. **********To be sure, Americans want good health care, said Dr. William L. Roper, the Federal Medicare administrator. But ''underneath that, there is widespread doubt among individuals and national leaders,'' he said. ''We're not getting full value. We need to do a better job of spending this large amount of money. How do we get better value -for example, improving our infant mortality record - without devoting more money to health care.'' **********Finding a way to restrain costs will be ''a major focus of the new Administration and Congress,'' Dr. Roper said. **********Health-care economists, insurance executives and senior Government officials said the Bush Administration and Congress would be under pressure to adopt more drastic curbs next year. Measures under study include caps on Medicare spending, nationally and by states or regions; pre-set physician fees, and the use of computerized programs that would deny payment for medical services deemed unnecessary or inappropriate. **********Federal spending on health will grow 20 percent from 1987 to 1989, much faster than the other major budget items, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. For example, military spending is expected to rise 5.7 percent, Social Security spending 12.4 percent and interest expenses on the national debt 17.8 percent, the budget office said. **********All told, government paid 41 percent of the nation's health bill in 1987, while private insurers paid 34 percent and individual patients 25 percent, according to the Health Care Financing Administration. **********The Federal Government and private insurers have succeeded in restraining hospital costs by setting ceilings on the fees paid for treatment of various types of illnesses. But overall costs have continued to soar, despite intermittent attempts by the Government to freeze physician fees and to keep doctors from charging patients more than Medicare pays. **********Experts attribute the cost surge to factors including the aging of the population, expensive new medical technology, questionable procedures to protect against malpractice lawsuits, aggressive marketing by medical providers and a 45 percent increase in the number of physicians - to more than 570,000 today from 393,742 in 1975. **********''Patients insist on high-technology treatment, and the providers make money every time they give it to them,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist and professor of political economy at Princeton University. **********Medicare and private insurers have had some success in reducing the amount of time patients spend in hospitals. As a result, the number of hospital beds has declined and economically pressed hospitals have closed - 79 last year and 75 in 10 months of this year. Some Problem Areas **********But ''outpatient'' visits to hospitals - ones in which the patient does not stay overnight - were up 7.1 percent earlier this year. ''The number of visits to doctors, tests and diagnostic procedures have exploded,'' said Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurer trade group in Washington. **********Any savings from controlling costs in hospitals has been more than wiped out by the growth in other types of care. **********''There has also been an enormous increase in claims costs for psychological and psychiatric therapy and alcohol and drug treatment,'' said Mr. Schramm, who suggested that hospitals have been expanding their activities in these areas to make up for lost revenues. **********Alexander H. Williams, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, dismissed that argument. ''It's a commentary on our society that there appears to be unlimited demand for these kinds of services,'' he said. ''The institutions treat these illnesses efficiently and appropriately.'' **********With health care taking an increasing bite of the gross national product, ''at the current rate of increase, you could easily be talking 16 to 18 percent by the year 2000,'' Professor Reinhardt said. ''But I don't think we're going to do that.'' **********''In the next few years we will find out,'' he continued. ''Either the business community will be able to stand up and resist these price and utilization increases, or they will have to confess their impotence and join the Government'' in some kind of national health insurance system. A Plea to Bush **********The American Medical Association has called on President-elect Bush to appoint a commission, much like one that studied Social Security, to examine Medicare, said Dr. James S. Todd, a senior executive of the American Medical Association. **********''We are very much concerned that Washington and other payers will make their decisions on economic grounds - the worst basis on which to make health decisions,'' said Dr. Todd, who thinks that physicians should base their treatments strictly on medical considerations. **********The Federal Medicare program, which will spend more than $97 billion this year, is considering regional spending ceilings, among other long-range ideas. In each state, physicians, hospitals and other health-care providers would have to negotiate for a share of the available budget. **********''We may be getting to a point where we will negotiate a system of budget constraints,'' said Karen Davis, chairman of the department of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. She added that such a system would give physicians more flexibility than does the current system of rigid caps on payments for hospital care of specific conditions. Underestimates by Insurers **********Most health insurers seriously underestimated the amount by which costs would rise last year and suffered large losses. **********Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the nation had combined losses of $1.9 billion in 1987 and $950 million in the first half of 1988. ''Reserves are down to precarious levels,'' said Bernard S. Tresnowski, president of the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, the nation's largest private insurer. **********In an effort to control costs, private insurers like the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Blue Cross have set up discount arrangements with medical providers, prepaid health maintenance organizations and ''managed care'' programs in which medical claims are closely supervised. **********''So far, none of these approaches has solved the problem,'' said John D. Moynahan Jr., executive vice president of Metropolitan. ''The provider community continues to find ways to increase its revenues. Have you seen the TV ads for hemorrhoid surgery by laser?'' Mr. Moynahan said that Metropolitan would break even on health insurance this year. Employers Face Increases **********Insurers are now passing on their costs to employer health plans, which pay a major share of the nation's medical bills. Many employers have been hit with increases of 20 percent to 30 percent in health insurance premiums in recent weeks. **********''Major buyers of health care, like the automotive and telephone companies, are extremely unhappy,'' said Mr. Tresnowski of Blue Cross and Blue Shield. **********The General Motors Corporation spent $2.9 billion for employee health benefits last year. The Ford MotorCompany and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company are spending about $1 billion annually on employee health benefits. **********''The Government doesn't want to raise taxes, so it taxes indirectly by cutting Medicare, shifting hospital and physician costs to employers,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''In some cases, it affects a company's competitiveness.'' **********Many employers, in part hoping to cool off demand for medical services, have shifted an increasing share of health costs to their employees in the form of a larger deductible - the amount paid before insurance kicks in - and higher percentages of the doctor or hospital bill. **********But Dr. Todd of the American Medical Association said that disincentives have barely dented the demand, which he called ''practically infinite'' on the part of patients."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/27/world/soviet-interior-ministry-troops-get-more-power-to-quell-protesters.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 580, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Interior Ministry Troops Get More Power to Quell Protesters", "print_headline": "Soviet Interior Ministry Troops Get More Power to Quell Protesters", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has expanded the powers of its Interior Ministry troops, granting them broader authority to bear arms, suppress public demonstrations and enter private homes in pursuit of criminals. **********The decree was adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, on July 28, but has not been publicized or published in the central press.

''Multilateral lending institutions want to increase lending but they also insist on maintaining the quality of their loans to safeguard their market reputation,'' said Edward J. Waters, a managing director of Kidder, Peabody & Company, a leading brokerage house. **********Net lending - the amount of new loan money actually spent each year minus repayments on previous loans - in all developing countries by the World Bank plummeted from $3 billion in 1985 to $532 million in 1986 and to $398 million last year, according to bank calculations. If loan repayments from industrial countries such as Japan and Finland are included, then the World Bank had a net inflow of $350 million last year. Figures Called Deceptive **********World Bank officials argue that these figures are deceptive, however, because the bank's net lending in the world's 15 most heavily indebted countries is now on a strong upward curve. After falling from $1.2 billion in 1985 to $288 million the following year, it climbed to $805 million last year. **********''There is a strong, positive flow of funds to the countries that need our help most,'' said D. Joseph Wood, vice president for financial policy and risk management at the World Bank. **********Since 1985, the World Bank's sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, has been a substantial net importer of funds from the developing world. Last year the I.M.F. received about $8.6 billion more in loan repayments and interest charges than it lent out. In 1986, the net inflow was $5.5 billion. In 1985, the I.M.F. lent out $560 million more than it received in loan repayments. But the $3.1 billion it received in interest payments on outstanding loans that year kept it a net importer of capital from the third world. **********When combined, these figures show that the World Bank and I.M.F. perhaps made a small net financial contribution to the third world in 1985 but have been heavy importers of capital since then. **********William R. Cline of Washington's Institute for International Economics, an economic research organization, argued that ''new disbursements by the bank and fund should match reflows in today's world and ideally produce a resources transfer to developing countries.'' 'Hard to Change' **********Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution, also a research organization in Washington, said: ''The I.M.F. reflow is regrettable but hard to change. But as a public institution the World Bank should increase lending to counter the outflow.'' **********Some officials say the World Bank's low rate of loan disbursements reflects the general economic crisis in the third world, which has left governments short of local currency funds to invest in new projects. The World Bank pays only the foreign currency costs of a project. **********In addition, the World Bank is increasingly constrained by the tight limits it sets on its lending exposure in individual countries to preserve its triple A credit rating. ''The World Bank has to maintain its credit rating on markets to be able to borrow, but that restricts lending,'' said Dr. Ann Kruger, former chief economist at the World Bank and now Arts and Sciences Professor of Economics at Duke University. 'Politically Embarrassing' **********I.M.F. officials concede that the net inflows are ''politically embarrassing'' but see nothing wrong with them, arguing that such reflows result from the heavy loans the fund made to developing countries at the start of the decade when the debt crisis first emerged. They say that borrowing countries should be able to repay their loans without difficulty if they use the money wisely. **********Prof. Peter Kenen of Princeton University, an authority on the I.M.F., does not agree. He says that much of the reflow has come about because developing countries refused to put into effect the tough economic reforms the I.M.F. tried to impose as a condition for rolling over earlier loans and decided to repay instead. **********In its annual report issued earlier this month, the World Bank said that developing countries had suffered a net capital outflow of $85 billion since 1982 as a result of soaring debt charges, capital flight and the reluctance of private banks to continue lending to them. This outflow is contributing to the declining rates of economic growth and falling living standards that most developing countries are experiencing. During the previous five-year period, developing countries had a total capital inflow of $140 billion. **********Both the World Bank and the I.M.F. are now seeking to increase development money for the third world, canceling out at least part of the net reflow they are receiving. Rise in Capital Expected **********In the next few weeks the World Bank's member countries are expected to agree to increase the bank's $92 billion capital by about $70 billion. This would allow the bank to expand new lending from an expected $15 billion this year to more than $20 billion in the early 1990's. (The money it gets in loan repayments is used to repay the money it borrows.) But World Bank officials caution that even with higher levels of lending in the developing world, lending may still not greatly exceed loan repayments and interest charges. **********A major reason is that the World Bank is now emphasizing ''fast dispersing'' loans, which are running at about $3 billion a year. Such loans are paid out more quickly than regular loans, providing faster help for developing countries. But they also have to be repaid more quickly. **********As for the I.M.F., a number of steps are being taken to provide the developing world with more credit and thus offset the huge repayment flows it is receiving. **********In December, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, raised $8 billion from industrial nations and plans to lend it over 10 years at low interest to the world's poorest countries, provided they follow his economic advice. **********Known as the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, this new fund will enable the I.M.F. to replace the loans these countries are now repaying with longer-term and cheaper credits. **********In addition, the I.M.F. is trying to make its loans more attractive to the economically more healthy developing countries whose governments frequently balk at the economic conditions it attaches to them.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, would be willing to step down ''at an opportune time'' before presidential elections scheduled for May 1989. **********But Mr. Solis conditioned the offer on the political opposition's willingness to join in a ''national dialogue.'' **********Mr. Solis's remarks were the first public declaration since the Panamanian crisis erupted 10 months ago that General Noriega would be willing, under any circumstances, to relinquish his post. But opposition leaders immediately rejected any such arrangement, dismissing it as a ploy to buy time. **********''He has to go immediately, not eventually,'' said Aurelio Barria, one of the principal leaders of the National Civil Crusade, an opposition coalition of more than 200 business and community groups. ''He's just wasting everybody's time.'' No Specifics Are Mentioned **********In a speech broadcast on national television, Mr. Solis said General Noriega, ''pledging his word as a soldier and a man, has put his post at my disposition'' in order to guarantee the integrity of the presidential elections. No date or specific circumstances for General Noriega's resignation or retirement were mentioned, however. **********General Noriega's proposal, Mr. Solis said, was intended as a ''guarantee of good faith'' to the opposition, and his actual resignation depended on acceptance by ''all of the political forces of the nation.'' **********Immediately after the speech, General Noriega was asked by an Italian journalist whether he liked Mr. Solis's proposal. ''Yes,'' the general replied, ''because it is a Panamanian solution.'' **********But Mr. Barria said there can be ''no dialogue'' with General Noriega or Mr. Solis. ''How can they talk about the Constitution when they are an unconstitutional government?'' **********In his speech, Mr. Solis blamed Washington for Panama's economic paralysis, accusing the Reagan Administration of ''financial piracy'' and vowing to resist American pressures. **********''The Panamanian people, and only the Panamanian people, will decide their fate,'' he said. Promotions Announced **********Mr. Solis's remarks came hours after the Panama Defense Forces, which General Noriega commands, announced the promotion of 99 military officers. General Noriega launched a house-cleaning of the military following a coup attempt last Wednesday led by Police Chief Leonidas Macias. **********The promotions are the first in two years, and appear to be aimed at rewarding Noriega associates and assuring continued loyalty in the ranks. **********Earlier in the day, the Civil Crusade began an ''indefinite general strike'' aimed at paralyzing the economy and persuading General Noriega that he must go. The action shut stores and factories here, placing additional strains on an economy already in a shambles. **********Leaders of the crusade, which has been demanding that General Noriega step down since last June, said the strike was 95 percent effective. But buses, taxis and trucks continued to function, and electricity and telephone phone services appeared to be largely unaffected. **********''This is a final call to all forces in Panama,'' said Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a leader of the Civic Crusade, which brings together more than 200 business and civic groups. ''We are agreed that Panama cannot continue working or undertaking economic activities while the dictatorship endures. We will not resume business until Noriega goes.'' Threats Against Strikers **********Apparently in an attempt to keep the labor unrest from spreading, General Noriega's cash-starved Government announced today that any civil servant who goes on strike or takes part in a work slowdown is subject to dismissal. The measure applies to all state agencies and ministries declared of ''national interest'' and placed under military control last Thursday. **********Legal action in the United States, which seeks General Noriega's extradition on Federal drug trafficking and racketeering charges, froze Panamanian Government accounts in American banks last month, cutting off the flow of dollars to Panama, which has no other legal currency. The crisis deepened March 3, when the Government acknowledged that it could no longer meet its financial obligations and ordered all Panamanian banks to close. Since then, retirees and the 140,000 Government workers have been unable to collect their regular wages. **********This afternoon, the Social Security Administration announced that it was postponing March's second payment of retirement checks to the country's 60,000 pensioners from March 23 to March 28. It said the change was necessary because of ''multiple inconveniences'' in obtaining the money due them. **********The threat of dismissals appeared to be having little effect among workers already on strike because of the Government's inability to pay them. At the headquarters of the dock workers' union in Balboa, workers continued to refuse to load or unload cargo and spent the day in their union hall, playing dominoes or watching soap operas on television. **********''There's been no change in our position,'' said Humberto Villa, foreman of a ship repair crew. ''We want our salary, we want it in full, and we want it in cash. We're not going to accept any phony bonds or coupons from the Government.'' **********Some police officers were on the streets, though in numbers significantly smaller than during other recent times of tension. Diplomats and military experts said General Noriega no longer trusts the police, whose chief, Col. Leonidas Macias, led a coup attempt last Wednesday, and wants to keep them under close scrutiny."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-president-quits-post-at-mccann-promotion.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; President Quits Post At McCann Promotion", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; President Quits Post At McCann Promotion", "body_text": " **********Benjamin Colarossi, 57, has resigned as president of the McCann Promotion Group, a division of McCann-Erickson, and said he has another offer he will be able to announce soon. **********His more recent jobs include president of Cato Johnston/Y.&R., president of Ross Roy Colarossi, and positions at Creamer Colarossi and Ketchum, MacLeod & Grove."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/21/business/article-073688-no-title.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 480, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 073688 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 073688 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********In a deal that will create the nation's largest grocery store chain, Lucky Stores Inc. agreed today to accept a sweetened takeover bid from the American Stores Company for $65 a share, or $2.51 billion in cash. **********The deal, which must be approved by Lucky shareholders and Federal regulators, ends more than a year of takeover pressure on Lucky, which is based in Dublin, Calif. **********Lucky said it had ended its April 28 agreement to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the investment banking firm of Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.

The crimes that the investment bank is said to have acknowledged in its plea bargain indicate a belief that rules are there to be evaded or broken and that the pursuit of profit justifies even steps that will damage a client. **********In almost all the accusations to which sources inside Drexel say the firm will plead guilty, the common thread is of trades that were illegally concocted or concealed. The accusations show an investment bank with myriad interests, often conflicting, that were not disclosed to regulators, customers or the public. **********The six felony counts to which Drexel intends to plead guilty cover many but not all of the accusations made in a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. Drexel's settlement with the United States Attorney depends in part on its settling the S.E.C. charges. **********One case in which Drexel is said to be prepared to admit guilt involved a client, the C.O.M.B. Company, a discount mail-order retailer now known as the CVN Companies. Using Drexel as its underwriter, C.O.M.B. wanted to borrow money by selling bonds that could later be converted into common stock. In such cases, the company benefits if the stock price is higher when the bonds are sold, because that allows it to set a higher conversion price. A lower conversion price makes it easier for the underwriter to sell the bonds. **********Although the sources did not say exactly what charges involving C.O.M.B. were covered in the plea agreement, a previous indictment naming a Drexel employee said he illegally arranged trades aimed at holding down the stock price, making the deal more expensive for C.O.M.B. The claim, put forth by the Government in a suit that named a Drexel broker, Bruce Lee Newberg, as a defendant, is that Mr. Newberg, who has pleaded innocent, induced Princeton/Newport Partners, a Drexel client, to sell short 40,000 shares of C.O.M.B. stock in 1985 as the deal was being priced. The Government claims Princeton/Newport was just a front in the trade, with Drexel promising to indemnify it for any losses incurred. **********Short sales would be expected to hold down the price of the stock, and thus harm Drexel's client by forcing it to set a lower conversion price on the bonds it was issuing. **********In the months following the sale of the bonds, the C.O.M.B. stock price rose and the bonds were converted into common stock. Had the conversion price been set higher, as might have happened but for the actions charged by the Government, C.O.M.B. would have had to issue fewer shares. **********Another case involved an aborted attempt by Golden Nugget Inc., a casino company, to acquire MCA Inc., a major entertainment company. According to the S.E.C. charges, Michael R. Milken, the head of Drexel's junk bond operation, urged Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman of Golden Nugget, to undertake the acquisition. But Mr. Wynn, after his firm had acquired 4.95 percent of MCA's stock, decided not to proceed. **********Selling the stock would have been difficult had other traders known what was going on, and so Mr. Milken is said to have arranged for Ivan F. Boesky, then the most prominent and most feared takeover stock speculator on Wall Street, to buy several blocks of stock in a way that would be noticed, generating takeover speculation. Mr. Milken has denied any wrongdoing. **********After Golden Nugget sold some of its shares, the Government says, Mr. Wynn falsely told a reporter for The Wall Street Journal that his company still owned almost 5 percent of the stock. Mr. Wynn, who was not charged in the S.E.C. complaint, previously declined to comment on the accusations. His office said yesterday he was on vacation and could not be reached. **********By the Government account, the illegality in this occurred from the fact that Mr. Boesky was not the real purchaser of MCA stock, because Drexel had indemnified him against any losses, and brokerage records that showed he was the owner were false. The facts presented by the Government make it appear that Golden Nugget was able to sell its stock at a profit. **********Another deal in which Drexel is said to be willing to admit wrongdoing is Victor Posner's 1985 purchase of a controlling stake in the Fischbach Corporation. In this case, the S.E.C. has argued, Drexel arranged for Mr. Boesky to help Mr. Posner evade a ''standstill agreement'' he had signed in 1980 in which he promised not to buy more than 25 percent of the company. That agreement allowed Mr. Posner to increase his stake if another person acquired 10 percent or more. **********The S.E.C. charges state that Mr. Milken directed Mr. Boesky to buy enough shares in Fischbach to cancel the standstill agreement, promising him that Mr. Posner would buy those shares later and protect Mr. Boesky from any losses. Mr. Posner did later buy Mr. Boesky's stock at a price well above market value. **********Mr. Posner, who is a codefendant with Drexel in the S.E.C. civil case, bought a majority of the stock and has run the company since then. Fischbach closed yesterday at $17, about half the price at which it sold when Mr. Posner gained control. Mr. Posner has denied wrongdoing. **********Another charge, concerning the Stone Container Corporation, is that Drexel manipulated the price of a stock to enable a deal to go through. Stone was unwilling to go ahead with a convertible issue unless its common stock was trading above $46 per share. Cary Maultasch, an aide to Mr. Milken, is said to have told Mr. Boesky to buy Stone shares to force up the price. The effort succeeded, allowing Drexel to collect a $6 million underwriting fee. Mr. Boesky later sold his shares at a loss, which Drexel is said to have agreed to cover. **********Another charge where Drexel is said to be willing to enter a guilty plea demonstrates the web of relationships and interests that have often appeared in deals involving Mr. Milken. **********It involves Harris Graphics, a company in which Mr. Milken and other Drexel employees owned a stake. Mr. Milken is said to have worked tirelessly at trying to persuade a long list of clients to buy the company. Those efforts finally bore fruit when AM International Inc. bought the company for $22 a share in June 1986, more than three years after Mr. Milken and his associates purchased their shares for $1 each, making a profit of $25.8 million on an investment of $1.2 million. Drexel earned a $4 million fee for arranging financing of the takeover. **********As part of the campaign to attract interest in Harris by making it appear to be a takeover candidate, Mr. Milken is said to have directed Mr. Boesky to buy and then disclose a 5 percent stake in the company. In fact, the S.E.C. argued, Drexel guaranteed to absorb any losses by Mr. Boesky, and therefore was the owner of the shares. The violation of the law came in not disclosing that fact. **********In effect, that maneuver was a variant of ''parking,'' a Wall Street term for masking the true ownership of stock from regulators and the public. **********A different form of parking came into play with another accusation said to be involved in the plea bargain. The S.E.C. requires all brokerage firms to maintain adequate capital. In computing how much capital is needed, it applies risk factors to various assets, reflecting the possibility of a price drop. The accusation concerns Mr. Boesky's firm, the Seemala Corporation, which had suffered major losses when Carl C. Icahn, the corporate raider, abandoned his bid to acquire Phillips Petroleum. Drexel is said to have arranged for the apparent purchase of the Phillips shares from Seemala, making the firm appear to be in compliance with capital rules, although Seemala in fact retained the risk of further price declines. **********While some of the six charges are serious, by Wall Street ethical standards none are quite as outrageous as three accusations in the S.E.C. civil suit that are said to be excluded from the plea bargain. Two of those involve insider trading to take advantage of confidential information regarding possible takeovers that was said to have been given to Drexel. The other involved directing Mr. Boesky to buy shares in Pacific Lumber at a time when Maxxam Group Inc., a Drexel client, was seeking to acquire the company. The S.E.C. charges claimed those actions forced up the price of Pacific Lumber and led to Maxxam's having to pay more to acquire the company, raising Drexel's fee."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/01/business/us-warned-by-europe-on-farm-trade-stance.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1988-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Warned by Europe On Farm Trade Stance", "print_headline": "U.S. Warned by Europe On Farm Trade Stance", "body_text": " **********The European Community's top trade negotiator said today that the United States was taking an ''absolutely unacceptable'' position on long-term agricultural reform in advance of critical world trade talks in Montreal next week. **********Willy de Clercq, the community's Commissioner for External Trade, said that if Washington stuck to its position it would have only itself to blame for the failure of the talks, which are intended to define rules for international trade in the next decade and beyond. **********The bloc's trade chief, who responded to questions from five Washington reporters in a telephone interview from Brussels, raised the possibility of a major confrontation. **********He was responding in part to comments Tuesday by American negotiators who discussed the trade talks and their intention to stand firm.

But he said the United States would abstain because it thinks repeatedly raising the issue does not help the process of restoring order. **********He also noted that the four Palestinians deported to southern Lebanon had failed to exhaust all avenues open to them under Israeli law by refusing to appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court. **********The Security Council resolution today calls on Israel to rescind its deportation order and insure ''the safe and immediate return'' of the Palestinians it has already deported. **********It requests Israel to ''desist forthwith'' from deporting any more Palestinian civilians from the occupied territories and says the Council will continue to review the situation. American Decision Criticized **********The American abstention was criticized by Zehdi Labib Terzi, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's observer mission, who said it was not consistent with America's commitment to ''the norms of international law and justice.'' **********Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli delegate, called the resolution ''biased and unbalanced.'' He accused the Security Council of condoning Palestinian violence against Israel but condemning Israeli countermeasures. **********''Even if we threw rose petals at the Molotov cocktail throwers, this body would find a way to condemn us,'' Mr. Netanyahu said. Israel, he added, would never accept the resolution. **********As one of five permanent Security Council members, the United States has a right of veto over all decisions, along with Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China. The 10 rotating Council seats are currently held by West Germany, Italy, Japan, Zambia, Argentina, Algeria, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Nepal and Senegal. **********On Friday, the Security Council is to start a debate on a complaint by Lebanon about recent Israeli attacks in Southern Lebanon, which the Israelis say were reprisals against P.L.O. installations there. **********The United States has made clear it will veto such a resolution if it is put to a vote. But today Lebanon rejected a proposed compromise under which the Security Council president was to issue a statement on the matter, diplomats say, apparantly because it still wants a formal resolution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/30/business/malaysia-in-cocoa-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Malaysia in Cocoa Talks", "print_headline": "Malaysia in Cocoa Talks", "body_text": " **********Malaysia will consider joining the International Cocoa Organization after talks were held between a cocoa organization delegation and Malaysia's Minister of Primary Industries, Lim Keng Yaik, the organization said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/08/business/patents-swimming-pool-alarm.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1988-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Swimming Pool Alarm", "print_headline": "Patents; Swimming Pool Alarm", "body_text": " **********Samuel F.

Gorbachev and to any improvements he may make in human rights in the Soviet Union. **********Under an amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, substantial levels of Jewish emigration are necessary to grant Moscow the status of a most favored nation in trade, which would lower tariffs on Soviet products. By voice vote on May 13, the Senate passed a proposal, which is being resisted by the Administration, that would establish a broad human rights standard as an additional test for the lower tariffs Moscow wants to boost exports and to signify the status of equal trading partner. 'Vague and Nebulous' **********It would withhold improved trade status until there was ''substantial'' Soviet compliance with a human-rights agreement Moscow entered into at the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Helsinki in 1975. **********The proposal was an amendment to a military budget bill, which is in a conference to settle differences in the House and the Senate versions of the bill. The House version does not contain the human rights test, which was sponsored by Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho. But Congressional aides said there is broad support for it from both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in the House. **********''We understand the sentiments behind the McClure amendment,' said a senior Administration official. ''But we shouldn't be loading so vague and nebulous a cargo on board the economic relationship.'' **********A Senate aide called the amendment a ''shot across the bow'' to head off what many on Capitol Hill think may be a post-summit Administration effort to seek a waiver of the requirements on Jewish emigration sponsored in 1974 by Senator Henry M. Jackson and Representative Charles A. Vanik. Restrictions on Financing **********''A continuing, stable, bilateral relationship will, I believe, bring about conditions that will enable the President to consider a waiver under Jackson-Vanik,'' said Margaret Chapman, director of the trade program for the American Committee on United States -Soviet Relations, a private policy organization. **********The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies most-favored-nation status to Communist countries that do not permit free emigration. Such denial means that duties against nickel, phosphates, vodka, caviar, tractors and other Soviet exports to the United States are up to 10 times higher than duties against products from most other countries. The law also bars the Soviet Union from credits such as those from the Export-Import Bank. **********But the President may seek a temporary waiver of the restrictions if he receives assurances from the country that its policies would henceforth lead to ''substantially'' free emigration. More Jews Are Leaving **********Jewish emigration is up dramatically. Last year, 8,011 Jews received exit permits, against 900 in 1986. The outflow reached a seven-year monthly high in May, when 1,145 Jews were allowed to leave. So far this year, 4,547 Soviet Jews have arrived in Vienna, according to the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, a Geneva-based monitoring group. **********The Administration has never cited any emigration number as satisfying the waiver requirement, but Congressional experts suggest it should be at least 15,000 a year. Western experts have estimated that more than half a million Soviet Jews wish to leave. **********Senator McClure noted that the granting of most-favored-nation treatment would be ''sold as a temporary measure designed to encourage liberalization in the Soviet Union.'' **********But he added: ''We all know that once a stream of trade is established and contracts are signed, there is no force on Earth that can turn off the tap. If the Soviets want M.F.N. status, let them demonstrate their desire and their right to such status by complying with the Helsinki accord.'' **********Eighteen members of Congress and three representatives of the executive branch sit on a commission that monitors Soviet human rights progress. An official of this Helsinki Commission, who asked to remain anonmyous, said there was a consensus among members that substantial compliance would include the release of political prisoners, reduction of restraints on emigration, an end to the jamming of Western broadcasts and measures to reunify divided families. **********President Reagan, who in his meetings with Mr. Gorbachev and others in Moscow emphasized the importance the United States attaches to human rights, also spoke excitedly about trade prospects last week. **********''Nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between America and a growing, exuberant, exporting Soviet Union that had opened up to economic freedom and growth.'' **********While two-way trade between the two countries has grown substantially since the 1960's - from less than $250,000 in 1971 to close to $1.9 billion in 1987 - it has followed no steady course. **********''Political determinants are more important than economic ones in giving the trade relationship its erratic pattern,'' said Paul Stern, former chairman of the International Trade Commission and now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A Rare Surplus for the U.S.  Three-quarters of what the United States sells to the Soviets are agricultural products and most of what it buys are raw materials. The Soviet Union is one of the rare countries with whom the United States has a trade surplus. **********The Commerce Department estimates that favored trade status would increase Soviet exports to the United States, which last year totaled $470 million, by between $20 million and $100 million a year. **********''These are not large figures,'' said Franklin J. Vargo, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Europe. ''This is because the Soviets have not been able to generate exportable manufactured goods in large quantities.'' **********But he added that the Russians may be expecting larger benefits because of their recent interest in joint ventures with American companies. For example, Combustion Engineering Inc. announced last Wednesday that it had reached an agreement to help build and manage a multibillion-dollar petrochemical complex in Western Siberia. **********Other companies with either existing or contemplated joint ventures include Occidental Petroleum, RJR Nabisco Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Ford Motor Company, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Eastman Kodak and Chevron Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/16/world/nairobi-journal-a-little-engine-that-could-still-can.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1988-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 943, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Little Engine That Could Still Can", "print_headline": "NAIROBI JOURNAL; A Little Engine That Could Still Can", "body_text": " **********The puff-puff, chug-chug, whistle, soot and steam were the stuff of rapture. **********''This is the best thing you can see in life - the best,'' said Julius Mimano, smiling broadly. **********Mr. Mimano, managing director of Kenya's railway system, was aboard a train pulled by the Mount Shengena steam locomotive snaking its way along 70 miles of track from Nairobi to the town of Naivasha in the Great Rift Valley. **********Never mind that the trip took more than five hours in this age of jets, or that steam and black smoke temporarily filled the coaches - somebody forgot to close the windows when the train inched through a tunnel - and the eyes and throats of passengers. For train enthusiasts, this was something to write sonnets about. **********In honor of its first decade as an independent corporation, Kenya Railways released the 33-year-old steam locomotive from its shackles in the Nairobi Railway Museum. **********The decision to put the maroon locomotive, a 59 class Garratt, back in service was also in response to the pleadings of fans of steam trains from as far away as the United States and Australia. They were clamoring for the nostalgia, romance and soul satisfaction that, for them, only the smoking leviathans of yesteryear could provide. For Children of All Sizes **********Beginning in October, the railway corporation plans to operate the steam service two days a week for six months. If the response is good, railroad officials say, the service will become a permanent fixture. **********Another motivation for dusting off the locomotive, Mr. Mimano said, was to allow ''our children's children'' to have the opportunity to savor what for him and others is a divine obsession. **********Kenya ended its steam train operations in 1981 to make way for diesel and diesel-electric engines. The old steam machines had become too costly to operate, Mr. Mimano said, partly because some spare parts had to be made to order after overseas manufacturers of the engines stopped production, and partly because the locomotives consume up to 10 gallons of oil per mile to heat the boiler and produce steam. **********For the Mount Shengena to make it the 70 miles to Naivasha, its water tank, which holds 8,600 gallons, had to be replenished. While diesels can be in service 23 hours a day, officials said, time-consuming stops for water and fuel limit the run of steam locomotives to 16 hours. **********But what's a little oil and water among friends? 'Steam Is More Beautiful' **********''It is an honor to work this train,'' said Benjamin Muoki, 46 years old, the engine driver. He first drove a steam locomotive more than 20 years ago. ''Steam is more beautiful and I will be showing the young generation how steam works. I am thinking now of my young age when I was first driving steam. Things have changed since then. I now have a beard and little hair.'' **********The revived Mount Shengena rolled past higgledy-piggledy slums, carpets of lush farmland that seemed to touch the horizon, and the geographical spectacle of the valley's volcanoes, escarpments and lakes. Meanwhile, steam train buffs on board offered lyrical accounts of the ups and downs of East Africa's railway. **********Work on the nearly 600-mile-long Uganda Railway, stretching from the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa to Lake Victoria in Uganda, was begun in 1895. The undertaking was intended to end the slave trade, organize administrative and other services, construct roads and ease access to the hinterlands and such inland waters as the Nile and Lake Victoria. The idea was dismissed by much of the public in Britain, then the colonial power, as the foolishness of dreamers. **********Yet through hostile terrain and angry wild game, the dreamers persisted. Nairobi, then little more than a swamp, was reached in 1899 and became a railway construction camp. The railway reached Naivasha in 1900, but not without difficulty. Work had to be halted for three weeks because of menacing lions. **********Before the permanent track between the two towns could be completed, a makeshift ramp had to be built to move the trains temporarily from the top of the rift to its valley some 1,500 feet below. Passengers Get Out and Push **********Accidents were common. Trains laboring uphill often crashed into the rear of runaway cars speeding down the line. The trains, too, often ran out of fuel, including one time when Sir Frederick Jackson, Governor of Uganda, was a passenger. **********Sir Frederick and his entourage took machetes and axes to cut timber to fuel the engine. Even that wasn't quite enough to get the train over the top of the incline, so the passengers got out and pushed. The train made it over the hump. **********The railway reached the shores of Lake Victoria at the Kenyan town of Port Florence, now Kisumu, in 1901. In 1931, the railway reached Kampala, Uganda. **********For at least one person aboard the Mount Shengena, one of a group of the most powerful steam locomotives of their kind ever built, the trip provided less than poetic inspiration. **********''I've worked on all sorts of steam engines,'' said Francis Kamau, a fitter on the locomotive. ''The spare parts are very heavy to lift. Most of them need more than one person to lift them. Some people are very pleased that the train is running again. But for me, it's just a lot of heavy work.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/12/world/report-accuses-burma-of-torture-and-killings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 324, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Report Accuses Burma Of Torture and Killings", "print_headline": "Report Accuses Burma Of Torture and Killings", "body_text": " **********Army units in Burma have killed and tortured members of the country's ethnic minorities in gross defiance of Burmese and international law, according to an Amnesty International report published today. **********The report by the human rights group says that although many of the reported violations have taken place in areas where ethnic insurgencies have flourished for decades, ''none of the killings or torture by Government forces took place in the context of actual combat.''

Trump's deal to sell his controlling interest in Resorts International Inc. to Merv Griffin collapsed today, and the men immediately resumed their feud over the Atlantic City hotel-casino company. **********The proposed deal, announced last month after an often-bitter takeover fight, would have given Mr. Griffin, the former talk show host, control of the Resorts casino on the Boardwalk, as well as real estate and casino operations in the Bahamas. Mr. Trump, the New York developer, would have retained ownership of the lavish Taj Mahal casino being built by Resorts in Atlantic City. Financing in Question **********After a meeting in New York with executives of the Griffin Company, Mr. Trump said he had ended negotiations over the final agreement because Mr. Griffin could not prove he had financing in place and because of disputes over terms of the deal. **********Mr. Griffin's company immediately denied that financing was an issue and said Mr. Trump had refused to abide by the terms of the original deal. **********The Griffin Company said it intends to meet with the outside directors of Resorts in order to continue its acquisition efforts. **********Thomas Gallagher, a lawyer for the Griffin Company, which is based in Los Angeles, said the major sticking point was how much of the expense incurred so far to build the Taj Mahal would be assumed by Griffin. **********Mr. Gallagher said the original deal was based on financial statements dated Dec. 31, and that Griffin was to assume the liabilities associated with the Taj Mahal through that date. Mr. Trump subsequently demanded that Griffin assume liabilities through March 31, a difference of up to $40 million, Mr. Gallagher said. **********In addition, the two sides could not agree on who would own a valuable parking garage under construction. Mr. Trump said it belongs to the Taj Mahal, but Mr. Griffin's advisers said that internal Resorts documents show that 1,200 of the 2,000 parking spaces belong to Resorts. **********Mr. Gallagher valued the parking garage at $15 million or more. 'Classic Problem' **********''It was the classic problem of negotiating with Donald Trump,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''He wasn't happy with the deal agreed upon and he wanted to sweeten it for himself.'' **********Mr. Trump's advisers said it was Mr. Griffin's side that tried to change the terms. Mr. Griffin's advisers wanted ''such a total renegotiation at the 11th hour that it could have been motivated only by a change in their ability to finance, or a lack thereof,'' said Harvey Freeman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization. **********Under the terms of the proposed deal, Mr. Griffin would have paid $36 a share for the class A stock held by the public and the same amount for the 5.3 percent of the class B shares not owned by Mr. Trump. Mr. Griffin would also have paid Mr. Trump $135 a share for his class B shares, the same amount Mr. Trump paid for them several years ago. 88% Voting Control Mr. Trump's class B shares hold 88 percent of the voting control of Resorts. The total price for the stock transactions would have been slightly more than $300 million. Mr. Griffin would also have assumed about $650 million of Resorts' debt. **********Mr. Griffin was then to turn around and sell the Taj Mahal back to Mr. Trump for $230 million, more than $200 million less than Resorts has invested in the project. Mr. Griffin would also have bought out Mr. Trump's management contract with Resorts for $58 million. **********Many analysts had called the deal a good one for both sides, and some analysts continue to believe that agreement will eventually be reached between Mr. Griffin and Mr. Trump. **********''I think Donald Trump and Mr. Griffin will kiss and make up,'' said Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.

Their actions show what industry, large and small, can do to reduce the level of hazardous chemicals in the nation's air, water and soil. **********Earlier this year, the two companies took inventory of their toxic chemical emissions in order to prepare reports for the Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies on July 1 under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986. **********Monsanto found, to its surprise, that its 35 plants across the nation released a total of more than 374 million pounds of toxic substances last year. More than 20 million were emitted into the air of the communities surrounding Monsanto's facilities. The rest went into streams and bodies of water, underground injection wells, landfills and waste-treatment plants. **********Many, although not all, of the chemicals have been linked to cancer, neurological and reproductive disorders, and other chronic human health problems. When Monsanto's data on the release of these chemicals were collected in one place for the first time, company executives, especially those not directly involved in manufacturing or regulatory compliance, said they were taken aback by the amount of toxic substances they were discharging into the environment. **********Yale Materials had a similar experience on a smaller scale. The senior engineer at the company's plant in Lenoir, N.C., Garland Ross, looked over the list of chemicals for which reports are required and found 1,1,1-trichloroethane, a solvent the company had been using in large quantities to clean and degrease metal cylinders. Mr. Ross estimated that his plant was routinely emitting into the air about 2,000 pounds a year of the volatile toxic chemical. **********For both Monsanto and Yale, the questions raised by these findings were serious ones. Why are we releasing (and, in Yale's case, using) such large amounts of hazardous chemicals? How are they affecting our workers and the citizens at our fence-lines? What do we tell the public? **********Other manufacturing companies have been asking the same questions this year as they scramble to comply with the new right-to-know reporting requirements. For many companies, the most important question has been the last one: What do we tell the public? **********To their credit, Monsanto and Yale responded with much more than a pat on the back and a reassuring, ''There's nothing to worry about.'' Mr. Ross and his colleagues had been looking for a workable substitute for ''1,1,1,-Tri'' for some time, and earlier this year they began using a water-based rinse that cleans and degreases without toxic side effects. ''Next year,'' Mr. Ross told the E.P.A. in a letter, ''I hope we can report that Yale has no toxic chemicals to report.'' **********Similarly, in an announcement sent to employees and plant communities on June 30, Monsanto's chairman, Richard J. Mahoney, pledged his company to a 90 percent reduction in air emissions of hazardous chemicals, worldwide, by the end of 1992. ''For a number of years, we have had a campaign to reduce plant releases,'' Mr. Mahoney said. ''Good progress has been made, but it is clear that the process should be accelerated - and we intend to do so.'' **********For Monsanto and Yale, the answer to the question, ''What do we tell the public?'' was actually the answer to another, more important question: ''What are we going to do about these emissions?'' **********Achieving substantial reductions in the levels of toxic chemicals released into the environment was one of Congress's chief objectives in enacting the right-to-know law. Monsanto and Yale are among hundreds, if not thousands, of companies that are only now discovering the extent to which they are discharging potentially harmful substances - not only as a result of plant accidents, but during routine daily operations as well. As this information is gathered and reported to the E.P.A. and the states - and ultimately to the public through a computerized national data base and other means - pressure will mount on manufacturing facilities to lower their toxic chemical emissions. **********IN many cases, companies will find that doing so is good business as well as good community relations. The savings from controlling waste and improving process efficiencies often more than outweigh the costs. In Yale's case, Mr. Ross found that even though the new non-toxic cleaner/degreaser is somewhat less convenient to use than ''1,1,1,-Tri'' (it must be heated to clean effectively and takes longer to dry), the substitution has cut his plant's cylinder-cleaning costs by 46 percent. The new rinse can be diluted in water, while the solvent was used undiluted; and the switch also eliminates the growing cost of hazardous waste disposal. **********Many other techniques for curbing the use and release of toxic chemicals at the source are available to companies both large and small: process changes, recycling or reuse of toxic wastes, better containment of volatile chemicals and chemical dust. The E.P.A. is gathering these ''pollution prevention'' techniques into a national clearinghouse so they can be widely shared with interested companies. **********Toxic chemical releases do not always pose a risk to the public health; many chemicals may dissipate or be neutralized before humans, animals or sensitive ecosystems are exposed to them. ''However,'' as Mr. Mahoney's announcement points out, ''the public expects no less than a maximum effort to reduce emissions, nor should we.'' **********Mr. Mahoney, of course, is right. And the question now is whether America's manufacturers will seize the initiative to reduce their toxic emissions voluntarily - or wait for their workers, their communities, or their Government to prod them into action. Here's hoping many other companies follow the good example set by Monsanto and Yale."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/13/business/business-people-futures-aide-picked-for-sec-vacancy.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1988-09-13", "snippet": "LEAD: President Reagan is nominating Mary L.

Schapiro, the general counsel of the Futures Industry Association, to fill the vacancy on the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Before joining the association, Ms. Schapiro served for four years on the staff of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the regulatory body for the futures industry. **********Ms. Schapiro, 33 years old, joined the agency as an enforcement attorney in 1980 and served as the legal counsel and executive assistant to the former chairman of the commodities commission, Susan M. Phillips. **********The nomination of Ms. Schapiro, which was announced yesterday by the White House, was endorsed by David S. Ruder, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********''If her record is not strong in the securities area, it is strong in the futures area and there is a great deal of similarity between the regulatory environment between the two agencies,'' Mr. Ruder said. ''I will expect her to be a quick study in the securities area.'' **********Some lawmakers questioned the Administration's motivation in choosing Ms. Schapiro, with her ties to the futures industry. The S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. have been at odds over various regulatory proposals, including the S.E.C.'s attempt to take regulatory authority over stock index futures away from the C.F.T.C. **********''I am concerned that she may share the attitude of the futures industry generally towards market reform and that her appointment may be designed to frustrate meaningful efforts to reform our financial markets in the wake of the Oct. 19 crash,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. **********Senior Senate aides predicted that Ms. Schapiro would not be confirmed by the Senate during this session. There is little time left on the legislative calendar and, with President Reagan leaving office in January, Senate Democrats are reluctant to approve any of his appointees. **********This leaves open the possibility that Ms. Schapiro would become the first recess appointment in S.E.C. history. Even if she is confirmed, her term would end in June. **********In a telephone interview yesterday, Ms. Schapiro acknowledged that her nomination would be controversial. She refused to discuss her views on specific issues like program trading until she has had a chance to meet with members of the Senate Banking Committee. **********''I think it is unfortunate that there may be criticism that because I've worked in the future's industry that I'm not somehow going to be an independent thinker, and that's troubling to me,'' she said. ''Anybody I've ever worked with will tell you that I'm very independent.'' **********Ms. Schapiro received her undergraduate degree from Franklin and Marshall University in Lancaster, Pa. and her law degree from the National Law Center at George Washington University.

Sakharov spoke out today for his Government's new strivings and against its old and continuing repressions, using the auditorium, microphones and translating services of the Soviet Foreign Ministry for words that not long ago would have been cause for criminal action. **********''The fact that I find myself in this hall reflects a change in the situation in this country,'' said Dr. Sakharov, the 67-year-old physicist whose persistent defense of his countrymen's civil rights brought him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 and, starting in 1980, nearly seven years of internal exile at the hands of the security services. **********His first appeal today, as it has been many times in the last 18 months, was for dissenters still serving sentences. ''All prisoners of conscience should be immediately released from jail, labor camps, psychiatric hospitals and from their places of exile,'' he said to the crowd of Soviet and foreign journalists. **********His voice was mild and his expression thoughtful as he looked out from behind a cluster of microphones and called for the release of 20 Soviet citizens imprisoned under a statute prohibiting ''anti-Soviet slander'' - including one whose offense was speaking out against Dr. Sakharov's exile. **********No well-known names were on the list. A Striking Image **********Two days earlier, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, sat on the stage a few feet away, his words translated in the same fluid monotone over the same earphones to many of the same reporters present today. **********The image of Dr. Sakharov, long the symbol of Soviet dissent, speaking against Government policies over a Government microphone, was part of a natural progression in his odyssey from exile in Gorky to publication in the Soviet press to meeting Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin in January. Yet it was still breathtaking. **********Dr. Sakharov said one freedom was still being denied him - the freedom to travel outside the Soviet Union. ''Personally, I believe it's not a matter of my former access to secret information but a matter of confidence in me,'' he said. ''I expect the Government agencies to decide such issues.'' **********But he added: ''I feel like a free man, and I've always felt like that. I felt like that in Gorky.'' In that central Russian city, closed to foreigners, his internal exile was enforced without any trial or sentence. **********''My freedom for now, for the time being, is not limited by anything,'' he said. **********It was even more astounding to see his wife, Yelena G. Bonner - who was damned in Brezhnev-era gossip as the harridan who led a great scientist politically astray - jumping up to the microphones to administer a general tongue-lashing. **********The immediate cause of her ire was a question from a reporter as to whether Dr. Sakharov had agreed to some sort of self-censorship in return for his access to official outlets. ''That is a base question,'' she said. ''You are trying to suggest Sakharov has compromised. He has not. He remains what he always was.'' **********She also peppered her outburst to the 200 journalists with phrases like, ''You're calling all the time; I can't get any sleep,'' and ''I can't fit you all in our two-room apartment.'' **********But the irascible and protective Miss Bonner, whom the Soviet press once called an agent of both Israel and the Central Intelligence Agency, stayed largely in the background as Dr. Sakharov expressed his approval of President Reagan's meeting with Soviet dissidents and Mr. Gorbachev's negotiating stand on submarine-launched cruise missiles. **********On the meeting Monday with dissidents at Spaso House, the American Ambassador's residence, Dr. Sakharov said the fact that the initiative came from the President was a sign of his ''permanent interest in the human rights issue in the Soviet Union.'' **********The meeting and what the Soviet press called the President's ''sermonizing'' on human rights issues were widely criticized by official spokesman here and clearly irritated Mr. Gorbachev. A 'Crying Example' **********''Regrettably, the meeting, which was loyal and tactful on the part of all participants, was criticized by the Soviet press in very negative terms,'' Dr. Sakharov said. ''This is a crying example of the old methods being used.'' **********He also spoke out on a wide array of other issues, from the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan to nuclear power to the touchiest questions involving Soviet nationalities. As a result of two of these national questions, involving Armenians and Crimean Tatars, he sent a letter to Mr. Gorbachev that led to an official audience with the Soviet leader, he said. **********In that meeting, in March, he called for the return of the disputed autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, now part of the Azerbaijan Republic, to the Republic of Armenia, he said. In February, the issue brought hundreds of thousands of peaceful Armenians to the streets of their capital, Yerevan, and led to a massacre of Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. **********Dr. Sakharov said he had also appealed to Mr. Gorbachev to grant all Crimean Tatars - deported to Central Asia at Stalin's order in World War II - the right to return to their homeland on the Black Sea. **********He also went out of his way at the news conference to speak out for the rights of at least one million Eastern Rite Catholics in the Ukraine who practice their faith in secret since their church was forcibly disbanded by Stalin in 1946. **********The Ukrainian Catholic Church's illegal status is ''archaic,'' and the Russian Orthodox Church should call for its legalization, he said in remarks that came on the eve of the celebration of the millennium of Christianity in Russia and the Ukraine. Support for Gorbachev **********But he gave equal time to supporting the programs of Mr. Gorbachev, whom he said he viewed as ''a great statesman.'' Some of his statements dovetailed so closely with Mr. Gorbachev's own that they merited approving mention afterward by the Soviet press agency Tass. **********Tass noted Dr. Sakharov's appraisal of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan as an ''event of historic importance, which should be continued in any circumstances,'' regardless of whether the Islamic guerrillas continued their fight. **********Tass also mentioned Dr. Sakharov's characterization of Mr. Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or restructuring, as an ''historic inevitability'' that is now facing ''active, and sometimes passive, resistance.'' **********Throughout the 90-minute session, throughout the friendly questions and the hostile ones, Dr. Sakharov never appeared ruffled or hurried. He gave answers in the same measured cadences, whether it involved favoring nuclear power as an essential source of electricity or criticizing the proposed high taxes on the newly legal profit-making Soviet cooperatives. **********And when giving his own answer to the question whether officials had set conditions on his use of the hall, he said, smiling: ''I would not have come if there had been any. And they did not try to set any. They know me better than that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-dmb-b-office-wins-nbc-entertainment.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 258, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; D.M.B.&B.

About 21 were hospitalized. Explosion in Gas Chamber **********At a news conference here this evening, John Brading, an executive vice president with Occidental Petroleum, which owned the rig, said it appeared that the first of two explosions resulted from a leak in an underwater chamber where natural gas was compressed before entering a pipeline. **********At the top of the platform, a continuous flame burns off excess gas. Rescue workers said they saw bubbles of natural gas rising that caught fire once they reached the surface. **********Cecil Parkinson, Britain's Energy Secretary, said this afternoon in a speech at the House of Commons that 16 bodies had been recovered and that 150 other workers were still missing. Rescue workers said they had little hope that the 150 had survived. **********''It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' Roy Carey, a 45-year-old survivor, his eyes swollen and scorched, told a group of reporters from his hospital bed. ''There was no time to ask -it was over the side or nothing. I just dived - it may have been 60 feet.'' **********Government and industry officials said that about half the 230 workers aboard the platform, 120 miles offshore, were sleeping when it exploded shortly after dusk. **********''The living quarters were destroyed in the blast,'' Mr. Parkinson said. ''That's why it appears that there is a very substantial loss of life.'' **********Most of those who survived were working, and many of them slid down hoses or dove from the platform into the sea. Several survivors said they had to dodge huge flames in the water and often had to bob their heads underwater to cope with the extreme heat. **********Indeed, 24 hours after the explosion huge clouds of smoke were still billowing from the blackened wreckage. **********Mr. Brading, the Occidental Petroleum executive, said, ''Those who were lucky and able to escape were up and at work at the time and were able to jump straight into the sea and get into rescue vessels.'' Inquiry on Lifeboats Urged **********Mr. Brading called for an urgent inquiry into the disaster as he questioned why none of the lifeboats, with a capacity for 300 workers, had been used. **********At dawn, rescue efforts included 15 helicopters and 21 ships, including 6 vessels in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization task force that was performing maneuvers about 100 miles from the platform. The rescue team, which incuded members of the Royal Air Force, searched a 240 square-mile area around the 12-year-old rig. **********''When we went on late last night, we certainly could see the fire raging from 60 to 70 miles away and the flames at that time were, we'd estimate, 300 or 400 feet,'' Garfield Porter, a squadron leader with the Royal Air Force, told British television. ''It was really an inferno. It was a very confused picture, but certainly people were being picked out of the water, especially in the first hours.'' **********Speaking in the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, ''We all wish to express our deep sympathy with the people concerned, those who have been injured and the bereaved of the very, very many we seem to have lost.'' Elizabeth Expresses Sympathies **********In addition, Mr. Parkinson, the Energy Secretary, said he had been asked by Queen Elizabeth to express her ''heart-felt sympathies.'' **********Rescue team officials said one rescue boat that had rushed to the platform caught fire when the platform exploded a second time. Two of the three rescue workers on that boat are missing. **********Mr. Parkinson said the explosion appeared to have been so violent ''that the platform was effectively destroyed.'' **********The worst previous North Sea oil disaster occurred when the accommodations platform Alexander L. Kielland, which housed workers at the Ekofisk field in the Norwegian sector of the sea, capsized in a storm on March 27, 1980, killing 123 men. Death Toll Since 1968 Above 400 **********The Piper Alpha explosion has pushed the death toll from North Sea oil and gas accidents to above 400 since 1968. In 1984, an explosion on the Piper Alpha rig injured several workers, and the cause remains undetermined. **********The Piper Alpha explosion Wednesday night was the third North Sea explosion this week. Last Sunday, the British Petroleum Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands blew up, causing heavy damage but no casualties. On Tuesday, the Brent Alpha platform exploded, with no casualties. **********The explosion on Piper Alpha came four years after a smaller explosion in a gas processing module on the platform slightly injured four people. Limited oil production resumed within a few days of that accident but it took more than three months to resume full operations. **********Britain began drilling in the North Sea in the late 1960's, and its huge discoveries there provided a major economic lift in the 1970's and throughout this decade. **********John Garrett, the Labor Party's shadow minister on energy, said he was ''appalled'' by the disaster and called for an ''immediate inquiry.'' In addition, Roger Lyons, assistant general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, whose members were working on the platform, told reporters that ''in the interests of the 10,000 oil workers in the North Sea and their families,'' the Government should name an independent health and safety inspection team for the oil rigs. Second Blast Collapses Deck **********Several survivors said they ran out onto the deck as soon as they heard the first explosion. They said they were standing there when the second explosion came, causing the deck to collapse, and in a sense providing them with some protection as they fell into the sea. **********''I was just going to bed and there was a bang,'' said Dave Lambert, a 38-year-old survivor. ''They came in and said there was a fire, get out.'' **********He said there were flames at all four doors leaving the sleeping quarters. ''I thought I was dead,'' he said. ''I thought I had had it. All of a sudden the floor opened up - the deck just collapsed.'' Next thing he knew he had fallen some 60 feet into the water. **********The Piper Alpha platform, which had recreation rooms and a helicopter pad, had six huge steel legs tied to the sea floor. Most of its 649 feet in height was hidden by some 500 feet of water. Oil Carried by Pipeline **********A pipeline carried the oil the rig produced to a terminal in the Orkneys, Scotland.

Industries, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking to reverse a ruling made by the California Insurance Commissioner on Friday. The ruling, which prevents insurance companies in the state from being owned or controlled by government entities from outside California, was a major setback for B.A.T.'s $4.3 billion takeover bid. The decision was based on a 1957 government ownership statute that the lawsuit contends was ''misinterpreted.'' Link to New Inquiry **********The ruling also figures in the Philadelphia investigation. Several Wall Street traders estimated that improper transactions allowed some traders to make $3.4 million in questionable profits on a certain class of Farmers' options. **********The California ruling was issued about 7 P.M., Eastern standard time, on Friday. On Monday, shares of the Los Angeles-based insurer dropped $5.25, to $56.75, in over-the-counter trading. But under exchange rules, the expiring options in question, the June put options, had to be exercised by 5:30 P.M., well before the announcement. **********On Friday, Farmers' shares had closed at $62 each, which meant that those holding the June put options, which give the holder the right to sell Farmers stock at $60 a share, were holding worthless securities. But the call holders, who had the right to buy the stock at $60, were ''in the money,'' the exchange said. 'The Exact Opposite Happened' **********As a result, ''all of the calls should have been exercised and none of the puts,'' said Joseph P. Fenton, the head of the New York options department for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage. ''But the exact opposite happened.'' **********The Philadelphia exchange, which makes a market in Farmers' stock, said that 97 percent of the 10,000 June put options were exercised, and only 28 percent of June call options.

Berman, the general counsel for O'Connor & Associates in Chicago, the Philadelphia specialist in Farmers' options. He declined to say whether the exchange was investigating O'Connor's trades. ''We wouldn't have anything to do with knowing who exercised an option and who didn't,'' he said. **********Another options trader said that the suspected traders apparently either had advance knowledge of the California ruling, which would indicate an insider-trading violation, or somehow backdated the transactions, which are submitted upon expiration to the Options Clearing Corporation, a Chicago entity that clears trades for the five leading options exchanges. ''Either way, it's a violation,'' said the trader, who asked not to be identified. S.E.C.

Mr. Ortega, in a televised address Tuesday, said his Sandinista Government was not renouncing its ''socialist orientation.'' **********''We are obliged to be creative and take the economic steps necessary for survival in these difficult moments, when the fundamental task is the defense of revolutionary power,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''For geopolitical reasons, we have not taken profound steps like those taken in Cuba, where private property has been abolished.'' Contras Want Economic Changes **********Mr. Ortega announced that restrictions on prices and wages would be eased and that collective bargaining between employees and employers would now be permitted. He also devalued the cordoba from 12 to 80 per dollar, and said interest rates on bank loans would be increased. **********He set only general guidelines for the new policies, however, leaving Cabinet ministers and others to fix details. **********Economic questions have not figured in the continuing negotiations between the Government and contra leaders, but the contras say there can be no freedom in Nicaragua without fundamental economic changes. **********Mr. Ortega attributed the country's perilous economic condition to what he said was the ''unjust economic order'' in the world, as well as on hostility from ''the great hegemonic interests of imperialism and highly developed capitalism.'' He said military spending had made domestic progress impossible, and praised Sandinista labor and peasant federations for resisting wage demands from workers who show ''a lack of ideological and political consciousness.'' Price Rises Predicted **********Jaime Bengoechea, head of the Chamber of Industry, predicted that the measures would cause prices to shoot upward. But he said salaries would not increase commensurately because many areas of the economy remain controlled. **********''In a free-market economy, these measures would be correct,'' said Mr. Bengoechea, who runs a factory that makes pharmaceuticals.

The existing economic model, which is the cause of the problem, remains in effect.'' **********Although the Sandinista Government says it supports a ''mixed economy,'' there is little that would be recognized as private enterprise. Most farmers are told what to grow and must sell most of their crops to the Government at fixed prices. Factory owners operate under similar restrictions. **********Largely as a result of these policies, both agricultural and manufacturing production have plummeted. **********The measures Mr. Ortega decreed were apparently aimed at providing more room for private initiative.

Measures Are Called 'Timid' **********''The President railed against imperialist aggression, the C.I.A. and all the other imaginary enemies he blames for the national economic disaster, but he refuses to place blame on his own Government,'' said a commentary in the opposition newspaper La Prensa. It called the new measures ''incomplete and timid.'' **********''Another failure is certain,'' La Prensa predicted. **********The Sandinista newspaper Barricada, however, said the new economic policies were ''collective measures'' designed ''to define more clearly the rules of mixed economy.'' **********In an editorial, Barricada praised workers for having ''decisively supported the revolution's socialist project.'' **********Several anti-Sandinista politicians urged the Government to take further steps toward a market economy. **********''What the President announced this week does not mean that the Sandinistas have become disciples of Samuelson,'' said Luis Humberto Guzman, referring to Paul Samuelson, the American economist known for his advocacy of free-market economics.

Growing Uncertainty **********The increased uncertainty surrounding the Brazilian economy has alarmed the country's foreign creditors and prompted many local and foreign business executives to postpone investments. **********Which course Brazil chooses is expected to play a fundamental role in determining whether it can obtain the resources necessary to resume its economic growth and meet payments on its $121 billion foreign debt or whether its current recession will be prolonged into the 1990's. **********''The existing economic model no longer works,'' one senior Government official argued. ''We have to get the Government off the backs of businessmen. We have to stimulate exports and increase our competitiveness abroad. Brazil will only grow if it's part of the world economy.'' **********The search for a new development strategy here and elsewhere in Latin America has been prompted by the devastating economic repercussions of the region's six-year-old foreign debt crisis, with countries that had long lived off foreign credits suddenly forced to find new means to grow. Political Complications **********In the case of Brazil, which ended 21 years of military rule in 1985, this search has been complicated by the simultaneous debate over the country's political future, with both the Government and the Constitutional Assembly allowing economic decisions to be influenced more by political interests than business realities. **********For example, the Sarney Administration for a long time fed the mood of economic nationalism by refusing to deal with the International Monetary Fund, by suspending payments on Brazil's $72 billion debt to foreign banks and by defending a 1984 law that excluded foreign competition from much of the local computer industry. **********For its part, the Constitutional Assembly voted in April to limit exploration and exploitation of metals and minerals to companies controlled by Brazilians and to cancel contracts under which such foreign companies as Texaco Inc. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group were allowed to look for oil here. **********Some decisions were the result of a strange alliance of Brazilian industrialists, leftist ideologues and nationalist army officers. In other cases, such as the ruling that imposed a 12 percent ceiling on real interest rates, the Assembly simply ignored free-market principles and did what was politically popular. Sarney's New Policies **********Yet, as the Assembly has stretched into its 16th month of work on the new Constitution, Brazil's economy has gradually slumped into ever-deeper crisis, with investment at a halt, unemployment rising, inflation running at an annual rate of 600 percent and growth not expected to reach 2 percent this year. **********Finally, after the appointment of an apolitical technocrat, Mailson da Nobrega, as Finance Minister in late December, the Sarney Administration recognized the need for change. Since then, Brazil has resumed negotiations with its foreign creditors and agreed to work out an economic stabilization program with the I.M.F. **********New policies were also announced on the domestic front. The Government moved to cut the budget deficit by freezing the wages of civil servants for two months. And on May 19 it reduced its economic regulations and trade protection measures. **********''This marks the beginning of a new cycle,'' President Sarney said, apparently convinced that he had found a way out of the country's economic troubles. ''It marks the return of national and foreign investment as well as of the market economy and free competition to Brazil.'' The Assembly's Resistance **********Yet, barely 300 yards from the Presidential Palace where this package was unveiled, the Constitutional Assembly still appears intent on taking the economy in the opposite direction, perpetuating the old model of ''import substitution'' under which local industry has been shielded from foreign competition. **********Since the Assembly has sovereign powers, it is in theory more powerful than the executive branch. ''While the Soviet Union and China are opening up, the Assembly is trying to close down Brazil's economy,'' one influential conservative Congressman complained. **********Yet the Assembly can still temper its economic nationalism before the new Constitution is promulgated. Many business people think that pragmatism will still win out over ideology. ''If the Constitution is too radical,'' one industrialist remarked, ''it simply won't be applied.''  PRICES UP 124% IN BRAZIL **********RIO DE JANEIRO, May 30, (Reuters) - Prices have risen 124 percent in Brazil during the first five months of the year, according to the Government. **********Prices jumped 366 percent last year and Brazilian economists expect the inflation rate to reach 600 percent this year. **********Prices increased 17.8 percent in May, the Government said. That increase follows April's rise of 19.2 percent. **********Some economic analysts have said President Jose Sarney's Government appears unable to solve Brazil's inflation crisis. **********Mr. Sarney introduced a tough anti-inflationary package known as the Cruzado Plan in 1986 but the plan was not successful. **********Reacting to rising prices, Brazil's Central Bank last week issued a new, 5,000-cruzado bank note, worth about $31.

By automating and by changing the way the remaining workers do their jobs, Toshiba has reduced the plant's manufacturing costs by 20 percent. **********Nor is the Fukaya plant unusual. Hundreds of Japanese companies have overhauled themselves - and in the process chipped away at the classic system of depending on Japanese factories and a loyal band of domestic suppliers. This drastic restructuring helps explain why corporate profits are now rebounding even though most Japanese companies have not raised prices in the United States, a key market, by anywhere near the amount that the yen has appreciated. The yen's value has doubled against the dollar since early 1985. More Parts Imported **********One practice that has become widespread among Japanese manufacturers is the use of less expensive imported parts - mainly from Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan. The Bank of Japan estimates that parts imports increased by 40 percent between April 1986 and March 1987 and will have increased 20 percent more by the end of next month. **********In addition, companies have redesigned products and manufacturing processes. Methods have ranged from the dramatic to the penny-pinching. **********Hitachi Ltd. reduced the time it takes to assemble a video cassette recorder at one plant from 3 minutes to 1.7 minutes and cut the number of workers from 33 to 4 by using robots. **********The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company cracked down on expenses for office supplies by charging employees for them, and reduced such costs by 5 percent in three months. **********To be sure, an economic recovery in Japan has helped manufacturers. In addition, many companies, including the Toyota Motor Corporation, Hitachi and the Sharp Corporation, have established financial subsidiaries to make wiser foreign exchange deals and corporate investments. But most companies have increased profits by revamping manufacturing and sales approaches. **********Some corporations that had been making most of their profits from exports, like Canon Inc., have regained their profitability by focusing on domestic sales. Overseas Production Added **********A slew of companies have been expanding overseas manufacturing operations. For example, Kobe Steel Ltd. recently announced plans to build a $20 million computer disk plant in Hayward, Calif., and Fujitsu Ltd. intends to open an American semiconductor plant. Matsushita has been expanding its consumer electronics plants in Southeast Asia, and more than a dozen Japanese companies, including the Sony Corporation, the Sanyo Electric Company and Hitachi, now have operations in Mexico near the American border. **********Reflecting their improved circumstances, 323 major Japanese manufacturers will show a 51.4 percent gain in profits and a 5.8 percent increase in sales in the fiscal year ending next month, the Wako Research Institute of Economics, an affiliate of Wako Securities, predicted. **********To be sure, the big profit increases in the current fiscal year are from low bases. Corporate profits had tumbled as the yen strengthened from 263 yen to the dollar in early 1985 to its current level of about 130 yen to the dollar. **********Indeed, the 323 companies in the Wako study suffered a profit drop of nearly 30 percent and a sales decline of 9 percent in the previous fiscal year. By increasing the cost of labor and manufacturing and the prices of products in dollar terms, the strong yen reduced Japanese competitiveness. The Companies in Trouble **********Some Japanese exporters have been gravely weakened by the ''yen shock'' and will not see business recover for a long time, if ever, said Gideon Franklin, an analyst with the securities firm UBS-Phillips & Drew. These include machine-tool manufacturers like the Hitachi Seiki Company. Other companies, like the Oki Electric Industry Company, have masked their operating losses with profits from financial investments. **********Discussing the corporate restructurings, James C. Abegglen, a management consultant with much experience in Japan, said: ''They go through the valley of the shadow and take a hit on profits. If it all goes well, which is not guaranteed, they come out healthier. But not all of them do.'' **********Even with their restructuring, most Japanese companies still face tough competition. For one thing, they must contend with countries with even lower labor and production costs, like South Korea. Labor costs are now even higher in Japan than in the United States in dollar terms. How 2 Companies Have Changed **********Still, many Japanese companies appear to be coping remarkably well with what has been their biggest challenge since the oil shocks of the 1970's. A look at how two companies, the Nissan Motor Company and Toshiba, adapted to the strong yen illustrates what a number of companies did to cut production costs. **********At both companies, the rising yen compounded other problems. Nissan, long the No. 2 auto maker in Japan, had lost ground to Honda. It was plagued with management troubles, high costs and lackluster automobile designs. Toshiba was vilified and lost exports to the United States because its subsidiary, the Toshiba Machine Company, had sold machine tools to the Soviet Union that the United States charged made submarines quieter, a violation of restrictions on technology sales to Communist bloc countries. **********While Toshiba continues to struggle with political fallout, an extensive restructuring program begun even before the yen had grown significantly stronger has started to yield results. A 'Total Productivity' Program **********Yoshiaki Yamanaka, senior manager of Toshiba's productivity division, said that after two and a half years, the company's ''Total Productivity'' program had halved the inventory in consumer electronics and office-automation factories, cut delivery times by 40 percent and nearly doubled productivity. **********Changes in Japanese and overseas markets, rather than the strong yen alone, prompted the restructuring effort, but the results helped Toshiba cope with the rising yen. Mr. Franklin, the analyst, calculates that every one-yen decrease in the value of the dollar costs Toshiba between $3.8 million and $7.7 million in profits. **********The Total Productivity program and other cost-cutting measures saved an estimated $885 million from April to September 1987 - a time when foreign exchange losses from the rising yen totaled $208 million. Changes in the Factory **********Toshiba's video cassette recorder plant in Fukaya demonstrates how the company has extensively changed the way it makes its products. **********For instance, Mr. Yamanaka said Toshiba used to pile one to two hours' supply of parts near workers. The piles took up a great deal of room, and Mr. Yamanaka calculated that one second was lost every time a worker had to take a step to find a part. Now, with workers called marshals delivering parts directly to assembly line workers, only 30 minutes' worth of parts need to be piled up, and productivity has improved. **********Toshiba has also redesigned products to reduce the number of parts. For example, it cut out one-third of the parts of a popular computer printer. **********Toshiba is now trying to tackle distribution, the area that Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers here, thinks will be the true test of Japanese cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Yamanaka said that the typical Japanese distribution system, a network of mom-and-pop retail shops, was too cumbersome and that Toshiba was trying to reduce the number of products handled by these outlets. The Struggle at Nissan **********At Nissan, the strong yen hit so hard that the company reported its first operating loss since World War II in the six months between April and September 1986. The company is still struggling to adapt to changes in the yen, and the results are not yet certain. **********But stringent cost-cutting measures, a redesign of vehicles and stepped-up domestic marketing efforts enabled Nissan to return to profitability by March 1987. The company expects to report a profit of 50 billion yen ($385 million at current exchange rates) in the fiscal year that ends next month, a slight increase from last year's profit. **********That is especially impressive given that Nissan has raised its prices in the United States by an average of only about 25 percent since September 1985 - while the value of the yen has nearly doubled against the dollar. **********A Pulsar, which Nissan makes only in Japan, was priced at $8,349 in the fall of 1985. It now costs $11,649 - but would cost about $16,700 had its price kept apace with the yen's rise. A Sentra, which is made both in Japan and at Nissan's Tennessee plant, carried a base price of $5,499 in July 1985. It now costs $6,499 - but would cost about $11,000 had its price risen in tandem with the yen. **********Nissan had high costs compared with other auto makers, said Yukihito Eguchi, a company spokesman, and set about trying to reduce them when the yen began to rise. The changes Nissan implemented saved it about $2 billion between April 1986 and September 1987. During the same period, the company calculates, the strong yen cost it nearly $1.7 billion. **********The company connected its day and night shifts to save the extra utility costs of turning on and off electricity. In July and August, factory employees work on Saturdays and Sundays to take advantage of lower weekend utility rates. **********To pare payroll costs, Nissan cut executive salaries and reduced its employee ranks through attrition, early retirements and the establishment of new subsidiaries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/26/world/moscow-journal-having-western-cake-isn-t-the-same-as-eating-it.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moscow Journal; Having Western Cake Isn't the Same as Eating It", "print_headline": "Moscow Journal; Having Western Cake Isn't the Same as Eating It", "body_text": " **********The Astro Pizza truck was parked by the Moscow River this week, selling its genuine American pizza, when Anatoly Bogdanov, smartly dressed and feeling a bit hungry, walked up to the window and dropped his rubles on the counter.

A Flood of Exotic Delights **********Everything Western seems to be coming to Moscow these days. Press releases and posters fairly scream their arrival: American books to go on sale in Soviet Union! Sushi for Soviets! Baskin-Robbins in Russia! **********But Soviet citizens are finding that this influx of things Western is, for the most part, not meant for them at all. Moscow, it seems, serves as little more than a backdrop for this exchange among Westerners. **********''We hear all about these great Western things they are bringing here,'' said Mr. Bogdanov, sulking after his unsuccessful attempt to sample what was billed as the first American pizza in the Soviet Union. **********''But then it turns out that you have to buy these things with Western currency, meaning you have to be a Westerner to buy it. Great. Now we can actually see the things that we still can't have.'' Russians Feel Like Outsiders **********Soviet citizens have long struggled with local products of dubious quality and availability. Reliable, abundant consumer goods and foods were a dream of distant shores, brought to life through the tales of visiting foreigners, or the rare friend or relative who had made a trip abroad. **********But the opening of Soviet society under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has made Moscow more accessible to foreigners and foreign goods, a city ripe for promotional opportunities. **********But many of those opportunities are limited to those who can pay in valyuta, or foreign currency, making most Russians feel they are outsiders. 'They Can Look' **********A coming addition to the look-but-don't-touch list is a new American bookstore that is scheduled to open in Moscow on Sept. 1. **********Its sponsors say it will be the largest American bookstore ever opened in the Soviet Union, with more than 4,000 titles from 345 American book publishers. They also say that payment will be in hard currency only. **********Thus the only Russians who will be able to shop in the American store are likely to be buying for the libraries of schools or institutes that have access to hard currency. **********''At least now they can look at the books,'' said Tankred Golenpolsky, the Soviet director of bookfair exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. ''Before, even that was impossible.'' Not Even One Flavor **********Allowing merchants to sell their products occasionally for hard currency is an incentive to Western businesses, because the exchange rate of the ruble is set (and inflated) by the Soviet Government, not the international market, and thus Soviet money is virtually worthless outside the Soviet Union. **********But exporting hard currency from the Soviet Union is technically illegal. Companies involved in such ventures have to negotiate complex deals with the Soviet Government to allow them to recapture their hard currency profits. Often this is done by buying a Soviet commodity - a popular choice offered by the Soviets is pickles -and exporting it for sale or use abroad. **********But describing the difficulties of perestroika-era economics does little to satiate Russians like the young woman who ventured to the Rossiya Hotel this week to the newly opened Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlor, only to discover that the shop accepts only hard currency. **********''I don't want all 31 flavors.'' she said. ''But I guess I'm not even going to get one.'' No Cajun Dishes for the Masses **********Patrick Ferrante, who is managing Astro Pizza's mobile unit in Moscow, said he actually prefers the days they sell for rubles. ''I love seeing those long lines of Russians and they look at this stuff and take a bite and just smile,'' he said. ''But I'll tell you, it's really a heartbreaker when they come by on valyuta days and we have to turn them away.'' **********But with many of the Western enterprises there are no ruble days for Russians. When President Reagan -the most prominent Western import to Moscow yet - came here for the spring summit, so too did John Folse, a chef from Louisiana who, according to advertisements, was introducing Cajun-style cooking to Muscovites. **********The only Muscovites who got to taste his spicy specialties were those temporarily stationed here from foreign countries where currency rates are set by international markets, the same people with the correct money to eat at Sakura, the first and only Soviet sushi bar. The Most Galling Practice **********Some cooperative restaurants are licensed to accept payment in hard currency or by credit card, in addition to rubles. At such co-ops, Russians lament, it is nearly impossible for them to get a reservation. **********Perhaps most exasperating for Russians is the longtime practice of making scarce Soviet and imported goods available to foreigners for hard currency in special stores called ''beriozkas.'' **********''Children of the Arbat,'' Anatoly Rybakov's popular historical novel about the Stalin era, is sold out in local bookstores and the waiting list at libraries here is three years' long. But at the book beriozka on Kropotkinskaya Street, the novel is almost always available - for hard currency only. **********''Isn't that just typical,'' said Aleksandr Petrov, a student shopping at Dom Knigi, a large bookstore in downtown Moscow. ''The Westerners get their own goods, and ours too. And we? We get to hear about it all.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/05/business/executive-changes-126588.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., Cumberland, Md., a division of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., said it has elected Louis S.

There is a widespread belief among economists that the increases will largely neutralize the reductions in personal income taxes that go into effect in 1990. **********The income tax cuts, intended to stimulate consumer demand, were drawn up in response to demands -notably from the United States - that Bonn try to stimulate its economy. The United States hopes that more German spending will lead to more purchases of American exports. **********The planned income tax cuts total about 19 billion marks (about $10 billion). The proposed tax rises will total about 8 billion marks ($4.4 billion), according to Otto Schlecht, State Secretary at the Economics Ministry. A New Tax on Gas **********The proposals include a new tax on natural gas and higher taxes on gasoline, heating oil, tobacco and property insurance. **********The natural gas proposal comes despite an understanding among members of the European Community that new taxes would not be initiated as part of a harmonization of tax codes within the community by 1992. **********The 1989 budget, presented today at the last Cabinet meeting before the summer holidays by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg proposes a 4.6 percent increase in federal spending, almost twice as much as originally planned, to 288 billion marks The record deficit of more than 39 billion marks ($21 billion) this year also necessitated the approval today of a supplementary 1988 budget. Behind the spiraling budget deficit are increased payments to the European Community, sharply reduced profits passed on by the central bank, the Bundesbank, and a rise in payments for unemployment. **********The high deficit is a severe setback for Mr. Stoltenberg, who came to office in 1982 with a pledge to reduce deficits through tight monetary and fiscal policies. The deficit has also seriously undermined any hope he may have had of being a likely successor to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'Mr. Debt Mountain' **********For 1989, Mr. Stoltenberg, who has been dubbed ''Mr. Debt Mountain'' by his opponents, plans a federal budget deficit of 32 billion marks ($17.6 billion). Federal payments of 2.5 billion marks ($1.4 billion) to the poorer North German states and additional contributions for jobless benefits were largely responsible for the larger spending program, Mr. Stoltenberg said at a news conference. **********Increased subsidies to steel mills to allow them to buy expensive West German coking coal, and to Airbus Industrie, the airplane manufacturer owned by West Germany, Britain, France and Spain, were the main factors behind a 20 percent rise in the Economic Ministry's budget for 1989. **********Mr. Stoltenberg defended the tax decisions in a television interview: ''If we want to see through the tax reform with a drastic cut in direct taxation,'' he said, ''then we must to a certain extent raise indirect taxes,'' by which he meant the proposed tax increases on such items as gasoline and tobacco. **********As the Cabinet was approving Mr Stoltenberg's budget proposals today, the tax increases came under fresh criticism. **********Franz Stadler, chairman of the German Automobile Club, appealed to Chancellor Kohl to reject ''this snatching of money from motorists.''

''We think we've made tremendous strides on quality.'' Labor Peace **********Whatever else it does, Ford's campaign highlights a much-improved atmosphere between labor and management at the No. 2 auto maker. A direct appeal by management for employees to do better work would have been impossible before the three-year labor pact between Ford and the United Automobile Workers union, said Joseph Reilly, who belongs to the 10-member Ford-U.A.W. quality committee established by the contract. **********''Quality wasn't an issue for us because we weren't asked to participate,'' Mr. Reilly, a U.A.W. member, said, referring to the hourly workers.

Gorbachev does all sorts of things that the leader of an inherently expansionist Soviet Union was never supposed to do. **********For starters, Mr. Gorbachev accepted an offer that the theory class believed was fashioned to be refused, the so-called zero option to abolish medium-range nuclear weapons. The zero option was largely the handiwork of Richard N. Perle, a hard-line Pentagon alumnus and a member of the trans-Atlantic elite. **********Mr. Gorbachev has continued wrecking conceptual models with his ''new thinking,'' permitting American verification experts to poke around his nation and announcing that he intends to reduce Soviet military forces by 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks.

Could jobs be threatened? **********Happily for them, and hardly surprisingly, the thinkers of the strategic circuit have decided that the answer is no. But after a fright, they have resolved that their industry needs some intellectual restructuring to avoid Gorbachev-induced obsolescence. Swords and Plowshares **********''There is retooling,'' said Richard R. Burt, the American Ambassador to Bonn, a roaming plenipotentiary to the elite's many seminars.

Vigilance is the watchword; swords are not yet plowshares. **********''The strategic affairs community has been focusing on the problem of an expansionist Soviet Union for 40 years,'' the American envoy continued. ''But this guy might not make it. What are the implications of a crumbling empire - could it become a desperate Soviet Union?'' **********West Germany has the highest per-capita density of strategic thinkers in Western Europe, including a raft of ''peace researchers'' who regard the Soviet Union as a benign and frightened superpower.

Civilians have tended to dominate the highly abstract and paradoxical ruminations on nuclear weapons -weapons that, if fired, would mean the bankruptcy of the theory behind them.

Is the fading of superpower rivalry opening a fascinating era (and unmined topic) of superpower cooperation in damping conflicts elsewhere in the world? **********''No, no, no - unemployment is not around the corner,'' insisted Francois Heisbourg, the Frenchman who is now director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ''I can tell you it's going to be a lot more fun than going over and over again the same arguments about the window of vulnerability, first-strike capacity and the 24 notches of nuclear deterrence.'' **********In Bonn, Karl Kaiser, the head of the Research Institute of the German Foreign Policy Society, said Mr. Gorbachev had forced a concentration on the nitty-gritty of societies in upheaval.

Under the President's executive order, American residents and corporations are required to violate Panamanian law.

Peter Maneri, said his company ''will comply fully.'' **********''We understand the intentions of the order, but we haven't had discussions with the Government about the specifics and we haven't seen the documents,'' Mr. Maneri said. **********A subsidiary, Texaco Overseas Holdings Inc., operates the only crude-oil refinery in Panama, with 300 employees, as well as two fueling terminals. **********The fees that Texaco normally pays to the Panamanian Government come in the forms of income, excise and sales taxes, Mr. Maneri said. He said he did not know the amounts. **********A spokeswoman for Eastern Airlines, Karen Ceremsak, said, ''we will be in compliance with the President's order.'' **********She said Eastern pays monthly landing, airport and navigational-assistance fees, which last month totaled $179,000. The next payments will be due the end of this month. In the meantime, she said, Eastern is maintaining its regular flights in and out of the country. **********The Western Hemisphere corporate spokesman for Chase Manhattan Bank, Kevin Corrigan, said that ''Chase intends to comply.''

The dispute is not over whether the existing voluntary quota system, which is scheduled to expire in September 1989, should be retained - everyone agrees that it should. Rather, the disagreement is over the restrictions on imports of semifinished steel. The limits have resulted in a shortage that is hurting the smaller companies. **********In 1984, the Federal Government persuaded 29 steel-producing nations to limit exports to the United States. The agreements were intended to hold the level of imported finished steel to 20 percent of domestic consumption. The quotas also sought to limit imports of semifinished steel, mainly slab, to 1.7 million tons a year. **********Although the next Administration will decide whether to extend the agreements, industry officials who are attending the meeting of the American Iron and Steel Institute insist that they must immediately begin their effort to win support in Congress. Industry executives met with Congressional leaders on Tuesday night. Lobbying Campaign Begins **********As expected, the large integrated steelmakers, which are significant producers of semifinished steel, formally began their campaign today to persuade the Government to extend the existing quotas, including those for semifinished steel. **********Also as no surprise, the smaller companies that have to buy their semifinished steel said the quotas on such steel were unnecessary and were hurting them. Leaders of these companies complained that the import limits on the semifinished steel from which they make their products had so tightened supplies that delivery times in some cases have tripled and prices for some products have surged in the last year. **********Warning that these higher costs have been causing smaller steelmakers, in turn, to raise their prices, James E. Chenault Jr., vice chairman of the Dallas-based Lone Star Technologies, said: ''There is a chance of a modest impact on inflation. The price increases of semifinished steel, both domestic and foreign, will gradually find their way through the economy.'' Lone Star makes pipe used by the oil and gas industry. Mr. Chenault said his company's costs for semifinished steel had jumped 15 to 20 percent in the last year. He said restrictions on semifinished steel should be eliminated ''when the domestic industry cannot provide adequate supply, and we're in that kind of period now.'' **********For their part, executives of large steel companies contend that the restrictions on imports, including those on semifinished steel, are necessary to keep American producers competitive with foreign steel companies, some of whom receive government subsidies. **********At a news conference, Thomas C. Graham, president of the steelmaking division of the USX Corporation and chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute, made it clear which group dominates the industry trade association when he reiterated its intention to seek an extension of the agreements. When asked if the association planned to pursue any changes in provisions for imports of semifinished steel, he said, ''No, we're not pressing for that.'' Materials Cost Is Rising **********''The impact of the steel quotas for semifinished products is far more helpful to the big, integrated producers,'' said an executive of a smaller steel company, who asked not to be identified. ''For us, this does nothing but make our cost of materials go up. If the quotas on semifinished steel were eliminated, it would bring our costs more in line with reality.'' **********Lone Star and several other smaller producers have sought the Commerce Department's permission to buy foreign slab. While they have obtained some relief, they complained that their needs far exceeded the amount they were allowed to buy. **********''We got only a fourth of what we wanted,'' said W. R. Wilson, chairman and chief executive of Lukens Inc., a steel producer based in Coatesville, Pa. Mr. Wilson said the restrictions on semifinished steel had placed ''a lot of pressure'' on his company. However, he stopped short of calling for an end to the quotas on those imports, saying that too drastic a change in the measures ''might jeopardize the whole voluntary restraint agreement program.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/business/us-seeks-meat-import-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Seeks Meat-Import Cuts", "print_headline": "U.S. Seeks Meat-Import Cuts", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration has asked Australia and New Zealand to cut back on meat exports to the United States, an Australian diplomat said today. **********The official, Timothy Mackey, agricultural counselor at the Australian Embassy, said Agriculture Department officials told him on Friday that foreign suppliers would have to voluntarily restrain meat exports before the end of the year or risk activating an import quota. **********Under United States law, a quota on imports of beef, mutton and goat is brought into force if annual purchases from foreign sources are estimated to exceed 1.5 billion pounds, Mr. Mackey said. **********He added that United States officials told him that, if imports continued at their current rate, an official estimate of 1988 imports due on Oct. 1 would exceed the quota.

The New York Yankee clubhouse has more of a consensus than Wall Street's analysts. **********''I would qualify as extremely bullish, not just as a bull,'' said Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. ''I think we have a very good chance to test the old high, 2,700, on the Dow.'' **********''I'm an unrepentant bear,'' said Justin Mamis, the strategist for Cowan & Company. ''Take profits everywhere, and move to the sidelines.'' **********The Street, of course, has always been a cauldron of divergent opinions. That's good business: diversity breeds sales. **********But diversity is one thing. Total confusion is another. Rarely have investment experts been as divided about the future as they are now: Depending on who one listens to, Wall Street is either in the midst of raging bull market - or an erosive bear market. The Dow is heading to 3,000, or maybe 1,300. That kind of diversity of opinion is what puts most investors into Treasury bills. **********The villain is the Oct. 19 crash. That brutal shock and its volatile aftermath have shaken Wall Street from its moorings. Some analysts say that October was a seminal event, much like 1929, and that the bear will roam Wall Street for years. The more extreme in this group suggest that investors put their money under their mattresses. **********But other analysts consider the October move a ''correction'' - shocking, to be sure - but a normal, inevitable, pullback that got out of hand because of program trading and portfolio insurance. These analysts believe that there was never any bear market, or if there was one, Wall Street has already passed through it. **********While there has been criticism that some market analysts are pushing stocks at the same time that their own portfolios are hedged, it would be hard to accuse either Mr. Bhirud or Mr. Mamis of stock shilling. **********Mr. Mamis's ''when in doubt, vote for cash,'' opinion stands on its own. And Mr. Bhirud has been a consistent bull. He joined Oppenheimer just days before the October crash, and believes now, as he did then, that the Dow Jones industrial average is eventually headed toward 3,000. **********It sometimes seems as if they are talking about different stock markets. **********''Every time there has been a big panic-type of selloff,'' Mr. Mamis said, ''it has been followed by a bear market rally that has been followed by a second bear market of the erosive type, a la 1930, and 1973-1974. Those are the two best examples,'' he said. **********Mr. Mamis also said that all the warning signs that were in place just before the October smashup are in place now. ''We have a weak utility average, a weak bond market, enormous speculation in the over-the-counter tertiary technology stocks, huge new offerings, an overvaluation of price-to-dividend ratio and an enormous increase in bullishness,'' he said. **********He concludes, basically, that the stock market is headed down, perhaps for a year or more, notwithstanding what he terms the Dow's current ''deceptive creep upward.'' **********Mr. Bhirud doesn't think so. ''Black Monday itself was an accident, caused primarily by portfolio insurance and by indexed mutual funds that swapped out of stocks and bought futures,'' he said. Its potential damage to the economy, he said, was limited by the fact that small investors were not in stocks. ''It did not have the negative effect that people thought that it should because many people were not hurt by that accident.'' **********And because ''portfolio insurance is basically dying of natural causes, and program trading is also basically slowing down,'' Mr. Bhirud does not see another crash on the horizon. **********''A 40 percent decline in stock prices normally discounts not one recession, but more than one recession,'' he said. ''And since I don't see a recession, I'm telling my clients not to sell out at these low prices. In fact, I'm telling them to start buying.'' **********For his part, Mr. Mamis could care less why the stock market collapsed. ''All the crashes are the same,'' he commented. ''It doesn't make any difference what caused the selling. A technician is not concerned with why, but with what happened.'' **********As a technician, Mr. Mamis charts stock prices, support and resistance levels, and draws historical parallels among market cycles. Economic news, good, bad or indifferent, plays little part in technical analysis. Mr. Bhirud, a fundamental analyst, is more interested in the economy, the dollar and various macroeconomic interrelationships. **********But this does not necessarily explain the difference of opinion. There are fundamental analysts who disagree with Mr. Bhirud, and technical analysts who draw conclusions that are the exact opposite of Mr. Mamis's. **********For example, Gene Jay Seagle, the head of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said: ''If this is the bull market that I think it is, we should eventually see all-time new highs, which would mean taking us above 2,722.''

Even without that additional expense, however, the United Nations expects to run out of money by October. **********''It's a major concern at the moment - peacekeeping operations are expanding greatly and at the same time we're not provided with dues owed to the organization,'' said the spokesman for the United Nations, Francois Giuliani. **********The warning was issued as Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran arrived here for negotiations with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq on ending the eight-year-old war. Two Ministers to Meet Wednesday **********In talks with United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar scheduled to start Wednesday, the two Foreign Ministers are to discuss the terms for an immediate ceasefire and steps to implement the rest of the United Nation's 10-point peace plan for the region contained in Security Council Resolution 598, diplomats say. **********The two Ministers first plan to meet separately with the Secretary General, who will act as intermediary between them. No time limit has been set for their talks. But the United States Representative at the United Nations, Vernon A. Walters, has predicted that a ceasefire could be in place within 10 days. **********Against that backdrop, United Nations officials issued their warning that a shortage of money would make it difficult for the world body to supervise a truce between Iran and Iraq and to monitor the rest of the Security Council's plan for a long-term settlement in the area. **********The United States, which would normally pay a quarter of the total cost of a peacekeeping operation, currently owes the United Nations $466.8 million, or about two thirds of all unpaid dues, as its contribution to the regular budget, as well as another $65 million for past peacekeeping operations, which the United States supported politically. More Peacekeeping Missions Seen **********If the Iranian and Iraqi Foreign Ministers agree a peace plan, the United Nations wants to send a peacekeeping force of about 250 soldiers to the region to monitor the truce, oversee the withdrawal of forces from occupied territory and help with the repatriation of prisoners of war. **********A United Nations team of military experts led by General Martin Vadset, a Norwegian officer commanding a truce monitoring force in the Middle East, is currently visiting Iran and Iraq to make preparations for such a new peacekeeping operation. **********Officials and diplomats here say that such a Gulf peacekeeping force could be only one of several the United Nations may need to send to other trouble spots around the world in the coming months. Current efforts to end the conflict in Western Sahara call for United Nations observers to oversee a referendum on the future of that area. The United Nations also plans to dispatch a large peacekeeping force to Namibia if South Africa agrees to withdraw as part of a settlement to the civil war in neighbouring Angola and the removal of Cuban forces fighting there. **********An agreement by Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Cambodia and a settlement to that country's complex political problems might also involve a United Nations peacekeeping presence, diplomats say. U.N. Reserves Not Replenished **********Normally the immediate, start-up expenses of a Gulf peacekeeping operation would be met from an emergency provision in the United Nations budget that allows the Secretary General to spend up to $10 million from the organization's reserves on such unforseen developments, officials say. **********But more than $8 million of that authorization has already been used so far this year to pay for the United Nations force monitoring the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan and other emergencies. **********Moreover, the failure of the United States to pay its budget dues has prevented the the United Nations from replenishing those reserves, so that any additional peacekeeping expenditures would have to come straight out of the regular budget, officials say. This would simply advance the time when the world body runs out of money, currently estimated at around mid-October."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/07/world/the-gorbachev-visit-and-in-london-an-abbey-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1988-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 326, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Gorbachev Visit; And in London, an Abbey Visit?", "print_headline": "The Gorbachev Visit; And in London, an Abbey Visit?", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

But bill rates, after posting moderate gains early in the day, closed slightly lower. **********Dealers were divided over the effect on bill rates of a move by the Federal Reserve to add reserves to the banking system indirectly. **********Late in the day, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills dipped by a basis point, to 6.44 percent; the six-month bills eased two basis points, at 6.84 percent, and the one-year bills were off three basis points, to 7.13 percent. **********After lunch, when most dealers had left for the Memorial Day weekend, the Treasury said it would auction $8.75 billion of one-year bills next Thursday in the usual units of $10,000.  Cash Management Bills **********The Treasury also indicated that it was temporarily short of cash by announcing an auction on Wednesday of $4 billion of nine-day cash management bills. These bills are auctioned to financial institutions in units of $1 million. **********Once again the Fed's action lent credence to the growing belief that it favored using its control over short-term interest rates to tighten credit, rather than raise the discount rate from its current level of 6 percent. **********This view was reinforced after the Fed indirectly added a modest $1 billion of reserves to the banking system yesterday, rather than a more generous amount to alleviate the usual heavy demands for credit over a long holiday weekend. **********Still, the central bank's action helped shave the bedrock Federal funds rate to 7 3/8 percent. Before the Fed's move, funds were trading just above 7 1/2 percent. The Federal funds rate, which is what banks and other financial institutions charge each other for temporary loans, is considered the bedrock lending charge from which most other interest rates are scaled upward. **********But there were few price changes among Treasury notes and bonds yesterday. The benchmark long Treasury notes, the 9 percent issue of 1998, were offered late in the session at 98 19/32, up 1/32 on the day, and now yield roughly 9.21 percent, the same as a week ago. **********The Treasury's bellwether long bond, the 9 1/8 percent issue of 2018, was marked up 3/32 on the day, at 98 2/32, for a yield of 9.31 percent, compared with 9.34 percent a week earlier. **********''The Fed believes the recent rise in exports and the high level of consumer spending could fuel a resurgence of inflation,'' said Dana B.

''Historically, when the funds rate exceeds the discount rate by so wide a margin as it does today, 150 basis points, critics of the Fed will complain that it is subsidizing the banking industry,'' he said. ''But should the Fed raise the discount rate it charges banks, it would cause a general increase in interest rates.

Supplies were shut off for about four weeks, Mr. Loch said. How long it will be this time, he said, is unclear. **********Industries and institutions that are affected include hospitals, hotels, breweries, universities, oil refineries and electric utilities, Mr. Loch said. Operations should not be disrupted, he said, because those affected are equipped to burn other fuels. Chevron Refinery Affected **********Chevron USA's refinery, which supplies gasoline and jet fuel to the Los Angeles region, will be among those cut off, Thomas R. Richart, a Chevron spokesman, said. ''We will make arrangements to compensate,'' he said. **********Of the utility's 4.2 million customers, about 214,000 are nonresidential users, but only 38 percent of the industrial customers are equipped to use nongas fuels. **********The switch should reduce the daily consumption of four billion cubic feet of gas by about 10 percent, the utility said. Supplies in the open market are so short that the utility is tapping its underground reserves to meet 25 percent of present demand. In December 1986 gas consumption was only two billion cubic feet daily. **********Utilities in Eastern states traditionally supply industrial customers only nine months of the year, Mr. Loch said. In the milder West, however, gas companies rarely cut off industrial customers to protect supplies for residences, he said. **********''Right now, demand is so heavy that it strains our capacity,'' Mr. Loch said. Gas utilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Nevada are taking similar steps to curtail industrial supplies, he said. Commission's Ruling Involved **********Spot prices have risen from $1.70 a million British thermal units in midsummer to about $2 a million now. **********The price dispute involves the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ruling last August over complex ''take or pay'' rules, which oblige natural gas pipeline companies to pay producers for high-priced gas even if they cannot sell it. Such contracts become a burden when gas prices tumble. **********The ruling, upheld by a United States Court of Appeals, meant that natural gas pipelines could deny producers access to their lines if producers refuse to credit the pipelines against a huge liability - estimated at $7 billion by the Government -that has built up under the ''take or pay'' contracts. **********The consequences of the new rules on natural gas supplies will not be readily apparent until Monday, when many industrial concerns resume full operations. ''We are definitely not in the driver's seat,'' Mr. Loch said. ''We can't compel the pipelines to carry the gas. So we're trying to circumvent the bottleneck.'' **********Southern California Gas obtains its supplies from the El Paso Natural Gas Company and the Transwestern Pipeline Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/22/business/business-people-head-of-irish-airline-faces-new-challenges.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1988-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Head of Irish Airline Faces New Challenges", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Head of Irish Airline Faces New Challenges", "body_text": " **********Aer Lingus has named Cathal Mullan chief executive, effective Dec. 1, as Ireland's national airline prepares for an expansion. **********Mr. Mullan, 49 years old, succeeds David Kennedy, also 49, who announced earlier this year that he would take early retirement after 14 years on the job. **********''He's been in charge of the airline for quite a long spell, and he is moving on to other business interests,'' Mr. Mullan said of his predecessor.

Conducted by the Tanzanian Government and the World Health Organization, the meeting was the first major AIDS conference to be held on the continent. **********Its location allowed a large number of African scientists, social workers and nurses to present papers to their African and European associates, helping to bring more expertise and professional contacts to African health workers dealing with AIDS. **********The conferees were told that by conservative estimates, the cost of providing medical services to an AIDS patient is about 100 times what the Tanzanian Government spends annually on health care per person. Afflicts Educated Classes **********But even more devastating than that direct cost, said Mead Over, an economist with the World Bank, is the lost production of the AIDS victims. Mr. Over pointed to evidence, some of which was presented at the AIDS conference, that acquired immune deficiency syndrome was afflicting the educated African classes the most. **********''The impact of the indirect costs in a typical African country in the next 20 years, if current patterns don't change, could reduce the growth rate from current rates of 2 and 3 percent to close to zero,'' Mr. Over said in an interview. **********The costs of caring for AIDS patients are already being felt in Tanzania, Deputy Prime Minister Salim A. Salim said. Mr. Salim said such established and essential health programs as child immunization and tuberculosis control were threatened. **********As of July, the World Health Organization said, 14,000 AIDS cases had been officially reported in Africa. But Dr. J. Chin, the director of surveillance and forecasting for the World Health Organization's program on AIDS, said the 14,000 cases represented less than 10 percent of the AIDS patients on the continent. Trouble With Oversight **********Dr. Chin attributed the low official figure to poor oversight of health problems in Africa. He said the 90 percent under-reporting in Africa could be compared with what he believes to be about 20 percent under-reporting in the United States. **********In estimating the cost of health care for a Tanzanian AIDS patient, Mr. Over said that it ''costs as little as $104 a year or as much as $631 a year.'' **********This compares with what the Tanzanian Health Minister, Dr. Aron D. Chiduo, said was a $1-a-year per capita health budget. Dr. Chiduo said the per-capita Tanzanian health budget had decreased from about $3 in 1973 to $1 in 1988. **********The indirect cost to Tanzania from loss of work ranges from $2,425 to $5,093 for each AIDS case, Mr. Over estimated. Unlike the case in the United States and Europe, the AIDS virus is spread in Africa mainly through heterosexual intercourse. Control Called Critical **********The World Bank considers the control of AIDS a critical component of an African country's economy, and it has begun to finance African AIDS education programs. The first such program will cover almost half the cost of the AIDS prevention program in Burundi. **********The higher prevalence of the AIDS infection in the educated classes in Africa, who represent a small but critically important percentage of their societies, was particularly worrying, Mr. Over said. **********He said the effect might be lessened if, as has happened in the United States, the educated classes learned quickly about the causes of AIDS and altered their behavior. **********A Zairean study presented at the conference indicated that workers with higher salaries and senior positions had a higher prevalence of the AIDS virus.

CBS programs will arrive from a channel that is currently an independent. ABC programs will be broadcast from the same station as always, except up the coast in West Palm Beach, where the current ABC station will transmit the CBS lineup. In nearby Fort Pierce, the current CBS station will be an independent, and ABC programming will be transmitted by a station that is not yet on the air. **********It is a dizzying scenario, and it is also a logical manifestation of the Reagan Administration's deregulation of broadcasting. The confusing switches are a case study of the philosophy of the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Mark Fowler, that broadcasting belongs not in the guarded realm of public trust but in the hurly-burly of the open marketplace. **********Perhaps the most important of the F.C.C.'s moves was a decision early in the Reagan tenure to rescind a rule that required a broadcaster to operate a station for three years before selling it and transferring the license; the rule had imposed a certain stability on the station business, and inspired, many thought, a sense of connection between broadcaster and community. **********When the rule was rescinded, the business acquired a different tone almost overnight. What had tended to be a family business became a hot investment with fast turnover; licenses were bought and sold like commodities. **********And so, in the mid-1980's, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company bought a media company, Wometco Enterprises, that owned station WTVJ, the CBS affiliate in Miami. Kohlberg, Kravis also bought Storer Communications, which owned cable systems in the Miami market. The rules restrict cross-ownership in television in the same market; WTVJ was put up for sale. **********It was a moment when the station business was booming, and stations were bringing unimagined prices. WTVJ was to be sold to Lorimar for a staggering $405 million, but by mid-1986 the deal had fallen through and Kohlberg, Kravis was looking for another buyer. The logical purchaser, CBS, wanted to buy another station, having sold its St. Louis station in a takeover fight with Ted Turner, and its executives liked the Miami market. But CBS's chief executive, Laurence A. Tisch, offered only $170 million. Kohlberg, Kravis declined, and offered the station to NBC, newly under the ownership of General Electric, and, because of another F.C.C. decision, no longer barred from buying more stations. NBC bought WTVJ for $270 million. **********That deal created a bizarre circumstance - a CBS affiliate owned by a rival network. And it left CBS with the prospect of being without an affiliate in the 16th-largest television market in the nation after Jan. 2. So CBS entered negotiations with WSVN, which had been an NBC affiliate since going on the air in 1956 but, because of the NBC-WTVJ deal, had suddenly found itself without a network. Before a deal was concluded, though, CBS decided instead to buy an independent station in Miami, WCIX, for a relatively inexpensive $59 million. **********But the signal of CBS's new station does not reach up to the Palm Beach area, with its coveted upscale viewers. So CBS went to a strong station in that area, the ABC affiliate WPEC, and offered more than $1 million for that station to change affiliations. WPEC accepted. That left ABC without a Palm Beach outlet. ABC took bids and last month granted affiliation to a new station, WPBF, which did not yet have its transmission tower up but did have the $5 million or so that ABC was seeking. **********The current CBS affiliate in the Palm Beach area, WTVX, will become an independent on Jan. 2, quite against its will. **********It has been a sinuous course of events in South Florida, with fortunes made and lost and lifelong associations blithely tossed aside. The winners, in a business regard, would appear to be NBC, which now owns a strong station in a valuable market; CBS, which got a bargain on a Miami station, and ABC, which lost only a West Palm Beach affiliate but gained several million dollars and a new affiliate. **********A clear loser would seem to be WSVN, the longtime NBC Miami affiliate, which learned one day last year that its lifelong affiliation with NBC was nearly over. Edmund N. Ansin, whose family owns the station, reckons, with some bitterness, that his property will be worth $200 million less on Jan. 2 than it was on Jan. 1. It seems a reasonable assessment, given the difference between NBC's purchase price for an affiliate ($270 million) and CBS's price for an independent ($59 million). **********''It's heartbreaking,'' Mr. Ansin said. He has filed lawsuits against NBC and CBS, claiming abuse of the monopolistic power of affiliation. NBC and CBS declined comment. It remains to be seen what effect, if any, these events will have upon what was once the primary consideration in the business of broadcasting - the public interest. At the very least, it will be harder to sort out which bowl games are playing on which channel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/world/u-s-aide-sees-important-step-by-nicaraguans.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1988-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 685, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.

This is potentially significant, but we have had an awful lot of promises before.'' **********However, the move by Nicaragua's President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, which came at a meeting of the five principal Central American Presidents, was also seen as a possible maneuver aimed at decreasing the chance of Congressional approval next month for renewed military aid to the contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels are called. Contained Enthusiasm **********A senior White House official had predicted to reporters last week that Nicaragua would make some dramatic gesture of concession before the House vote Feb. 3 on the aid renewal. Therefore, Administration officials today were busy containing their enthusiasm. **********The State Department had no official comment tonight on the developments at the meeting in Costa Rica, said Nancy Beck, a spokesman for the agency. **********The senior Administration official said that it would take a day or two to get full accounts of the meeting. But preliminary reports, he said, indicated that the session had been heated, with President Ortega under intense pressure to move more rapidly toward compliance with the peace treaty the Presidents signed in August. **********''I guess he was banged on very hard by the four democratic Presidents,'' the official said. ''With the contra aid vote coming it had always been our assumption that he would do anything, especially things that were reversible.'' **********The decision to hold direct talks with the contras was reversible, the official said, in that the parties could meet once and not meet again. Nor did the other part of Mr. Ortega's offer - the lifting of the state of emergency - necessarily mean a dramatic change in political reality in Nicaragua, the official said. **********''It's very interesting,'' he remarked, ''but it's difficult to know what it means. Lifting the state of emergency could mean a decrease in state repression. But they could do most of that under the laws they have in effect.'' **********One key, the official said, would be for Nicaragua's internal opposition to ''try to act with expanded activity,'' to test President Ortega's sincerity. ''The key thing is not to let the pressure off,'' the official said, either from inside or from outside, in terms of support for the contras. **********If direct Sandinista-contra talks on a cease-fire take place they might also clear the way for direct talks between the United States and Nicaragua, something the Administration has resisted in recent years. **********Washington's argument has been that the Sandinista Government must first reconcile itself to dealing with its opposition, the contra rebels. Aid for Contras **********But if Washington begins some form of negotiations, diplomatic experts say, the argument on behalf of continued military aid to the contras may be diminished, since many in Congress would seem likely to favor the diplomatic route rather than the mimlitary. This is partly what has happened since the peace plan was signed. **********Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, said the Ortega announcement was ''news I have been waiting to hear for seven years,'' **********The Senator led a congressional delegation to Central America this week that visited all five of the countries that signed the treaty. **********''A central question in this peace process was whether it would achieve democratization in Nicaragua,'' he said. ''Today's announcement by President Ortega, coupled with the decision reached by all of the Central American Presidents, indicates that Nicaragua is clearly on that path.

Neither man was available for comment today. **********An Administration official said Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush had come close to persuading the President that he should cut off negotiations with General Noriega.

Shultz had apparently persuaded the President that he should allow the negotiations to go on. **********''The President does not want to slam the door on Shultz,'' the official said.

Kozak, has spent several weeks in Panama trying to work out a deal with General Noriega under which the Panamanian would leave his country and not return until after presidential elections are held in May 1989. **********''The President is the one driving the discussion of this issue, not the Vice President,'' the official said. ''The Bush people can take all the credit they want, but the President is the one who asked Kozak to come back. Whatever political cover the Bush people want, that's their business.'' **********Mr. Kozak, who returned from Panama on Friday, made a presentation at the meeting Saturday, which was described as a complete assessment of whether to continue the negotiations. Mr. Kozak described how a deal with General Noriega might work. Bush's Opposition **********The talks with General Noriega have generated wide criticism as drugs have become a leading issue in the presidential campaign. **********In a statement widely viewed as signaling disagreement with President Reagan's approach, Mr. Bush said last week that he would not bargain with drug dealers, whether they were on American or foreign soil. **********Mr. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, has fallen behind Michael S. Dukakis, his probable Democratic opponent, in recent public-opinion polls, and polls have also shown that the Democrats are perceived as better able to handle the drug problem than are the Republicans. The Senate last week overwhelmingly approved a resolution opposing the negotiations. **********Mr. Shultz and Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the President's national security adviser, appeared today on television public-affairs programs and defended the negotiations. They said Mr. Reagan was justified in using the indictments of General Noriega as a tool in negotiating his removal from power, especially since there is little chance he would ever be brought to the United States for trial. **********General Noreiga, the commander of the Panama Defense Forces, was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in February by two Federal grand juries in Florida. **********General Powell, on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' said, ''The indictment has some value, and its value is in negotiating removal of General Noriega from power.'' **********Justice Department officials say the prosecution of General Noriega is a key part of the war on drugs, and they insist that tough enforcement of narcotics laws is no less important than the Administration's effort to promote democracy in Panama. **********General Powell said the elements of a deal with General Noriega were ''pretty much in place,'' although President Reagan ''has not yet decided whether to go forward on this deal.'' **********Mr. Shultz, interviewed today on the ABC News program ''This Week With David Brinkley,'' explained why the Administration was considering dropping the indictments as part of a deal. 'No Ability to Extradite' **********By refusing to drop the criminal charges against General Noriega, he said, ''you make him a prisoner in Panama'' because he knows he can avoid extradition by staying there. **********''We have no ability to extradite him from Panama,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''So you ask yourself: Which situation are we better off in, to have Noriega more or less in charge in Panama, and us with an indictment that we cannot do much about, but nevertheless holding onto it? Or having Noriega giving up power in Panama and leaving Panama, but also, having paid that penalty, not having the indictment hang over his head?'' Reagan Passivity Denied **********People who attended the White House meeting on Saturday said Mr. Reagan was not a passive figure of the type described in a recent book by Donald T. Regan, his former chief of staff. Rather, they said, the President displayed physical and intellectual vigor and was familiar with the arguments for and against dropping the indictments of General Noriega. **********The disagreement between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Bush comes seven weeks after a bitter dispute between the State Department and the Pentagon over whether to use military force in ousting General Noriega. Early last month the State Department recommended a series of military steps, including the deployment of thousands of additional United States troops in Panama, to increase pressure on General Noriega. **********But the Defense Department, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, resisted those proposals, warning that they might lead to the loss of American lives and damage to American property in Panama. Moreover, they said, such steps could make it difficult for American forces to work with the Panamanian military after General Noriega left power."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/17/business/home-loan-agency-s-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Loan Agency's Rates", "print_headline": "Home Loan Agency's Rates", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Banks will set interest rates today for a three-part bond offering totaling $3.18 billion. **********One part is a $1.25 billion one-year issue maturing May 25, 1989, one is a $1.14 billion three-year issue maturing May 28, 1991, and the other is a $790 million five-year issue maturing May 25, 1993."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/business/what-s-new-in-consumer-electronics-double-vision-for-just-280.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1988-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 455, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Double Vision for Just $280", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS; Double Vision for Just $280", "body_text": " **********UNTIL now P.I.P. has hardly made a squeak.

One major manufacturer, Ford New Holland Inc., the farm equipment subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company. has scaled back its estimate of tractor and harvesting-equipment sales for the year by about 15 percent. **********And reflecting that more somber outlook, the stock price of the nation's only independent farm-equipment manufacturer, Deere & Company, has fallen since mid-June by about 10 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed today at $45.375, up 25 cents. **********Indeed, instead of counting on a recovery this year, manufacturers and dealers are now hoping to recoup lost sales next year, when farmers are expected to plant more acreage to make up for the drought's damage. **********''We'll probably see a shortfall in corn and the grains this year and a dwindling of stocks,'' said Bill Galbrath, executive director of the National Farm and Power Equipment Dealers Association. ''With less carry-over, the Government will encourage farmers to plant more acres to make it up. They're going to need equipment to do so.'' **********If the drought is a one-year phenomenon, analysts agree that is what should happen. ''Over all, the impact of the drought'' on manufacturers ''should be positive by next year,'' said John C. McGinty, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. **********Before the drought, equipment manufacturers were preparing for a solid, if not spectacular, sales year. **********In late 1987, the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute, a manufacturers trade association, had predicted that dollar sales of farm equipment would increase by 5 percent in 1988 from 1987, the low point of the decade. And with the incomes of farmers then on the upswing and much of their equipment wearing out, some manufacturers thought that estimate was much too conservative. **********If manufacturers now are not so bullish, they also are not deeply pessimistic. One reason is that most tractors are sold for the spring planting and in the fall to prepare fields for the next year's crop. So many farmers had already purchased tractors before the drought deepened. Capacity Reduced **********In addition, equipment makers have slashed their manufacturing capacity in recent years, and some were already having difficulty filling orders for some types of equipment before the drought. **********Because demand so far this year had outstripped Deere's ability to build equipment, cancellations from drought-afflicted areas have simply allowed it to fill orders from other parts of the country, said a spokesman for Deere, the nation's largest farm-equipment maker. **********On the other hand, the drought has already had a noticeable impact on the sales of equipment used to bale hay and cut grass, which are often purchased during the summer. ''Hay and harvesting equipment was strong through May and started June strong, but then it started to soften,'' said Hugh Cotcamp, vice president for sales at Ford New Holland. **********Dealers say farmers' hopes that better times were at hand have shriveled along with the crops in their fields, and many are now holding off on buying new equipment. **********''Normally, I'd have a couple of combine prospects about this time of year,'' said Ron Vavrina, a Deere dealer in Clarkston, Neb., in the heart of corn country. ''This year none of those people have come around. It's all on hold now.'' **********Mr. Vavrina said he had canceled his orders for combines and other big equipment to avoid having to carry it unsold through the winter. ''That will give you a pretty good idea of my state of mind,'' he said. **********Similarly, worried farmers are shelving plans to purchase haying machines from a Ford New Holland dealership owned by Earl Streacker in Findlay, Ohio. ''Farmers are anticipating we won't have a crop,'' Mr. Streacker said. ''When that happens, they clam up and conserve cash.'' **********Perhaps looking for a silver lining, manufacturers note that not all farmers stand to be devastated by the drought. They point out that with commodity prices surging, farmers who have stored past harvests or whose crops are not severely reduced could make a good income this year. **********''Does it really matter if a farmer sells 100 bushels of soybeans at $5 a bushel or 50 at $10?'' said Richard C. James Jr., a spokesman for Case IH, the farm-equipment-manufucturing unit of Tenneco Inc. ''We don't think the drought is going to have that big an economic impact.'' **********Makers and dealers also say their strong sales to the construction industry, which uses similar machines, have helped cushion them from the drought's effect. As Mr. Streacker put it: ''I sympathize with the farmers and sell to the contractors.''

But, it soon became clear, Drexel viewed this as a chance to spread the word that the same approach could be applied to the loan portfolios of many other banks. **********On hand was a bevy of the firm's investment bankers. But before they spoke, the voice of Michael R. Milken, father of the junk-bond market, suddenly filled the room. Through a telephone speaker-box hooked up to his Beverly Hills, Calif., office, Mr. Milken made the Mellon Bank deal sound like banking's version of the Second Coming. **********''I feel that what has been done in the case of Mellon can be done even more effectively for large money-center banks and their asset bases,'' Mr. Milken said. Although the bad loans Mellon was getting rid of were primarily real estate loans, Mr. Milken said the same techniques could be applied to troubled farm and third-world loans. **********In Mellon's case, Drexel is helping it raise $525 million of new capital and spinning off $1 billion of troubled loans to a separate new bank that will be partly backed by high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. **********Using deal structures similar to Mellon's, ''Financial institutions will have more freedom to continue to have a leadership position in international financial markets,'' Mr. Milken said. **********Not everyone, of course, agrees with Mr. Milken's scenario. Bankers say that deals like Mellon's are not likely to catch on as fast as he expects because they generate a one-time loss for the bank, which many can ill afford. Critics also point out that there has been more talk than substance to the idea of an active market in third-world loans. **********Even if deals like Mellon's do not sweep the industry, the competition over who came up with the idea and who markets it is already widespread. **********''Success has many fathers,'' said Peter Ackerman, one of Mr. Milken's lieutenants. **********According to Mr. Ackerman, the two groups besides Drexel that deserve credit are Mellon's top executives, and partners at E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company. The latter provided $175 million of capital in exchange for up to 20 percent of the bank. **********The exact origins of the deal will probably never be known. Industry sources say that for the last year or more Drexel executives have approached a number of banks with the concept of isolating a bank's bad loans so that investors could more fully appreciate the remaining ''clean'' institution. **********And Drexel was not alone. Salomon Brothers, for example, has also tried out a variation on that theme. The opportunity for a deal at Mellon arose last summer, when a new group of executives, considered by their peers to be among the most dynamic in the industry, took over at Mellon with the aim of turning it around. By all accounts, Mellon's new management had a substantial role in the way the deal was finally structured. **********''This deal started in a very different place than where it ended,'' Mr. Ackerman of Drexel said. **********For one thing, it was clear that Frank Cahouet, Mellon's new chief, wanted all the new capital in place before any bad loans were transferred into a separate entity. When Mellon transfers its bad loans to the new entity, it will record a $200 million loss that reflects in part the difference between those loans' stated and true market value. **********But while Drexel and Warburg have been in the limelight with the Mellon deal, investment bankers at Kidder, Peabody & Company are also beating the drums. On July 20, five days before Mellon's transaction was announced, a Kidder research analyst, Charles W. Peabody, issued a report on the restructuring of the banking industry. **********In that report, Peabody outlined steps of a transaction that turned out to be almost identical in concept to the Mellon deal. As it turns out, five members of Drexel's commercial banking group who had worked actively on Mellon's transaction left that firm in May and are now at Kidder. **********What about the Mellon deal? ''Together with Peter Ackerman and others in the high-yield group, we thought through the structure,'' said Marshall V. Davidson, director of Kidder's financial services group. **********It is hardly surprising that there has been such a scramble to gain recognition for the Mellon deal. The restructuring of the banking industry means big business for creative investment bankers. **********Industry sources say that it is galling to other investment bankers that Drexel has so actively mined this area. Drexel has been dogged by a Government investigation into its activities in the securities markets. And conservative bankers are usually considered among the least likely clients to go anywhere near a controversy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/business/business-people-a-mediumsize-raider-turns-sights-on-dravo.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1988-02-23", "snippet": "LEAD: Arthur M.

The 1990 portion, most details of which have been made public before, calls for a cut of the maximum rate of income tax to 53 percent, from 56 percent, and a reduction of the corporate rate to 50 percent, from 56 percent. Loopholes and Subsidies **********It is intended to reduce taxes by about 40 billion marks, or more than $23 billion, of which 18.9 billion marks, or more than $11 billion, would be recouped by closing various loopholes and ending subsidies. **********A Government spokesman quoted Mr. Kohl as saying that the changes amounted to ''the biggest relief for taxpayers in the history of the Federal Republic.'' But the package has already come under considerable fire from business executives, bankers and economists. **********After the stock market's collapse and the plunge of the dollar's value last October, some prominent economists at home and in the United States and other countries urged the Government to move up and increase the changes in order to stimulate a slowing economy. But the Finance Ministry stood by its original timetable, in part because of concern over a Government deficit shaping up to be considerably larger than expected. Questioned by Economists **********Government officials have said that the deficit might reach 29.5 billion marks, or more than $17 billion, this year and 40 billion marks, more than $23 billion, in 1989. These projections have led some economists to question how the Government will manage to both cut taxes and cover the deficit. **********Mr. Stoltenberg has indicated that the Government might have to raise some consumer taxes and cut spending further to balance lower revenues, but these plans have not been detailed. **********Several specific aspects of the tax changes have also drawn criticism. A plan to introduce a 10 percent withholding tax on interest payments on German bonds and savings accounts has been roundly criticized by bankers, who have argued that the measure would drive investors out of West Germany. Mr. Stoltenberg has countered that most West European countries have similar measures already. Moves by Others Cited **********Business executives also have argued that, even with the tax reductions, maximum rates will remain too high, especially when several other countries - most recently the Netherlands, Austria and Britain - have moved to cut their taxes. Last week, the British Government announced a plan to cut the top rate to 40 percent, from 60 percent. **********Mr. Stoltenberg acknowledged that these moves had ''increased the attraction of the countries concerned for inflows of investment capital.'' A West German reduction, he said, was ''urgently needed for reasons of international competitiveness.'' **********Another feature of the new German plan, which would increase the tax on discounted cars sold to auto workers, became a fiery issue in the campaign for Sunday's elections in Baden-Wurttemberg state, prompting the popular state leader, Lothar Spath, to break ranks with Mr. Kohl publicly. Benefiting of Rich Denied **********The opposition Social Democratic Party, for its part, has attacked the tax plan, charging it benefits the rich. Mr. Stoltenberg rejected the criticism today, saying that ''the reduction in the tax burden is strongest at the lower end of the pay scales.'' **********He added that the goal of the tax plan was to give relief to workers and the middle class and to improve the tax system from the ground up. The elimination of many loopholes and subsidies, he said, would benefit entrepreneurs and professionals. **********The plan presented today also resolved a contentious question by exempting churches and charitable institutions from tax.

'Way of Life' **********''People have been living with the talk of independence for so long that it has become a part of the way of life,'' said Peter Kittler, a German-descended Namibian who owns a store on the beachfront here. **********Blacks and whites mingled freely on the main beach here on the chilly waters of the Atlantic Ocean. A huge waterslide discharged white, black and brown children in a torrent of water. **********The prospect of a black-majority government in Namibia came a step closer with the signing of a peace accord in New York last Thursday after six months of American-sponsored negotiations among representatives of Cuba, Angola and South Africa. **********Whites are a small minority in Namibia - by one reckoning, only 76,000 of 1.2 million people, the great majority of whom are black. **********South Africa gained control of the territory from Germany in 1915 and has ruled it since, for the last 22 years in disregard of United Nations resolutions. Now, the drain on South Africa's economy, the political costs of the war against black guerrillas based in Angola, and the buildup of Soviet-backed Cuban forces in Angola apppear to have coaxed Pretoria to significant concesssions at the negotiating table. **********Its rich mineral deposits, thriving fishing industry and proaperous farms have intensified the international dispute over the status of the former German colony. **********After a decade of waiting, the white residents of Namibia - estimated at 46,000 Dutch-descended Afrikaners, 20,000 German descendants of German colonialists, 8,000 English-speaking settlers and the rest of other backgrounds - face the prospect of independence with a mixture of impatience, resignation and uncertainty. Exodus in Late '70s **********The number of whites has diminished from a high of about 110,000 in the mid-1970's. There was an exodus of perhaps 30,000 whites between 1977 and 1981 as a result of South Africa's agreement to a United Nations independence plan in 1978. **********Pretoria stalled at putting the plan into practice and was later backed by the United States in its insistence that the plan could not go ahead until a large Cuban force withdrew from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor. **********But this time, there appears to be a philosophical mood to the prospect of change among Namibian whites. **********While there are indications that some senior managers of banks, mines and railroads have begun requesting transfers to South Africa, there is so far no sign of a major exodus. **********Like many white Namibians, Mr. Kittler, the owner of the beachfront store, is skeptical that the agreed-upon timetable for independence will be met. **********''If the independence plan is put into effect and things get bad, then people will leave,'' he said. ''But it won't be like 1978 when many whites left in anticipation of the event.'' An Exemplary Life Style **********The white minority's position of privilege and prosperity has so far been barely affected by the changes that have taken place. Whites still control the wealth and enjoy a life style matched in few places. Fine hotels serve excellent German cuisine to the mainly white patrons. **********The handful of whites who have openly sided with the black guerrillas are treated as pariahs by most of their fellow whites. **********Swakopmund, the principal coastal resort about 200 miles west of the territorial capital of Windhoek, is a refuge for Namibians from the hot, arid interior. **********Its expanding population of 17,000 more than doubles as Namibians head for this coastal resort through the giant dunes of the Namib Desert. **********The relaxed racial atmosphere in this quaint town, a place of German colonial buildings, reflects the progress made in Namibia toward scrapping statutory racial discrimination. Apartheid Significantly Eased **********Apartheid laws such as enforced residential segregation have been abolished, and the interim administration is made up of a majority of blacks. Although vestiges of apartheid remain, there is little of the racial tension found in South African towns and cities. **********''We have done a lot of work preparing people for a black government,'' said Dirk Mudge, an Afrikaner who heads the black-majority transitional administration. **********''If independence had been put into effect 10 years ago it would have been a disaster,'' he said in an interview in his vacation home here. ''People are more used to the idea now and I think it will go more smoothly this time.'' **********According to the timetable for independence, a United Nations peacekeeping force will oversee a seven-month transition beginning on April 1, 1989, leading to elections for a constituent assembly by November, 1989. **********The assembly will draw up a constitution by April, 1990. One of the main points of concern among the white minority is that the guerrillas of the Marxist-oriented South-West Africa People's Organization will emerge triumphant in one-person, one-vote elections, a prospect considered likely by political experts. **********In the seven months before independence, all but 1,500 of an estimated 50,000 South African troops stationed in Namibia will be withdrawn. At the same time, the 50,000-strong Cuban force will begin withdrawing from Angola where it has been helping the Angolan Army withstand attacks by South African and American-backed rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence for Angola. The Cuban withdrawal is to be completed in June, 1991. Namibia as a Laboratory **********South Africa has announced a cessation of aid to the Angolan rebels, but a dispute remains as to whether Angola will, as a reciprocal gesture, cut off help to guerrillas of the African National Congress, which is fighting to end white control of South Africa. Namibia has long been used by South Africa's leaders as a forward laboratory for its own racial problems, and there is a wide belief among South African whites that the destinies of the two areas are inseparable. **********Swakopmund's position north of the South African enclave of Walvis Bay, which will remain under Pretoria's control after independence, serves as a reminder of just how dependent Namibia is on South Africa. Walvis Bay is the only functioning port to which Namibia has access. **********''It's going to be very hard to stand on our own feet,'' conceded Mr. Auret, the town council official. **********But many whites take solace in the reality that South Africa will continue to wield enormous influence over the territory after independence. **********And militant black trade unionists have begun criticizing some guerrilla leaders for cooperating with the peace plan and have started preparing for a new battle on the question of sovereignty over Walvis Bay, a South African enclave that was never a part of Namibia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-bloom-and-hill-holliday-chosen-nissan-finalists.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Bloom and Hill, Holliday Chosen Nissan Finalists", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Bloom and Hill, Holliday Chosen Nissan Finalists", "body_text": " **********The Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation U.S.A. has selected two finalists for its high-priced Infiniti automobile due out in the fall of 1989: the Bloom Agency of Dallas and Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos of Boston.

Last summer, when the proposal was disclosed, analysts and executives of long-distance companies had predicted that the Federal Communications Commission would institute the new system by Jan. 1, 1988. **********Some key members of Congress have warned the F.C.C. that they will oppose the proposal unless the agency makes certain that the plan protects consumers from rising phone bills and insures competition in the long-distance market. Members of the House and the Senate introduced bills in February that would block the F.C.C. from putting the proposal into effect. The F.C.C. has the power to change the regulatory system, but Congress can override it. **********Consumer groups and some in industry, as well as the MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest provider of long-distance service, are also fighting the proposal. They fear the plan would put A.T.&T., the dominant long-distance carrier, in a position to cripple competitors through predatory pricing, or allow it eventually to increase its phone rates. **********''It's a radical proposal in its present form and inherently flawed because it lacks details'' on its impact on consumers, said Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachussetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Telecommunications subcommittee. **********In response to the criticism, the F.C.C. plans to revise its proposal sometime this month. Gerald Brock, chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau, said the new plan would respond to the concerns of the critics.  Price Ceilings Proposed **********For their part, A.T.&T. officials said they were still hopeful that the new proposal would eventually be adopted. They repeated what they have said in the past, that they doubt that long-distance prices would rise if the new system were put into effect. **********The F.C.C. has proposed establishing price ceilings that would allow A.T.&T. and the regional Bell phone companies to set their own rates for long-distance service and access charges as long as they did not exceed the ceilings. The F.C.C. reasonsthat such price caps would be good for consumers and the industry because they would give A.T.&T. and the regional companies the profit incentive to cut costs and to bring better products and services to market. The F.C.C. would review the ceilings periodically to make sure that the phone companies pass on to consumers part of any improved efficiency. **********The proposal, which appeared to have widespread support from A.T.&T., other phone companies and the investment community when it was introduced last August, would replace A.T.&T.'s current form of regulation. Known as the ''rate of return'' approach, it limits A.T.&T.'s profits from long-distance service. It also governs how much the regional Bell telephone companies can make from connecting long-distance carriers to their local networks. **********Under the decades-old system, these dominant carriers submit cost data to the F.C.C., which then sets prices that allow the companies to earn a predetermined rate of return. The system is intended to give the regulated companies a fair profit and at the same time protect consumers from monopoly power.  F.C.C. Offered No Details **********In its August proposal, the F.C.C. provided only general guidelines for determining price ceilings. The agency's failure to offer details of the plan and its effect on consumers and the telecommunications industry has critics up in arms. **********''We are philosophically opposed to the theory of price caps for companies that have monopoly power,'' said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group. ''There is nothing in the F.C.C. proposal that indicates A.T.&T.'s power is dwindling. Nor have they shown that consumers would be better off under this proposal.'' **********Representative Markey predicted that ''until the F.C.C. explains the plan to us in an intelligent fashion, the agency will find little success in gaining Congressional, consumer, industry or state regulatory approval.''  Competitor Concerned **********MCI is concerned that A.T.&T. might be overly aggressive in lowering prices and thus hurt its competitors. Specifically, MCI worries that A.T.&T. will lower its prices faster than its costs decline. In addition, Washington-based MCI said it opposes application of the cap method for the regional phone companies because it fears that these companies, being monopolies, could keep the price ceiling for access fees artificially high. These are fees charged to long-distance companies for connection to the local phone networks. **********MCI had originally supported the idea of price caps but had second thoughts when it saw the F.C.C. proposal. ''We just took a look at the F.C.C.'s proposal, which was fairly philosophical in form, and said this is not what we expected,'' said Gerald J. Kovach, MCI's senior vice president of regulatory and public policy. **********Mr. Brock of the F.C.C. said the agency was completing a number of financial analyses that would show that consumers would benefit more from price-ceiling regulation than from profit regulation. Mr. Brock said the agency was still optimistic that it would be able to put its proposal into effect.  'Workable Proposal' Expected Edward M. Greenberg, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, also believes the plan will go into effect. ''The Congress and the F.C.C. are both very flexible on this issue and they will soon reach a workable proposal,'' he predicted. ''Changing the way a company like A.T.&T. is regulated is bound to be controversial.'' **********Since the 1984 divestitures, long-distance rates have dropped more than 35 percent - a trend cited by many industry analysts who favor retaining the current regulatory system. But analysts are quick to point out that the bulk of the long-distance price cuts has resulted from the reduction in access charges by the local phone companies. **********A.T.&T. must pass the access charge savings on to consumers in the form of lower long-distance rates.

The national head of the federal police, Romeo Tuma, visited the area of the crime in the state of Acre. **********A lawyer for the union headed by Mr. Mendes said that members were not impressed with the display of force or with the presence of Mr. Tuma. Last month, as the death threats to Mr. Mendes became known even to the police, the union sent telegrams to Mr. Tuma and other high Government officials but never received a reply. ''It was a death foretold,'' the lawyer said. ''It is too late now.'' **********A special investigator assigned to the case said today that the police were now holding four men in connection with the killing of Mr. Mendes, the 44-year-old leader of thousands of Amazonian rubber tappers. Threats by Ranchers Reported **********The four men are all either relatives or associates of Darli and Alvarino Alves, ranchers who had reportedly sworn to have Mr. Mendes killed. The Alves brothers, who are wanted on murder charges in two other Brazilian states, are said to have become infuriated with Mr. Mendes after he succeeded in having the Government declare a reserve for rubber tappers in a forest, part of which the two ranchers claimed as theirs. **********The police also said they did not believe the account of a fifth man, Darcy Alves Pereira, the son of Darli Alves, who turned himself over to the police on Monday, saying it was he who had shot and killed Mr. Mendes. A police official said the son was maneuvering to ''distract attention'' from his father and uncle. Besides, he said, the young man apparently wanted police protection because he feared retaliation from rubber tappers and others in the region. **********Mr. Mendes's killing has been the most dramatic among many this year in the lawless hinterlands of Brazil. In a conversation in Rio de Janeiro two weeks before his death, he explained that on Nov. 16 ''police told me that three gunmen were contracted to kill me.'' The Governor of the state of Acre even assigned two policemen to guard him. But gunmen apparently camped out for several days in the bush behind Mr. Mendes's home, where he was shot. Union Organizes Sit-Ins **********Under Mr. Mendes's leadership, the rubber tappers of the western Amazon grew into a strong union that at times organized sit-ins in which members and their families prevented bulldozers from destroying forest areas. Demonstrating that rubber tappers can collect latex, resin, nuts and plants in the forest without destroying it, the union has already obtained four ''extractive reserves'' from the state government and is hoping to gain other reserves to protect them against destruction. **********''Because of the union, a lot of people in Acre are afraid that they will lose power and money,'' said Moacyr Grechi, a Roman Catholic Bishop in Rio Branco, a town in the wilderness of the northwestern Amazon. **********Bishop Grechi was reached by telephone in the city of Manaus, where he retreated for several days. He said he received a call a day after the killing of Mr. Mendes warning that he too was marked for assassination. **********Asked why his life had been threatened in his hometown of Rio Branco, the Bishop said he believed he had disturbed ''a number of people'' by denouncing land conflicts and torture and abuse by the police."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/business/executive-changes-498588.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Barnett Banks Inc., Jacksonville, Fla., elected Albert D.

BOSKIN, for Vice President Bush, and Lawrence H. Summers, for Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, have emerged as leading economists in the 1988 Presidential campaigns. If, as expected, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bush oppose each other this fall, one of these economists is likely to land a top job in the next Administration and to put his theories to work. **********An examination of these two young economists is interesting as much for what it shows about the state of economics today as it is for what it says about economic policy making. In just a few decades, economics and economic policy have moved from one extreme to another. The Kennedy-era faith in government's ability to fine-tune the economy evaporated in the inflation of the 1970's. The Reagan Administration enthusiastically embraced - and subsequently backed away from - free-market doctrines that say less government intervention would unleash growth. **********Now, judging by Mr. Boskin and Mr. Summers, policy making seems to be entering yet another era, one of economic eclecticism: a willingness to fiddle here and tamper there, but a hesitation to offer up one all-encompassing economic vision. Like others of their generation, Mr. Boskin, 42, of Stanford University and Mr. Summers, 34, of Harvard are less doctrinaire than many economists who have made their way to Washington. While respectful of party traditions, they tend to define theory in terms of what works. **********Above all, they are sensible, said Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economics who is Mr. Summers's uncle and Mr. Boskin's colleague at Stanford. ''Those who are sensible are very eclectic today,'' he said. Joseph A. Pechman, an economist at the Brookings Institution, added, ''I think they're made from the same cloth.'' **********Both are also seen as politically savvy. ''Their exceptional value,'' said David F. Bradford of Princeton, ''is a very good grasp of economic issues and economic institutions.'' **********MICHAEL J. BOSKIN has often found fault with the Reagan Administration's economic policies, especially the President's early assurances that he could cut taxes, raise military spending and still balance the budget. Mr. Boskin even wrote a book, ''Reagan and the Economy: The Successes, Failures and Unfinished Agenda,'' that blamed the President for the budget deficit and the nation's low savings rate. **********But the criticism was delivered gently, which perhaps explains how the Stanford University economist maintained close ties to the Administration over the years without making any obvious enemies. Now Mr. Boskin has become the key economic adviser to George Bush, the man who brushed off Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign promises as ''voodoo economics.'' **********Mr. Boskin's work over the years shows him to be an eclectic conservative economist - a ''mainstream conservative,'' he calls himself, like many of those who advised Republican Presidents before the Reagan years. He raises the eyebrows of some other conventional conservatives in finding ways to accommodate a few politically seductive propositions of Reaganomics, but in general he would move the policy-making dialogue back toward the center. **********He's an expert on Social Security, and people close to him say he would alter the system to reduce benefits to the rich a bit to raise those of the poor. But that is not a thought he has offered Mr. Bush, who, like President Reagan, excludes Social Security from efforts to balance the budget. **********''He doesn't have any wild ideas - no fads,'' said John B. Shoven, the chairman of the Stanford economics department. **********The Bush staff and Mr. Boskin as well say it is imprudent to discuss the staffing of a new Administration, but he is an obvious choice for a top post, most likely the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers, a job that he, like most academic economists, covets. ''He's probably the top candidate now,'' said Martin Anderson of the Hoover Institution at Stanford, President Reagan's first domestic policy adviser and a current adviser to Mr. Bush. **********Mr. Boskin plays an intensive if episodic role in the Bush campaign. ''I'll get a phone call about something,'' Mr. Boskin said in an interview. '' 'If you're in town in the next few days,' they'll say, 'can we sit down and talk?' '' The callers are Craig L. Fuller, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, and other top Bush officials. **********''When questions come up, we'll just call him and say, 'Well, Michael, what is your reaction to this?' '' said Charles Greenleaf, the deputy chief of staff. **********Beyond the telephone calls, Mr. Boskin and the Bush office send campaign ideas to and fro on facsimile machines. Mr. Boskin prepares position papers, reviews the proposals of other economists and visits the staff every month or so. Early last week, he stayed in the Vice President's home in Kennebunkport, Me., being photographed at Mr. Bush's side and plotting ways with Mr. Bush and other aides to enliven the campaign. **********Mr. Bush has incorporated some of Mr. Boskin's ideas in his campaign proposals, in particular the notion of a ''flexible freeze'' to balance the budget - offsetting increases in spending for education, drug enforcement and AIDS research with decreases in other programs. The Bush camp has declined to specify those other programs, except for excluding Social Security. **********''This is possibly an artful device to announce that one would cut spending without saying what spending to cut,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who is working for the campaign of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. **********Mr. Boskin, aides to the Vice President say, has been brought aboard to examine ideas that make economic sense. Whether they also make sense politically is more the province of people like Mr. Fuller; Richard G. Darman, the former Deputy Treasury Secretary; Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, an informal but close adviser, and Republicans in Congress who confer with Mr. Bush. **********Mr. Bush has also assigned an important top-level role to Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984. Mr. Feldstein riled the Administration during those years when he publicly proposed tax increases and predicted an assortment of gloomy consequences from the budget deficits that never occurred. He has irked people like Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman since leaving the Government in faulting their overhaul of the tax system and in criticizing their policy of stabilizing the dollar. Mr. Feldstein's association with Mr. Bush goes back a decade and has so far been resilient enough to withstand the misgivings of other Bush advisers. But as the campaign grinds on and Mr. Baker assumes the greater role that many expect, Mr. Feldstein's influence could wane. **********BENEATH Mr. Boskin and Mr. Feldstein in the Bush campaign's hierarchy of economists is a second stratum that includes Mr. Anderson; Paul W. MacAvoy, dean of the business school at the University of Rochester; M. Kathryn Eickhoff, a consultant and former associate of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and recently chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget, and Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce and an advocate of supply-side economics. **********Like many economists, including Mr. Summers, Mr. Boskin supports the supply-side objective of using the tax system to encourage savings and business investment. ''Supply-side incentives,'' he said, ''matter a lot.'' **********He also said that he supports Mr. Bush's supply-side proposal to cut the capital gains tax to 15 percent, from a top rate of 33 percent, and the assurances that this would generate more revenue for the Government than it would lose. Many economists are skeptical, including some in Mr. Baker's Treasury, despite a Treasury report last week endorsing the Bush view. **********His support of the reduction in capital gains taxes aside, Mr. Boskin says he has little use for the extreme propositions of the conservative ideologies that competed for President Reagan's favor - the monetarists' belief that erratic growth of the money supply is an unfailing precursor of recessions and inflation, the thought of retying the dollar to the price of gold to keep it stable and the so-called rational expectationists' view that deficits don't affect the economy because people adjust their economic behavior to accommodate them. **********But like many orthodox conservatives, Mr. Boskin also makes a bow to the late John Maynard Keynes, the guru of New Deal Democrats. Keynes's proposition that the Government could drive the economy with deficit spending did not anticipate the inflation that soared in the 1970's and it offered no solution. **********''When the economy is in a serious recession, as in 1974-1975 or in 1981-82,'' Mr. Boskin said, ''there is some opportunity for a Government spending increase to get the economy moving a little bit.'' He would support the extra spending even if that meant deeper deficits for a while and temporarily abandoning the flexible freeze. **********MR. BOSKIN has hurtled along the fast track of academia that brought other economists to the upper reaches of Government, including Arthur F. Burns, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Federal Reserve, and such other chairmen as Arthur M. Okun, Walter W. Heller and Herbert Stein. **********Mr. Boskin was born in New York, the second son of a self-employed construction contractor who dropped out of college in the Depression. The family moved to Los Angeles when he was six. His father resumed contracting, while his mother took a job with the city, moving up from bookkeeper to accountant. **********He majored in economics at the University of California at Berkeley. For his senior thesis, he went around nearby Oakland asking low-income families about taxes and their incentive to work. The study was published in The National Tax Journal and won him the economics department's highest citation. He also won the Chancellor's Cup as the outstanding graduate of the class of 1967. **********Staying on to get his doctorate, he wrote a dissertation on the effects of welfare and other income-maintenance programs on the size of the labor force. It won the National Tax Association's award for outstanding doctoral dissertation, a prize that Mr. Summers subsequently won as well. Then Mr. Boskin started teaching at Stanford, interrupted just once, a decade ago, by a year at Harvard, where Mr. Summers was one of his students. **********''I would put him as my best graduate student during my whole 40-year career here,'' said George F. Break, chairman of the department when Mr. Boskin was a student and still a professor there. ''At that time, in the 60's,'' Mr. Break said, ''he was quite liberal. He was sympathetic with the student activist movement at Berkeley. I don't think he was active himself, but he was sympathetic. He had his mind on his career.'' **********Mr. Boskin explained, ''I was sympathetic with the goals - freedom of speech, civil rights - and I still am. But I was not sympathetic with the methods,'' such as student sit-ins and strikes. He added, ''I also became an economist and better able to analyze what were simplistic solutions to perceived problems.'' **********Mr. Boskin's wife of eight years, Chris, is an executive with the Hearst Corporation. The Boskins, who do not have children, live on an acre and a half in the hilly, forested community of Portola Valley, about six miles from Palo Alto and Stanford. **********Mr. Boskin's wife and friends describe him as a man with immense energy. He is a consummate tennis player, and he and Mr. Summers meet on the court when their paths cross at conferences and seminars. He is writing a couple of books on economics, teaches a graduate course in fiscal policy and an introductory economics course, both well enough to have been nominated for a best-teacher award this year, and runs a think tank that he founded at Stanford, the nonprofit Center for Economic Policy Research. **********''Sports, orange juice, our cat Norton and economics - those are his interests,'' Mrs. Boskin said. And politics. Like Mr. Dukakis's economist, Mr. Summers, Mr. Boskin toils without pay in the campaign and even picks up his own expenses. **********MR. BOSKIN and the Republican establishment have been flirting with one another for some time. He was offered a seat on the Council of Economic Advisers in 1981, Administration officials disclosed then. He turned it down, he says, because he was just getting settled into his new marriage. He was sounded out for the job of chief economist in the Treasury in 1985, but balked again on personal grounds. **********The Administration says it went to him once more late last summer, to succeed Beryl W. Sprinkel as chairman of the council since Mr. Sprinkel had announced his intention to go home to Chicago in November. Officials said then that they expected Mr. Boskin to accept the offer, but in October the stock market collapsed, and a fretful White House saw that as a bad moment to change horses. Mr. Sprinkel remains as chairman. **********This time around Mr. Boskin said he has not specifically discussed a job with the Vice President or his staff. ''I have no strong desire for a big title to put on my resume,'' he said, ''but I believe public service is important and noble.'' He added, ''I'm not lobbying, but I would hope to go to Washington for a couple of years sometime.'' **********Among economists, Mr. Boskin is known best for his recent work on fiscal matters - the budget, taxation and spending - as well as Social Security. ''Boskin's one of the very best people in public finance,'' said Kenneth J. Arrow, Nobel laureate at Stanford and Lawrence Summers's uncle. ''He did good early work in welfare payments and welfare systems. He's done good analysis of what the Federal budget really means and has shown budget policy to be riddled with inconsistencies.'' **********Mr. Boskin would establish a Federal capital budget. ''It makes sense,'' Mr. Arrow said. ''The budget now lets you say, 'I'm poor because I'm buying a house.' '' Capital budgeting would put deficits in a wholly different light, showing some deficit spending to be tolerable because the funds would be seen as investment. **********Another of Mr. Boskin's interests is the development of increasingly refined breakdowns of data to provide better analysis of how the economy works. Insufficient analysis, he said, got him into trouble in understanding the uncommonly low American savings rate. He had forecast a jump in the rate in response to tax incentives raising the return on savings, such as the since-watered down Individual Retirement Accounts of recent years. **********''I subsequently realized,'' he said, ''that we should have sliced the onion several layers further down'' in analyzing the effects of such incentives. Changes in interest rates and their effects on savings, he said, ''vary a lot by type of family, by age, by whether the family has a lot of assets and by whatever else is going on in the economy. While I do believe I.R.A.'s had a small positive impact on savings, it was overwhelmed by other factors that led the overall savings rate to fall.'' **********Mr. Boskin seems disinclined to rattle a Bush Administration by going public with policy disagreements as Mr. Feldstein did with the Reagan Administration, although friends say they would expect him to challenge policies privately. If he found a proposition to be bad economics, said Mr. Shoven, the Stanford chairman, ''He would tell the President, 'That's ridiculous.' But he would not take his differences to the press.''  A GUIDE TO THE ADVISERS' VIEWS ON SOME KEY ECONOMIC ISSUES  Comparing the views of Michael J. Boskin, economic adviser to George Bush, and Lawrence H. Summers, economic adviser to Michael Dukakis. Their positions are not necessarily those of the candidates.  BUDGET **********BOSKIN: Balance in 4 or 5 years. Adopt ''flexible freeze'' permitting spending increases as long as they are offset by cuts in other programs. **********SUMMERS: Balance in 4 or 5 years.  TAXES **********BOSKIN: Reduce capital gains tax rate to 15 percent, from a top rate of 33 percent. Restore investment tax credit. Raise consumption taxes as last resort to balance the budget. **********SUMMERS: Let personal tax rates stand. Restore investment tax credit. Raise consumption taxes, impose stock transfer tax and enforce better compliance.  SAVING **********BOSKIN: Devise incentives. **********SUMMERS: Devise incentives. The 1986 tax law's curbs on consumer interest deductions were a ''good start.''  JOBS **********BOSKIN: Unemployment rate can fall to 5-5 1/2 percent without adding to inflation. **********SUMMERS: Rate can fall to 5 percent without adding to inflation.  GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION **********BOSKIN: Skeptical. Markets help industry grow and create jobs better than Government. **********SUMMERS: Use ''helping hand,'' not ''heavy hand,'' to help ailing industries rebound and steer jobs to depressed areas.  FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD **********BOSKIN: Recent rate increases were prudent, but policy was too tight last summer and again this winter. Current policy of monitoring many gauges of economy, not just money supply, is sound. **********SUMMERS: Policy this year has been effective at fighting inflation. The Fed should not raise interest rates to ''peg,'' or stabilize, the dollar. It should monitor many gauges of the economy in setting economic policy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/12/business/the-media-business-publishing-family-feuds-that-are-right-out-of-a-novel.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1988-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 890, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; Family Feuds That Are Right Out of a Novel", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; Family Feuds That Are Right Out of a Novel", "body_text": " **********WITH publishing empires adding houses, divisions or imprints, the kind of frenzied rivalry for books and authors that used to be fought mainly with outsiders is now just as often occurring within publishing empires like Random House Inc., Bantam Doubleday Dell, Simon & Schuster Inc., Viking Penguin and Macmillan Inc.

While the big houses will no doubt continue to pay huge sums for big authors, the growing concentration of ownership and the policy of most large publishing companies not to allow their houses to bid against only each other in auctions seems unlikely to benefit the average author. **********In unrelated incidents recently, a publisher and a well-known editor left for other companies largely because they believed management to be siding increasingly with rivals at another house within the organization. **********At another publishing conglomerate, rivalry among several houses for a book is said to have abated only after the company president played referee by telephone from an airplane. **********Such competition has created tensions not only for editors and publishers but for literary agents. If an agent offers a book to one house within a conglomerate, how will the other houses react? It is far less humiliating to lose a book to an outside house than to someone under the same corporate roof. When the loss is to a rival within the company, it is more likely to be taken personally. **********And if an agent offers a book, there is ''pressure on the anointed editor to acquire'' it, an experienced editor said. ''Otherwise the heads of the company's other houses are waiting in the wings to complain about their colleague's lack of enthusiasm.'' **********Recently, Ms. Urban even faced the problem of four editors at one imprint being interested in one of her authors. **********''I finally went to the head of the house, explained the situation and said, 'Help,' '' she said. ''The head of that house was excellent in remedying what could have been a messy situation. There were still noses out of joint, but everyone understood that it's a problem - and that it will happen more and more.'' **********Offering his big-money author around a year ago, one agent tried to sidestep the possibility of an intracompany rivalry by passing up a big conglomerate publisher in favor of a house without other imprints. He was able to get the same amount from the smaller house, he said, without running the risk of disappointing several publishers at the conglomerate. **********That risk is real because of the jockeying that goes on within a company hierarchy, with the head of each house needing to demonstrate that house's superiority. Individual editors try to distinguish themselves within the organization, and ''there is wild competition,'' Ms. Urban said. **********Richard E. Snyder, chairman of Simon & Schuster Inc., said he welcomes the competition between Summit Books, a division of the company, and Simon & Schuster, and he even allows them to compete at auction for the same book. **********''As long as there are two other players, Summit and Simon & Schuster can bid against each other,'' he explained. ''Once it gets down to only one other house, one of ours has to drop out. In the few times that has happened, we decided it with a coin toss.'' **********But he contends that Simon & Schuster is faced much less often than some of its competitors with problems of in-house rivalry, ''because, while we buy lots of companies, it was a matter of strategic policy not to acquire other trade book houses.'' **********Inevitably, perhaps, the pressures and the infighting have raised within the industry doubts and suspicions of a kind that had rarely surfaced before. **********For example, some industry officials say an inter-house rivalry led a mass-market publisher to refuse to participate as a partner in a recent auction with a hardcover house under the same ownership. **********Others say the recent departure of a well-regarded editor from a medium-size house resulted from her losing books and authors to a colleague who has been conducting a virtual publicity campaign on her own behalf. **********Neither claim may be true. But just the fact that each is widely thought to be true is an indication of how ferocious the in-house competition has become."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/23/business/briefs-209588.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Applied Magnetics Corp. has established a $30 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in 1990 with First Interstate Bank of California. *********** AST Research Inc. has revised its credit facility and increased it to $90 million from $75 million.

No Specific Plans **********A source close to Kohlberg insisted that the investment company had no specific plans. But because it wanted to discuss Texaco's future with Texaco's management, it had to make the Federal filing and change its passive investment to an active one. Kohlberg did not make the filing in order to buy more shares, the source said. **********Kohlberg's statement did not indicate what plans, if any, it envisioned for Texaco, which last week won court approval to emerge from nearly a year of protection of the bankruptcy courts. The company sought the court's protection after it lost a suit brought by Pennzoil over Texaco's 1984 acquisition of the Getty Oil Company, and eventually agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion to settle the judgment. **********Texaco is already under pressure from Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of the company and is engaged in a proxy fight to elect five members to the company's board. Surprised But Pleased **********''I'm surprised but I'm also pleased,'' Mr. Icahn said yesterday. ''I think it's always good for shareholders when a large, sophisticated investor buys a stake. More than that I can't say; I don't know.'' **********Mr. Icahn has previously said that he thinks the company should be sold. **********Two other parties have sought Federal permission to buy more than 15 percent of Texaco's shares. T. Boone Pickens, the chairman of Mesa Petroleum, got such permission earlier this month, although it is not clear if he has used it. Also, the Getty Petroleum Company, an independent gasoline marketer, has asked permission. Mystery Block of Shares **********According to one Texaco source, the petroleum company's executives were relieved that it was Kohlberg, which has worked with managements in takeover situations in the past, that owns the 11.9 million shares and not a firm that is known for hostile restructurings. The company and those who follow it have been speculating for months about the ownership of a large block of stock held by Bear, Stearns and executives now believe that it is the block Kohlberg owns. A Courtesy Call **********A Kohlberg, Kravis source said that Henry Kravis, one of the investment firm's principals, had called James Kinnear, the president of Texaco, on Monday as a courtesy to tell him of the impending filing. **********Wall Street takeover specialists speculated that Kohlberg was now in position to profit from playing a role in the friendly reorganization of the company or, through its ownership, simply see the value of its investment rise if the company were broken up. **********''It seems to be headed for the auction block,'' said Donald L. Fernow, an analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities, who cited stock price as a clue. Other large oil companies, like Mobil and Exxon, are selling for about 10 times earnings, he pointed out. Texaco, he estimated, will have earnings of $2.60 this year, and because of the Pennzoil judgment and other challenges, should sell for about 9 times earings, or about $23, but is now selling for more than twice that.  . . .

Austerity programs to generate money to pay off bank loans have severely reduced imports by most of these countries. **********Moreover, the bank itself is an important buyer of American equipment used to build power stations, bridges, fertilizer plants and other projects supported by World Bank loans. Last year American companies received $1.6 billion in World Bank contracts. U.S. Jobs and Exports **********''The World Bank means jobs and exports for the United States,'' said William T. Archey, vice president international of the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has been a leader of efforts to focus lawmakers' attention on the capital increase. **********The opposition in Congress appears to be waning, and legislative analysts say the first contribution from the United States could be attached to the foreign aid appropriations bill later this summer. Last month two committee votes advanced the capital increase in the House and the Senate. **********Until recently an unusual coalition of liberal and conservative lawmakers has blocked any action on a bill asking taxpayers for $13.8 billion as the American share. Only $420 millioon would be paid up front. The rest would be callable capital - a promise to pay in the future if the bank somehow becomes unable to pay off its own borrowings. **********Most other countries have already approved the infusion of capital. It was ratified April 27 by 133 of the bank's 151 members, representing 77 percent of existing shares. A 75-percent majority was required. Among the countries that have not responded are Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Qatar, Rumania, Rwanda, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Southern Yemen. U.S. Is Biggest Shareholder **********But it is considered essential for the bank's biggest shareholder and founding member to go along or other members might reconsider their support. Also, if the bank does not get American support on the issue, the financial markets could lower the bank's credit standing. Over the longer term, rejection by Congress would probably mean the end of the 44-year-old organization, many analysts have warned. **********Now confident of Congressional support, World Bank President Barber B. Conable Jr., a former lawmaker, has already announced plans for a 10 percent a year increase in lending. For the bank's fiscal year ended June 30, loans totaled $14.8 billion, up 4 percent from the preceding year, a total that does not include loans made by the International Development Association affiliate, which lends to the poorest nations. I.D.A. loans rose to $4.3 billion over the fiscal year, up 18 percent over the previous year. About half the I.D.A. money was earmarked for sub-Saharan Africa. **********The bank finances more than 85 percent of its loans by borrowing in world capital markets. A larger capital base would support both additional borrowing and lending. The fresh $74.8 billion would increase capital from $96 billion to $171.4 billion after six years. Bleak Prospects in May **********Prospects for the capital increase appeared bleakest last May 25 when the House passed a foreign aid appropriation bill containing no money for the bank. **********That was chiefly because some House Democrats wanted to link the increase with creation of an international system to buy up third-world debt at a discount. Conservatives were also opposed, contending that the bank has a record of economic failure, a point of view that the bank challenges strongly. **********Then in June both the Senate Appropriations Committee and a House banking subcommittee voted to resurrect the capital-increase measure. Legislative analysts say it is possible that $70 million, representing the American contribution for the first year, could be restored in a conference between House and Senate on the foreign aid appropriations bill later this summer. **********''I think the prospects are brighter,'' said Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut. ''But it is a conditional brightness.'' Conditions for U.S. Help **********Mr. Morrison and some other liberal Democrats like Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts, support the bank but maintain that it should be required to follow a more ambitious strategy to forgive some of the huge third-world debt in a systematic way as a condition for getting more money from the United States. **********They have proposed that the bank be required to submit a long-term debt-management plan for 17 highly indebted nations, including performance criteria, such as changes in resource flows, levels of debt service and per capita growth. **********''We're attempting to set up some realistic process for judging progress, but there's flexibility in this,'' said Mr. Morrison in an interview last Friday. **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d insists that the bank is already playing an extensive and diversified role in managing the debt crisis Tired Borrowers and Banks While acknowledging ''fatigue'' among both debtor countries and commercial banks, Mr. Baker told the House Banking Committee on June 15 that the ''present strategy is producing results and moving us toward resolution of this difficult problem.'' **********He said that perhaps the most important change during the past two years has been the attitude of debtor countries toward making policy reforms, supported by both World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans. **********''While some are doing better than others, virtually all of the major debtors accept the need to focus on market-led growth, restructuring their economies and removing impediments to trade and capital flows,'' Mr. Baker said. New Brazilian Plan **********World Bank officials say they have played a key role in the formulation of a new debt strategy for Brazil, the third world's biggest debtor. Last year Brazil suspended payment on $67 billion in debt to private banks. It has now reached agreement with a steering committee of creditor banks under which it would receive $5.2 billion of new money to help cover its financing needs through 1989. **********But the World Bank helped pave the way for that arrangement by letting the commercial banks know it was prepared to double its own commitments to Brazil over the next fiscal year, to more than $2 billion. **********''The World Bank is looking forward to supporting Brazil's reform process, and to strengthening its steady, consistent implementation with adequate financial assistance,'' Mr. Conable said in a letter addressed to the international financial community."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/15/business/the-media-business-drought-s-peril-for-publishers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Drought's Peril For Publishers", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Drought's Peril For Publishers", "body_text": " **********The drought-related increase in soybean prices is raising concerns among newspaper publishers who have switched from conventional petroleum ink to ink made from soybean oil. **********About 600 newspapers, including The Boston Globe and The Detroit Free Press, use soybean oil ink in their color operations, according to the American Newspaper Publishers Association.

Act?", "body_text": " **********IS Uncle Sam planning to take the ''free'' out of frequent flier awards? **********''It's fairly clear that frequent flier benefits are taxable,'' says Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service. But the agency's 1985 proposal to tax pleasure trips earned through business travel was shelved in the face of bitter opposition from the airlines. **********Now this opposition is beginning to lose its sting. An attempt to tax those free flights to Hawaii and Disneyland would still set off howls of protest from business travelers. But it is the airlines, not their passengers, that have kept the revenuers at bay. And while none of the carriers will admit it openly, some would welcome the excuse to dump their increasingly expensive programs. Taxation would also please many employers, which view frequent flier bonuses as a poorly disguised incentive for larceny. **********Most frequent fliers see their bonuses as volume discounts, like the box of Bics the office supply store throws in with every case of note pads. ''If I fly 10 times to see my mother and I get the 11th free, no problem,'' says Emil Sunley, director of tax analysis at Deloitte Haskins & Sells. But most frequent fliers are traveling for business, and their employers deduct the cost as a business expense. If the bonus is then used for pleasure travel it is taxable income-in-kind, equivalent to, say, use of a company car on weekends. **********Translating this sound theory into workable regulations would be no small chore. Airlines could provide the I.R.S. with information on how mileage points were used. But who would be responsible for distinguishing nontaxable bonuses, earned through pleasure travel, from business-related bonuses? And which fares would apply in determining their taxable value: the $850 unrestricted fare, or the $159 fly-at-midnight, vacationers' special? **********Any rules of thumb would inevitably be unfair to some taxpayers. But as Jerome Kurtz, a former commissioner of the I.R.S., points out, tax regulations are already full of solutions to comparably vexing questions. In any case, the decision to tax the bonuses turns on political rather than administrative issues. And here the airlines' changing interests are critical. **********Daniel Kasper, an economist at Harbridge House, a Boston consulting concern, notes that American Airlines ''was way ahead of the game'' when it created the first frequent flier program in 1980. The incentives were extremely successful in generating brand-name loyalty among business travelers. They also shielded established carriers against upstarts: once travelers accumulated mileage points on one airline, they were reluctant to start from scratch with another. **********John Holland, publisher of the Business Flyer newsletter, estimates that the airlines distributed about a billion dollars worth of free trips in 1986. The out-of-pocket cost was trivial, though, because virtually all the passengers filled seats that would have gone empty. Why, then, are some carriers now having second thoughts? The cumulative impact of billions of unused mileage points is beginning to be felt on the bottom line. **********According to Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, some 2.7 million frequent flier members have accrued more than 20,000 points in the airline mileage banks. The special triple mileage awards alone, he says, could cost the industry as much as $940 million this year by displacing paying passengers. Other analysts think this figure is exaggerated. But the Financial Accounting Standards Board is likely to require the airlines to acknowledge some burden on their balance sheets. And according to one senior industry executive, many airlines ''would be more than happy to jettison'' the frequent flier liability before they lose control of the costs. **********Actually, more is at stake than a few hundred million in tax revenues or the balance sheets of the airlines. Michael Levine, a professor at the Yale School of Management and formerly president of New York Air, argues that frequent flier benefits are a classic way to ''induce agents to cheat their principals.'' An employer (principal) can set guidelines to keep down costs - no first-class travel, for example. But the decision on whether that extra trip to Seattle or a stop in St. Louis en route makes sense usually must be left to the employee (agent). **********Frequent flier bonuses are the airlines' best tool for exploiting this division.

H. Robins Company followed Manville's lead almost exactly three years later, obtaining protection from a bankruptcy-proceeding judge against the 6,000 claims brought by women who said they were injured by the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine birth control device. **********Now the insurers for the two concerns are themselves positioned to break new legal ground. The insurers have negotiated agreements as part of the corporate reorganization plans under which all future liability against them will vanish, even though it is expected that more potential claims will arise as latent injuries become apparent. **********By agreeing to make contributions to trust funds that will be used to compensate victims of asbestos or the Dalkon Shield, the insurers have obtained settlements under which they are essentially treated as though they were in bankruptcy, when in reality they were not. **********''It's a misuse of Chapter 11 and a shocking disregard by everyone involved in the proceedings, including the judges who have so far upheld it,'' said Vern Countryman, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Law School who is representing some of the claimants in the Manville case. ''This will open up the door to some uses of bankruptcy law that are just not proper.'' **********Other participants in the reorganizations said the arrangement with the insurers was the only way to structure the plans and obtain the consent of the leading players. **********Manville and Robins are poised to emerge from Chapter 11, having devised reorganization plans. Manville's plan was approved by a Federal court in December 1985. Robins executives are awaiting the outcome of a vote of claimants in an election that ends July 11. Nearly 200,000 ballots were mailed. **********Neither plan can become effective until objections raised against the treatment of the insurers are resolved by Federal appeals courts or the Supreme Court. Two appeals courts have already ruled in favor of the insurance companies, but they continue to be challenged in related proceedings. **********''The argument for the insurers is one of finality, that the bankruptcy code is intended to put to rest the financial problems of a company,'' said Martin I. Klein, a partner at Dreyer & Traub in New York and former chairman of the American Bar Association bankruptcy litigation committee. ''The counterargument is that the insurance companies are deep pockets who went into these deals with eyes open and should as part of any policy pay when someone is hurt, no matter when that injury becomes manifest.'' **********The piggybacking arrangement between the insurers and the companies in both cases is similar and relatively straightforward: the insurers contribute to a trust fund that has been set up to handle claims that have arisen or may be filed in the future. In exchange, the insurers get the blessing of the bankruptcy proceeding that no claims - now or later - can be asserted against them. **********In the case of Manville, 29 insurance carriers have agreed to pay more than $700 million to the trust. In exchange, a Federal judge has enjoined all present and future claims from being asserted against the insurers. **********Last week a challenge to the Manville plan was filed in the Supreme Court. The appeal, seeking to reverse a ruling by a three-judge appellate panel in Manhattan, was filed by the MacArthur Company, a Minneapolis-based building materials distributor. MacArthur argues in court papers that it was denied due process of law because the settlement bars vendors from asserting future claims against insurers. **********Manville asserts that the settlement with the insurers was a crucial element of the plan, ending a long-running battle over who should bear the cost of the claims asserted by thousands of people who said they had been injured by asbestos. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, it will not likely be decided before next year. **********More immediately, the Robins case will get its first test next week. Federal District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. is expected to hear challenges from lawyers for some claimants to a settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against the Aetna Life and Casualty Company. The Robins plan contemplates that Aetna will pay $425 million to satisfy any claims that may be brought by Robins, the women, spouses and children who claim injuries, and in settlement of a separate class action suit brought against the company by Dalkon Shield claimants. **********Lawyers involved in the case expect that the settlement will be approved by Judge Merhige, who took an active role in negotiating its terms. But the matter will almost certainly be appealed. **********The reorganization plan, however, might not be seriously disrupted if the class action settlement is denied by a court.

Is he there?'' **********A golden retriever named Taco scratched at a slab of concrete flooring and workers went in with picks and acetylene torches. **********Treasures were passed up to the onlookers - a makeup kit and a young woman's Soviet passport, gallon jars of peaches and plums still intact. Search Is Abandoned **********But after two hours, Taco was sent in for another check and she showed no reaction. The search was abandoned. **********''If there was somebody alive and she knew it, she'd still be excited,'' Mr. Richie said. ''There is an outside chance of someone buried very deep, but my guess is there is no one alive.'' **********As he spoke, there were shouts across the street, where an Armenian crew suddenly unearthed the decaying corpse of a woman buried when a local government office crumbled. **********Neighbors who have become experts in the logistics of sudden death explained that the quake had caught the woman while she dropped in to the city office, probably to pay her utility bill. **********Her daughter and mother had been found earlier, crushed to death in a car parked outside. **********An Austrian Army team had somewhat better luck today, locating the day's only survivor in Leninakan, but they said she was unlikely to live through the night. Precarious Condition **********The condition of the survivors now being found is so precarious that the Leninakan hospital saves all amputated limbs in a bin, labeled, in case they have to be restored for burial. **********The international contingent, estimated at nearly 2,000 foreign volunteers, is rapidly dwindling. Rescue teams from Switzerland and Yugoslavia left earlier this week. **********Forty American rescue workers, mostly firefighters and paramedics from Fairfax County, Va., and Dade County, Fla., prepared to head home on Friday. **********They were replaced today by 20 new arrivals from the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, who will stay until they are asked to leave. **********''Our dog teams are just out of it,'' said Bruce Barton, a rescue coordinator from the State Department's office of foreign disaster assistance. ''They are physically exhausted and the smell is pretty bad, so it's getting pretty hard for them to distinguish anything.'' Worn Down by Horrors **********Human members of the team have been worn down by the horrors they have seen and by trying to sleep at night in tents at the Leninakan airport, under the roar of planes and helicopters. **********''It's been extremely cold and tense,'' Mr. Barton said. ''Nobody from the Americas has ever seen anything like this before.'' **********Although the Soviet press has sharply criticized Soviet inefficiencies and poor preparedness, foreigners interviewed here said the overall disorganization was no worse than normally expected in major disasters. **********''I think they've done as much as they can do under the circumstances,'' Mr. Barton said. ''The cooperation has been terrific, not what I expected. You come here with the traditional American stereotypes, but the military and everyone else has been extremely cooperative.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/02/business/business-people-money-managers-stress-rockefeller-expertise.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1988-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Managers Stress Rockefeller Expertise", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Money Managers Stress Rockefeller Expertise", "body_text": " **********Two members of the Rockefeller family, David Elliman and his brother, Christopher J.

''They've hit bottom,'' said Thomas P. Kurlak, an influential analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. Mr. Kurlak, who was considered the biggest bear on the semiconductor stocks, turned positive about 10 days ago, helping move the stocks upward last week. Millard H. Phelps, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist Inc. in San Francisco, added: ''We have more positive times ahead.'' **********Technology stocks in general and semiconductor stocks in particular plummeted this fall as companies announced disappointing earnings. Two big semiconductor companies, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the National Semiconductor Corporation, have been losing money and have experienced a drop in orders. The Intel Corporation said its earnings this quarter will be far lower than expected because of a glut of its star product, a powerful microprocessor. **********These announcements, which came at a time when some economists were fearing a recession, gave rise to fears of a slowdown in the computer industry, a major user of the fingernail-size pieces of silicon onto which electronic circuitry is etched. **********The recent optimism about the stocks is the result of several factors: *********** The stocks have reached lowest value in memory relative to the rest of the stock market. While the Dow Jones industrial average last week neared its post-crash high, semiconductor stocks have remained near their post-crash lows. *********** The fundamentals of the industry seem to have shown some slight improvement as well. The industry's closely watched indicator, the ratio of orders to sales, increased in November after falling every month since they peaked in April. *********** The prospect of a recession in 1989 has faded and a computer industry slump does not seem to be in the works. Although some weaker computer companies are ailing, stronger ones like Apple Computer Inc. and the Compaq Computer Corporation are predicting growth rates of about 20 percent in 1989. **********Much of the slowdown in chip sales, some analysts now say, occurred because computer companies ordered too many parts early in the year. But, with some exceptions, inventories seem to have been worked off. **********Still, no one is expecting a banner 1989. Overall semiconductor sales are expected to rise modestly at best, and prices will be kept in check by some lingering fears of a recession. ''The specter that is going to continue to overhang the stocks is the upcoming recession, whenever that might be,'' said James L. Barlage, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. He expects that semiconductor stocks will rise only 20 to 30 percent before peaking. **********Still, even that much of a rise provides investors with an opportunity. Mr. Kurlak recommends buying stocks of the five largest companies - Motorola, Texas Instruments, Intel, National and Advanced Micro - as well as the stock of the LSI Logic Corporation and VLSI Technology Inc., smaller companies that specialize in the fast-growing area of semi-customized chips. **********Other analysts argue for more selectivity. They say the industry is dividing into haves and have-nots - those with products that command high prices and brand loyalty and those in commodity-like products that are mired in competition. **********Many analysts shy away from Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor, whose product lines are viewed as lackluster. ''Product portfolio is what drives the best opportunity,'' said Adam Cuhney, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. He recommends the stocks of Intel, Integrated Device Technology, Motorola and LSI Logic. **********Mr. Phelps of Hambrecht & Quist said several ''super-semiconductor'' companies are emerging that boast exceedingly high profit margins, growth rates twice the industry average and average selling prices for their chips that are at least 10 times the industry average. The companies that best fit that description, he said, are Intel and two smaller California companies, Integrated Device Technology Inc. and the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. **********Integrated Device makes high-speed memory chips, known as static random access memories, as well as other chips using very advanced processing techniques. By sticking to high-performance parts, it has remained ahead of the Japanese. Richard Whittington, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., estimates that the company will earn 88 cents a share in the fiscal year that ends in March, nearly double the 46 cents of a year earlier. **********Cypress also concentrates on high-speed chips that sell at a premium, and its growth rivals Integrated Device's. Revenues this year should nearly double to $140 million from $77 million in 1987 and climb to $205 million in 1989, while earnings should rise to 77 cents a share next year from an estimated 55 cents this year and 37 cents in 1987, Mr. Whittington said. Cypress's stock, however, is trading at a higher price-earnings ratio than Integrated Device's, making it somewhat less attractive, some analysts say. **********Intel has a virtual monopoly with its 80386 microprocessor, the chip that is the ''brains'' inside the most powerful personal computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and makers of I.B.M.-compatible machines. But Intel managed to destroy its earnings recently by vastly overestimating demand for the chip, producing a huge glut that is not expected to dissipate until at least the second quarter of 1989. Still, Intel supporters say its growth should resume after that as personal computer users migrate to more powerful machines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/20/business/what-s-new-in-subliminal-messages-covert-whispers-to-workers-and-customers.html": {"writer_name": "John Lofflin", "pub_date": "1988-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Covert Whispers to Workers and Customers", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES; Covert Whispers to Workers and Customers", "body_text": " **********THE fact that subliminal messages have gone public does not mean covert messages have become extinct. In department stores there may be the subliminal sound of jail doors slamming or police sirens wailing to deter shoplifters. The music piped into a factory may be cautioning workers to be safe. **********Last fall Dallas radio station KMEZ, with advance warnings to listeners, played 12-minute stop-smoking subliminal messages. ''The voice behind the music was reasoning with you, suggesting why you should quit,'' said Ken Loomis, program director at the FM station. ''The switchboard went crazy with people who were enthusiastic about the idea.'' **********But was it legal? John Kamp, director of public affairs of the Federal Communications Commission, said the agency had never ruled on the use of non-paid, public service subliminals. ''Our position is that covert messages by their very nature are against the public interest,'' Mr. Kamp said. ''A paid advertisement with a covert message is a clear violation.'' As for the unpaid socially responsible covert message, he added, ''the Commission has never addressed that.'' **********There is the question, of course, of whether a message is socially responsible. ''I don't think the Commission would want to get involved with that for obvious First Amendment reasons,'' Mr. Kamp said. ''And if we said, for instance, a stop-smoking message was socially responsible, the tobacco companies would come off the wall.'' **********Which is precisely what one did. The Texas Smoker, a Philip Morris Companies Inc. publication aimed at ''politically active smokers,'' wrote an editorial titled ''Big Brother on the Radio in Dallas.'' Steve Weiss, who oversees the ''Smoker'' publications, which reaches 1 million readers in 25 states, said, ''It conjures up thoughts of '1984.' Where will it lead next?'' **********David Riccio may have the answer. The Cranston, R.I., entrepreneur produces subliminals to deter theft in stores, promote gambling in casinos and deter rowdiness in theaters; he tries to appeal to all the senses with his messages. ''Even the subtlest visual, audio, tactile, olfactory message can contribute to the synergy of stimuli,'' he said. **********Mr. Riccio downplays the potential for abuse with subliminals. ''There isn't a shred of evidence people can be manipulated,'' he said. ''They must have a predisposition to the message and the message simply enlivens that predisposition.'' **********Not everyone agrees, however. Gary T. Marx, an M.I.T. sociology professor who recently published a book on police surveillance, frets about the ''velvet glove'' of modern technology. One concern about even socially positive subliminals, he said, is they can provoke unforeseen reactions. ''We live in a threatening age when no one speaks for the rights of the consumers of these messages,'' Professor Marx said. **********A Cleveland group called 9-to-5 is trying to speak out on behalf of workers. Deborah Meyer, its associate director, is blunt: ''Subliminal messages in the work place should be outlawed. It's just an outrageous idea that employers have the right to program the minds of their workers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/19/business/guinness-fights-ruling.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guinness Fights Ruling", "print_headline": "Guinness Fights Ruling", "body_text": " **********Guinness P.L.C. today challenged a ruling by the British Takeover Panel that the brewer acted unfairly during its acquisition of the Distillers Company. **********Guinness is asking the High Court to quash a panel decision last year that Guinness acted wrongly in the $:2.7 billion, or $4.77 billion, deal by indirectly buying Distillers shares in the final days of the takeover battle in 1986.

Any gains the students chalk up will be returned to the university for scholarships, professorships and research. 'State-of-the-Art Skills' **********''We thought it would be great if business-school students could be given state-of-the-art skills in money management and the university could benefit in the form of increased endowment,'' said Anthony B. Sanders, one of the two finance professors who will supervise the student investors. He added, ''If they lose their shirt, they lose the program.'' **********John J. Barone, an Ohio State trustee, was the one who persuaded the university to hand over the money to the students. ''I've always felt that education by illustration is better than education by books alone,'' he said. ''We can't afford to lose it, but it's well worth it for education.'' **********That such a large chunk of a university's endowment is being entrusted to students is extraordinary, higher-education officials said. Although it has been common for business-school students to chip in their own money to play the stock market, experts said it was most unusual, if not unique, for a university to permit students to manage its cash. **********At New York University, for example, a spokesman said the university ''never has allowed students to manage endowment and there are no plans to do so.'' At Columbia University, an official, who asked to remain unnamed, said: ''I'm not sure our administration would ever trust the students to invest the endowment. They don't even trust the faculty to do that.'' **********Nonetheless, Ohio State is convinced it is not being reckless.

Mr. Nichols added that ''if the students are going to spread the risk -diversify the portfolio - they need to have enough funds to do so.'' Conservative Tack Encouraged **********Indeed, according to Professor Sanders, who jointly teaches the course in advanced investing for which the endowment investment will be part of the curriculum, the students will be encouraged to take a conservative tack. They will not churn the portfolio by in-and-out trading and there will not be attempts to make ''big bucks,'' he said. **********But because such a substantial sum is at stake, the university is taking the matter very seriously. Part of the $5 million is earmarked for the purchase of computers and printers that the students will use to produce investment analyses. If, as planned, the equipment arrives by summer, the students should have the money invested by fall. **********Their goal will be to outperform Ohio State's regular money managers, who currently invest anywhere from $10 million to $45 million.

Responding perhaps to the doldrums that have gripped the apparel business everywhere, Sears recently told analysts that it was trying to add more national brand clothing to its apparel lines and was developing a new children's clothing line, called the McKids, in a tie-in with the McDonald's Corporation. **********But Sears had a 37.7 percent drop in its net income for the first quarter, partly because of a 40.3 percent decline in the merchandise group. Mr. Howard believes that the slower growth in that group, normally Sears's biggest in sales and second-biggest, after the Allstate insurance group, in profits, comes from the fact that the company has opened few stores in the last decade, when other retailers expanded. **********This is reflected in the 95 percent increase in shopping-center space around the country since 1974, he said, while Sears, from 1978 through 1984, closed 125 unprofitable stores and has focused since on remodeling existing stores. But now, in a reversal, Sears plans 200 multi-line and smaller stores by 1992, he said, adding to its present 816 stores. **********Colleagues say that the hard-working - 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. - and prematurely gray Mr. Howard is a team builder who digs in and expects everyone else to do so. ''He's tough, an excellent delegator who believes in freedom of action but is very demanding,'' one associate said. With Sears being pushed by the next biggest retailers, the K Mart Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores, the J. C. Penney Company and a host of local rivals, Mr. Howard may have one of the toughest jobs in retailing, next to his boss, Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears's merchandise group."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/05/world/pondering-the-puzzle-of-hussein.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1988-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 774, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pondering The Puzzle Of Hussein", "print_headline": "Pondering The Puzzle Of Hussein", "body_text": " **********''What am I today? A Palestinian? A Jordanian?'' **********The well-to-do Arab, musing this week, bears the name of one of the most illustrious clans in East Jerusalem, which in his view is part of Palestine. But, like many of his class, he rose to a position of great prominence in a Jordanian Government ministry. **********In a nearby office, a young woman whose family came from Jaffa tossed her head as her cousin, a Jordanian, teased her. ''I know what I am,'' said the woman, ''A Palestinian. I will always be a Palestinian. So what for your passport?'' **********Their reactions reflected the unease and uncertainty of many Jordanians of Palestinian origin, as well as some of their relatives across the Jordan River, over what King Hussein meant when he announced Sunday that he was abandoning to the Palestine Liberation Organization all claim to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. **********The unease is such that people spoke only on the understanding that they not be named, for fear of problems with the powerful security services. #2 Waves of Immigration Roughly two-thirds of Jordan's population of about three million people are of Palestinian origin. They came here in two waves. The first, largely urban and educated, came from the coastal region after the 1948 war that established Israel's independence and now live primarily in and around Amman. The second, still mostly in refugee camps with their children and grandchildren, arrived after the 1967 war. **********The industry and education of the Palestinians, particularly the 1948 refugees, has helped make Jordan a modern, relatively prosperous state. With little in the way of natural resources, the King has invested in the skills of his people instead, establishing schools that send many to the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries as technicians and engineers. The white villas that proliferate as this capital spreads into the surrounding hills are testament to remittances sent by expatriates as well as to local commerce. **********The native Jordanians, known locally as East Bankers, include the Bedouin tribes who predominate in the army and are fiercely loyal to the King, as well as Circassians, members a Moslem sect that migrated here from Russia and now figures in the security and intelligence services. Two Banks Interrelated **********Over the last 40 years, too, the East and West Bank have become interrelated in many ways. At any given time, half the Jordanian Cabinet may be made up of ministers identified as Palestinians. In a society where family is crucial, many count relatives on both banks. **********On the surface, the King's words seemed clear. Those of Palestinian origin living here should consider themselves Jordanian citizens, provided, of course, their undivided loyalty was to the King. **********But, in deference to the Arab position that the P.L.O. was ''the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,'' the King said pointedly, Jordan was cutting off all legal and administrative West Bank ties. Several Days of Moves **********The announcement came after several days of moves to distance Jordan from the West Bank, including cancelling a $1.3 billion aid program that had made little impact and was widely seen as a counterweight to P.L.O. influence, and dissolving the lower house of Parliament, half of whose 60 members represented the West Bank. **********Under arrangements with Israel, Jordan had kept many administrative ties to the West Bank. Most of the roughly 850,000 Palestinians there hold Jordanian passports, and Jordan has been responsible for many municipal functions including maintaining schools, hospitals and Moslem religious sites. **********Diplomats and Arab experts say the King was acting out of frustration with dealing with the P.L.O., and many believe he is hoping for an outcry for his return. **********The move has stunned the P.L.O. and its leader, Yasir Arafat. An emergency meeting of the group's highest body, the Palestine National Council, has been called to figure out what to do. **********One option being widely discussed by Palestinian intellectuals here was for the P.L.O. to attempt to step into the void by declaring itself a ''government in exile.'' **********But such a move has always been resisted in the past for fear the P.L.O. would be torn apart by its quarelling factions if it had to agree on any specific measure or position. **********''Of course if they tried to administer the West Bank, they would immediately become unpopular,'' an Arab intellectual said gloomily. ''This is the Arab world and Arabs hate to be administered. The government is always the enemy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/business/the-media-business-paper-tested-in-washington.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Media Business; Paper Tested In Washington", "print_headline": "The Media Business; Paper Tested In Washington", "body_text": " **********The Washington Times, a daily morning newspaper, has begun test-marketing the capital's first afternoon newspaper in seven years. **********The newspaper, which competes against The Washington Post, hopes to attract readers who turned elsewhere for news when the afternoon Washington Star closed in 1981. **********The Washington Times's editor, Arnaud de Borchgrave, said that the test would last three weeks and that 15,000 to 20,000 copies a day would have to be sold for the afternoon publication to be considered viable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/16/world/arafat-urges-us-to-press-israelis-to-negotiate-now.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1988-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1064, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARAFAT URGES U.S. TO PRESS ISRAELIS TO NEGOTIATE NOW", "print_headline": "ARAFAT URGES U.S. TO PRESS ISRAELIS TO NEGOTIATE NOW", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, asserted today that the high-level Palestinian political meeting here had opened the door to peace in the Middle East and that it was now up to the United States to revive the stalled negotiations. **********''We feel that the ball is now in the American court,'' Mr. Arafat said, speaking in English to underline that his message was intended for an American audience. ''This could be the session of peace if the U.S. Administration and Israel wish it.'' **********On Saturday, in remarks opening the meeting of the Palestine National Council, the parliament in exile of the Palestinian movement, Mr. Arafat had explicitly called on President-elect Bush to take the initiative in pressing Israel for concessions. View of American Control **********Mr. Arafat has consistently held to the view that the United States can order Israel to be more pliable in negotiations. American officials say experience has shown that Israel cannot be pressured on matters affecting what it regards as its vital security interests. **********The results of the Palestinian meeting, which ended here early today, did not produce much enthusiasm in Washington. **********Officials there were quick to note that the declaration of an independent state, and the failure of the Palestinian council to meet the known American conditions for dealing with the P.L.O., had been disappointments. The White House said that some ''positive elements'' had emerged from the meeting.  [ Page A10. ]  Israel discounted the Palestinian meeting and rejected its results. A Warning, Too **********Mr. Arafat said the council had given him a mandate to pursue a political settlement. ''But if we are met with a rebuff,'' he said, ''only God knows the outcome.'' **********''Let it also be clear I can always come back to our council and declare that moderation does not pay,'' Mr. Arafat warned. **********But at his last news conference of the meeting, the difficulties within the Palestinian movement over dealing with Israel again came to the fore. **********For instance, Mr. Arafat declined to say explicitly whether he believed that acceptance of Resolution 242, which seems to most people to imply recognition of Israel, represented acceptance of the Jewish state. In interviews before this conference, Mr. Arafat has regularly refused to be pinned down on the question of whether he accepted the existence of Israel. **********Moreover, George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Paletine, a Marxist and militant faction of the P.L.O., underscored his disagreement with Mr. Arafat, by saying flatly that acceptance of Resolution 242 did not mean recognition of Israel. **********''In my opinion, there's a great difference between recognizing Israel finally and officially, and accepting 242 and 338,'' Dr. Habash said, referring to the two key Security Council resolutions on the Middle East. ''I do not regard that the P.N.C. recognized Israel,'' he said. **********The session just concluded in Algiers, Palestinian officials said, represented the emergence of a new, moderate line within the P.L.O. In the politics of the Middle East, though, what the organization itself views as a concession often seems far less than that to the United States and some other Western governments. A Precarious Solidarity **********The P.L.O. comprises six Palestinian factions, of which Mr. Arafat's group, Al Fatah, is the largest. In balloting Monday night, 46 supporters of Dr. Habash's Popular Front voted against conditional acceptance of the United Nations resolutions. Mr. Arafat's supporters won a majority of 253. The vote represented the closest that the P.L.O. has come to tacitly recognizing Israel. **********But it was clear that the council, in adopting its political formula, had not made any effort to satisfy Israeli concerns. More pointedly perhaps, it had to be known to Palestinian leaders that the formula would fall short of meeting American conditions for dealing with the P.L.O. **********The United States, going back to 1975, has stated that it would not negotiate with the P.L.O. until the organization accepted Resolutions 242 and 338, and recognized the right of Israel to exist. The United States has also called on the P.L.O. to renounce terrorism as a tactic. It has emphasized that the P.L.O. had to accept these conditions unambiguously and explicitly. **********This has always been difficult for the P.L.O. to do, because of the differing views within the organization and in the Arab world on how far to go toward willingness to negotiate with Israel, which has stated that under no circumstances would it deal with the P.L.O. P.L.O. Decisions **********The resolutions adopted by the Palestinian council included these points: *********** A declaration of independence citing the 1947 United Nations resolution partitioning British-mandated Palestine into Jewish and Arab territories. *********** Acceptance of Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis of an international peace conference, linked with acknowledgment of Palestinian political rights, mainly the right to self-determination. The United States has opposed the concept of Palestinian self-determination, insisting on negotiations between Israel, Palestinians acceptable to Israel, and concerned Arab nations. *********** Condemnation of terrorism, but leaving open the loophole that force can be used by guerrillas in Israel and the occupied territories. *********** A call for the cancellation of all Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River. *********** A demand for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories captured in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and for Palestinian lands to be placed under United Nations supervision pending the results of the international conference. *********** Urging a settlement of Palestinian refugee problems. *********** A call for guaranteed freedom of worship in Jerusalem's holy places. *********** A demand that the United Nations Security Council guarantee peace and security in the occupied territories. **********Dr. Habash made it clear at his own news conference that he did not believe the P.L.O.'s initiative would work, but was not prepared to break the organization's sense of unity to oppose it. **********''Because of national unity, we are saying to our brothers: Go ahead and try, and we are convinced that you will come back and we will use another path,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/24/business/dow-slips-0.89-as-low-volume-continues.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1988-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 683, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Slips 0.89 as Low Volume Continues", "print_headline": "Dow Slips 0.89 as Low Volume Continues", "body_text": " **********The prices of stocks finished slightly lower yesterday as volume remained at the slow pace of recent days. **********The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.89, to 1,989.33, as declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by 811 to 552.

But now the image of a benevolent America is being called into question as a new wave of anti-Americanism moves off campus and into the mainstream. **********Students have long denounced the United States as a repressive force in Korean politics, accusing Washington of pressing a Cold War ideology that divided Korea into two nations and supporting Korean dictators. But even for the majority of Koreans who reject such virulent anti-Americanism, the new openness of political debate is prompting a more detached, more critical view of the United States. **********Increasing anger about United States pressures on South Korea to open its markets and pay for more its defense is dovetailing with a growing national pride. As South Korea emerges as an economic power and looks toward the Olympic Games here, a new self-confidence feeds an old xenophobia nursed over centuries of foreign interference. New Freedom of Expression **********''Questions about the role of America have been in Korean minds for a long time, but they haven't been discussed openly,'' said Lee Chul, an opposition politician. ''Americans say they are losing economic power, but we see they are rich, much richer than us. American pressure makes Korean farmers and workers mad. American realpolitik has led it to deal with immoral and illegitimate regimes.'' **********Students, who have long called for the withdrawal of American troops as a prelude to reunifying the two Koreas, are freer to express these ideas more openly in the new political climate. **********While few Koreans support the students' call for troop withdrawal, President Roh Tae Woo has said he wants South Korea's defenses to be self-sufficient by the 1990's. And many Koreans are starting to chafe at the pervasive American cultural and political influence here. **********Signs of this new attitude abound. Revisionist historical theories that blame the United States for dividing Korea are openly discussed in universities. A Korean businessman who numbers American diplomats among his friends rails against American immorality for pushing American cigarettes on the Korean people. The opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, though critical of student violence - like a recent attack on the United States Embassy - has said that he can understand student anger and has called on the United States to prove its commitment to democracy by supporting changes here and distancing itself from the Government. **********To some Koreans, the protector is becoming a bully that compromised its political ideals by supporting the authoritarian rule of former Presidents Syngman Rhee, Park Chung Hee, and Chun Doo Hwan. A Visible U.S. Presence **********''In the past, I vaguely thought of America with good will, but not any more,'' said Y. N. Chung, a 32-year-old carpenter. ''It doesn't mean I don't like America. Now I can see what is good and what is bad.'' **********Even as Seoul prepares to host the Olympics, a showcase for nationalism, Koreans encounter constant reminders of American influence. Of all the foreign embassies, only that of the United States flies its flag on Seoul's main boulevard next door to Korean Government ministries and near the statue of Admiral Yi, the hero who saved Korea from Japanese invasion in the 1500's. **********A major American military base, Yongsan, occupies prime real estate in the heart of Seoul, its rolling green lawns and split-level homes a miniature of suburban America. American television beams into Korean homes through the broadcasts of the Armed Forces Korea Network. **********Some Koreans resent what they see as American cultural arrogance. ''Americans probably see Korea as inferior, and it hurts our pride,'' said C. H. Kim, a 27-year-old army captain. ''All the shops in the area around the bases use English. Why do they have to use English and not Korean?'' 'Simple Resentments' **********Choi Chang Yoon, a senior ruling party lawmaker and former high-ranking Government official, traces two strains of anti-American sentiment here. One, he said, is the product of ''simple resentments'' of American influence and trade pressures and a corresponding surge of Korean nationalism. **********''That kind of anti-American sentiment is possible in any bilateral relationship between a superpower and a country under its influence,'' he said. ''We don't worry so much about that category, because it's natural, as anti-Americanism is in Canada or Germany.'' **********But he is more concerned about the students' ideological anti-Americanism, which he said was influenced by North Korean propaganda, and how it may be influencing the public. **********''Nowadays, anti-Americanism as an ideology is beginning to spread to people who have simple resentments,'' Mr. Choi said. ''It's becoming very complicated.'' **********The student protests are highly visible, and they have become increasingly violent in the past few weeks. Today, a student who set himself on fire Saturday to protest the American and Government roles in the Kwangju killings died. It was the third student political suicide in a month. In the Kwangju incident, in May 1980, Government troops crushed an uprising in the southwestern city, killing hundreds. **********It is impossible to estimate what percentage of South Koreans hold anti-American views, although it is clear that people who criticize the United States range from the average man in the street to some powerful opposition politicians. While Government policy remains resolutely pro-American, South Korea's new commitment to democracy means officials must heed popular sentiment - and opposition politicians, who now hold a majority in the legislature, are taking a harder line. Contempt and Dependence **********Part of the problem, Americans here say, is that Koreans still seek to rally American support for their causes while trying to push Americans away. **********While Korean students denounced American intervention, they asked the United States for support when they took to the streets last June and forced the Government to adopt democratic changes. While Kim Dae Jung criticized the United States for being too close to Mr. Chun, he was willing to accept American intervention when Mr. Chun's Government condemned him to death for sedition. **********Koreans display a similar ambivalence about their own history, looking back with anger - and a touch of shame - at a series of foreign invasions over many centuries by Mongols, Chinese and Japanese, among others. Some Americans argue that Koreans tend to overemphasize their own helplessness in the face of foreign power and underplay their share of responsibility for the tragedies of the past. **********''Yes, anti-Americanism is spreading, because its fits the psychological flow of the period, which is resentment over the junior status of the Republic of Korea in the relationship with America,'' said a Westerner who has long studied Korean politics and who has lived in this country for almost 30 years. **********''One of their problems,'' he said, ''is the agony of being under the influence of a strong outside power to which officials have kowtowed to one degree or another. The other aspect is a generation who don't know the Korean War and embrace whatever is useful in sustaining the damage to their ego as they look at their history. There is a temptation to see foreigners as being responsible. That way, they don't perceive their own folk as being all that bad.'' **********American officials are bracing for more criticism as the legislature prepares to investigate the Kwangju incident. The crushing of the protests helped consolidate former President Chun Doo Hwan's grip on power, but many Koreans, citing the close American relationship to the Korean military, blame the United States for either masterminding the harsh military response or acquiescing to it. **********''We are going to come in for a beating in the short term,'' said an American diplomat. ''In the long term it will come out O.K., and I hope we'll be viewed in a more objective light.

Milken. **********Certainly Drexel Burnham Lambert would not have been in the position of forfeiting $650 million to settle securities law charges were it not for its involvement in activities overseen by Mr. Milken's area of operations. But, then, Drexel would not be anywhere near so rich a firm were it not for the unassuming but immensely wealthy Mr. Milken. **********His name was not mentioned in Drexel's agreement yesterday to plead guilty to six felony counts. But the financial machine he created was clearly at the center of the Federal investigation. Whether he admits the fraud charges filed earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is indicted on felony charges the Government seems close to filing, or is exonerated, as he has always contended he will be, he has cast a long shadow over one of the more remarkable eras in American economic history. Father of Junk Bonds **********By extolling the rewards of high-yield ''junk bonds'' over their risks, he promoted a market that now amounts to $175 billion. In the process, his firm raised billions of dollars in capital for young companies and helped fuel the takeover boom with deals financed by junk bonds. At the same time, though, Mr. Milken's unorthodox sales practices and network of investors raised serious questions about the propriety of his techniques. **********One would never guess at Mr. Milken's almost legendary image by looking at him. **********Mr. Milken is self-effacing and modest in appearance. He favors sport coats over suits and wears a less than subtle toupee, providing a thatch of dark hair over his boyish face and deep-set, dark eyes. **********He has also cultivated an image as an outsider. Mr. Milken once labored in something close to obscurity out of an office in Beverly Hills, Calif., near where he grew up but about as far from Wall Street as one could get. **********That was the facade. Behind it was a man whose intense, slightly high-pitched voice over a telephone could cause some of the flashiest, wealthiest and most powerful financiers to snap into action and do precisely as he directed, whether it was buying tens of millions of dollars of junk bonds issued by one of his clients or helping finance a takeover. Unmatched Financial Network **********That, in fact, was Mr. Milken's real genius and possibly the cause of his downfall. It was not what he did with his own money, or even the way he singlehandedly created the junk bond market, but the network of wealth he could marshal to consummate the deals he dreamed up. **********It was an awesome financial force that he orchestrated with the deftness of a philharmonic conductor. It was also a network that no other Wall Street firm could match, or crack, and that Government investigators spent two years trying to unravel. **********Mr. Milken worked not with the Fortune 500 companies that make up the corporate establishment, but with entrepreneurs like Nelson Peltz, Ronald Perelman, Ivan F. Boesky and T. Boone Pickens, who were little known before Mr. Milken's junk bond revolution was unleashed in the early 1980's. **********Mr. Milken was able to turn his clients into multimillionaires. He also made certain that they understood just who was responsible for producing that bounty, creating powerful allegiances that he could call upon when needed. **********And Mr. Milken was more than just a financier, say those who worked closely with him. He was, they say, a salesman with an unequaled ability to make those in his financial orbit feel they were part of a mission, with his inspired sermons on the power of junk bonds. 'The Milken Experience' **********At the heart of the legend was what many called ''the Milken experience.'' **********In his heyday, this is the way it typically worked. The chief executives of three to seven companies would be sent to different conference rooms in Mr. Milken's Beverly Hills office. **********Surrounded by a phalanx of aides, Mr. Milken would march from one room to the next, delivering in each an inspired discussion of the chief executive's company, its prospects, its needs and what Drexel would do for it. **********The session would last just a few minutes, and would include a few words from Mr. Milken on his views of the general business climate or the global financial situation. Mr. Milken would then shake the hand of the awed executive, leave a few aides with him to tie up the details of a deal, and then move on to the next meeting. **********''The focus and intensity are amazing,'' said a senior figure at a major buyout firm. ''It's like a beam is focused on you and the rest of the room is dark.'' 'Michael Is Smart' **********Mr. Peltz, the chairman of Triangle Industries, said that Mr. Milken ''definitely has a unique financial acumen.'' **********''When I have a really tough problem, I go to Michael,'' Mr. Peltz said. ''But when you order a la carte, you pay a la carte prices. They probably get paid too much, but to hear them tell it, they get too little. Michael is smart but he is tough when it comes to money. He'll fight you all day for an eighth'' of a percentage point on a fee. **********Mr. Peltz is almost a prototype of the kind of entrepreneur Mr. Milken created. Until he became a Drexel client, Mr. Peltz owned a struggling vending machine company. After a few years in Mr. Milken's hands he controlled one of the country's largest packaging concerns. When he sold it to Pechiney Corporation several weeks ago, he walked away with a profit of more than $500 million - a Milken-sized trove. **********Mr. Milken has been the second-largest shareholder in Drexel, after Banque Bruxelles Lambert, with a stake of about 6 percent of the firm, sources said. His net worth is generally put at close to $1 billion and his annual income more than $100 million. **********He has worked prodigiously to build that fortune. At his prime, Mr. Milken worked generally from 4:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M., including Saturdays. **********But his abilities and methods evinced an unusual mix of emotions from those who worked with him. 'We Live Off of His Crumbs' **********''Michael has changed my life,'' said one of his senior colleagues in a comment echoed by other Drexel executives. ''If I worked with any other firm, I'd be earning from $500,000 to a little over a million a year in good years. With Michael, it's millions. We live off of his crumbs, but those are still more than what you ever dreamed you'd have.'' **********Added a former Drexel executive once close to Mr. Milken, ''When Michael says sign something, everyone there just signs because the pen writes with golden ink.'' **********Yet, that golden ink has also bred unease. **********''You have to appreciate the insecurity you sometimes run into around here,'' said one investment banker at Drexel. ''People know that they owe everything to Michael. They are rich, really rich, because of him. That creates a whole pattern of strange emotions.'' **********Mr. Milken appears to have never had any doubt about his mission. **********He attended college at the University of California at Berkeley, where he became president of his fraternity. His education took place amid the political turmoil at Berkeley in the 1960's. But Harry Horowitz, who has been one of Mr. Milken's closest friends since the two were in fifth grade, described Mr. Milken as too focused on his career to be distracted by the social ferment. **********''I asked him once why he wasn't picketing and he said you can accomplish more if you get good grades, get a good job, make a lot of money and contribute to the things that interest you,'' Mr. Horowitz said. **********Mr. Milken is now active in anti-drug campaigns and other charities focusing on young people, said Mr. Horowitz, who now works at Drexel's Beverly Hills office. **********He added that Mr. Milken is something of a health nut who has never drunk coffee, alcohol or even soda, and has never smoked. **********''He's a boring guy on New Year's,'' Mr. Horowitz said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/27/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-ogilvy-unit-looks-for-trends.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; New Ogilvy Unit Looks For Trends", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; New Ogilvy Unit Looks For Trends", "body_text": " **********''W E'RE trying to get down to street level and identify the seeds of trends to see what people are really doing,'' said Jane R. Fitzgibbon last week, letting it be known that something is in the wind at Ogilvy & Mather, U.S. **********But what? A brand new division is what. Three professionals and a secretary banded together under the moniker of Consumer Trends and Insights, a profit center whose services will be available to clients and non-clients alike. **********In that unit the feeling is that a smart person could have forecast the running-shoes-as-daywear explosion as well as the booming popularity of wine coolers, Ms. Fitzgibbon said, indicating that she and her associates Frederick Elikind and Mariann Fortuna are just such smart people. **********And they do not plan to do things as others do. They will not examine consumer consciousness via phone interviews or interceptions in shopping malls. Everybody is doing that. The C.T.& I. team will be commissioning interviewers to go into cafes and airports and among people just leaving the theater - getting consumers while their thinking is hot. **********Graham Phillips, chairman of the domestic agency, whose idea this basically is, said it is a way of formalizing ''our commitment to understanding economic, demographic and consumer life-style trends and turning this information into strategic opportunities for our clients, prospects and other major advertisers.'' **********His commitment is such that he chose the head of research in the New York office, Ms. Fitzgibbon, to take the job as senior vice president and group director. She is being replaced by Max Blackston, who will be head of research and planning. **********''We think we can link trends to client business opportunities in new products and new positionings,'' she said Friday, ''and we can give our creative people a new sense of understanding of consumers. We can ring the hot buttons.'' **********In the information age it is vital for consumer product companies to know what is going to happen before it does, so they can be there with the right products at the right time. Knowledge of changing eating habits, for example, is vital to Pepperidge Farms, and the changing structure of relationships is important to Hallmark Cards. **********With little urging, Ms. Fitzgibbon looked through her trendscope and said, ''I think Main Street chic is on its way,'' explaining that the yuppies' consuming passion for monetary rewards is going to be offset by more blue-collar pride in accomplishment on the job. **********She also sees a return to the home - not the home as a cocoon but as a beehive of electronic activity. **********That's the kind of pulse-quickening information that you can expect to find in the new HOT (High Opportunity Trends) Barometer that the unit will provide customers. **********The unit will also be writing a report on what temporary residents of the United States from Europe and Asia think about American ethics. Another pulse quickener.  Ms. Fitzgibbon, 50 years old, came to her eminence in consumer research by the same kind of devious route that most advertising people follow. She worked briefly in publishing after graduating cum laude as a history major from Wells College. Then she took time out ''for two kids and a divorce.'' **********The hard road back into the work force began with a secretary's job at Yankelovich, Skelly & White, the research company. Since she was a poor secretary, she was given the opportunity to do other things. That's how sages are made. **********She is never without a forecast. On Friday, as a departing reporter donned a Panama, she said, ''Straw hats are coming back.'' ''I know,'' he responded. ''It was in Newsweek last week.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/15/business/data-bank-may-15-1988.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA BANK: May 15, 1988", "print_headline": "DATA BANK: May 15, 1988", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/business/the-media-business-as-growth-slows-more-network-affiliates-are-for-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1988-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Growth Slows, More Network Affiliates Are for Sale", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; As Growth Slows, More Network Affiliates Are for Sale", "body_text": " **********For years television was known as a ''drop dead'' business. Profits rose so predictably that a station manager could drop dead and the station would run itself. **********Those days are over. Even network-affiliated stations, once virtually recession-proof, are likely to face tougher times as competition increases for audiences and advertising dollars. Although broadcasting is still very profitable, ''the years of double-digit growth may be over,'' said one media business broker who asked not to be identified. ''I think station prices have peaked.'' **********Nowhere is the skepticism more evident than in the fact that a growing number of network affiliates are for sale. Although station owners are cagey about acknowledging their stations are on the market, several industry experts agree that at least 15 of the almost 600 television affiliates are available, more than was the case six months ago. **********Among those stations are four owned by Television Station Partners, a public limited partnership; several stations owned by Gillett Holdings Inc., and a station owned by TA Associates, a Boston investment firm. **********Many of the affiliates for sale are in smaller markets. Many stations in major markets were bought years ago at low prices by big companies with deep pockets. These companies do not feel as pressed to sell even amid the new economic reality. **********Good network affiliates have been selling for as much as 11 to 14 times cash flow, at prices ranging from $11 million to $350 million. Steven Rattner, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley & Company, thinks that until now, historical multiples have held up because of the lack of supply. ''But the obvious increase in the number of stations on the market will probably have an impact on multiples and prices,'' he said. Reasons for the Increase **********The number of affiliates on the market is less a reflection of current problems than uncertainty about the future, experts generally agree. As one executive with a background in the television business put it, ''Today the fundamentals of the business are questionable.'' **********Interest in station deals has increased because owners are convinced that this is a good time to cash in at a profit. At the same time, there is concern that the tax laws may change after the Presidential election, resulting in higher taxes on any transaction. **********Another factor that has facilitated the sale of stations is the abolition of a Federal rule requiring a station buyer to own the property for at least three years. The elimination of that rule has attracted new investors who view stations simply as a commodity to be traded, or ''flipped,'' at a profit. The Attraction of Affiliates **********Historically, network affiliates have been enormously attractive. An affiliate gets roughly 65 percent of its programming free from the network, including not only prime-time shows but news programs, soap operas and game shows. The networks actually pay affiliates to carry their programming. Affiliates have generated pretax profit margins ranging from 30 percent to 58 percent. **********But lately the networks have faced increasing competition from rivals like the Fox Television Network and the growing number of independent television stations and cable services. **********New competition has already hurt affiliate ratings. Its impact on advertising is less clear because network television still delivers the biggest audiences to big buyers. But there are signs of trouble. National advertising in local markets remains sluggish after a lackluster 1987. ''The second quarter of 1988 looks weak for national buyers in local markets,'' said Robert Coen, the media expert at McCann-Erickson. **********Historically, television advertiser buying is very strong in an Olympic and election year. **********''It's not that business is down,'' Mr. Coen said. ''It was up 5 or 6 percent in the first quarter. This quarter it will be lucky to be up at all.'' In 1984, the previous Olympics-election year, national advertising in local markets was up 10 to 15 percent from the previous year. **********Growth has slowed by similar amounts among local advertisers, Mr. Coen said. **********''Stations have just not been getting what they expected from either the national or the local market,'' Mr. Coen said. **********Network affiliates get roughly 45 percent of their revenues from local advertising and 45 percent from national advertisers buying in the local markets. **********To complicate problems, the inflation rate has fallen, so buyers can not count on the double-digit annual increases in revenue that typified the inflation years. And the advent of the 15-second commercial on network television has absorbed a lot of advertising dollars that national advertisers might have spent in local markets. Prices Called Still Healthy **********In spite of this, the prices offered recently for affiliates are still healthy, said Howard Stark, a television station broker who is representing George Gillett in the sale of at least one station. **********For example, Robert Price, chairman of Price Communications, said, ''We've sold three network affiliates at a profit and all were owned for less than three years.'' Mr. Price recently sold for $33 million an NBC affiliate in Peoria, Ill., that he had bought for $15 million, and a CBS affiliate in Jefferson City, Mo., for which he had paid $11 million sold for $24 million.

His comment, by helping stir expectations, added to the disappointment. **********The revision contributed to a day of confused trading. Stocks and the dollar posted early gains but finished the day with losses. A late wave of selling also eroded prices in the credit markets. **********Fears of a looming recession followed the initial G.N.P. report in January. It showed that about 85 percent of a 4.2 percent growth rate reflected goods remaining unsold. **********The assumption was that production would have to be curtailed while these excess inventories were worked down. The latest report shows that consumer and business spending was stronger than first reported and that the buildup of inventories was slightly less. **********''This clearly showed a stronger economy than originally reported,'' Norman Robertson of Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank said of the report. ''It's very difficult to conclude we're heading into a recession.'' **********Other analysts pointed out, however, that the bulk of this higher spending went for imported goods, which climbed at a $13.5 billion rate instead of an $8.9 billion rate, as originally estimated. **********''Whatever strength there was was satisfied by imports,'' commented Daniel Friel, economist for the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. **********Real final sales - the G.N.P. adjusted for changes in business inventories - climbed 1 percent during the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department's figures now show. This is far below the 6 percent rate of growth during the third quarter but is above the six-tenths of 1 percent rate initially reported for the fourth quarter. Comment From Economist **********The inventory buildup was ''not quite as bad'' as first reported, said Kenneth T. Mayland, economist for the First Pennsylvania Bank. ''But I don't think businesses are too likely to be reordering heavily for the spring and summer.'' Mr. Mayland is one of a sizable minority of analysts who believe an economic contraction is likely to occur relatively soon. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters in which the G.N.P. declines. **********The 4.5 percent pace of business expansion in the fourth quarter compares with gains of 4.3 percent in the third quarter, 2.5 percent in the second quarter and 4.4 percent in the first three months of 1987. It was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 1986, when the G.N.P. (expressed in constant dollars) climbed at a 5.4 percent annual rate. **********There was no revision, however, in the pace of inflation as measured by either the fixed-weight index or the implicit deflator. They continued to show rates of 3.7 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. The fixed-weight index measures changes in prices; the deflator not only does this but also reflects changes in the composition of the gross national product. Decline in Savings Rate **********Consistent with the higher consumption figure, the nation's savings rate - personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income -edged down to 4.8 percent in the last quarter from the 4.9 percent estimated last month. **********The upward revision of three-tenths of a percentage point in the G.N.P. was equal to $2.8 billion, the Commerce Department said, meaning that the G.N.P. ran at a rate of $3,877,900,000 instead of $3,875,100,000. **********The main increases were $4.3 billion in personal consumption spending and $4 billion in spending by producers for durable goods. The largest decrease was $5.7 billion in the international trade sector, where the positive contribution was lowered to a $2 billion rate from $7.7 billion, mostly as a result of greater imports. **********Today's report also showed that the gross national product, as expressed in current dollars instead of constant 1982 dollars, hit a rate of $4.6 trillion in the final three months of 1987. This was at a rate 7.3 percent higher than in the third quarter, compared with an initially reported 6.7 percent rate. **********In publishing today's figures, the Commerce Department realigned its tables to provide additional information about investment, inventories and Federal Government purchases. Other data are being provided earlier than before or are being dropped from the G.N.P. tabulation. **********Data included in the first revision of the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1987 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

Complaints From Executives **********American business executives have long complained that the embargo list impedes trade because it includes many items of low technology available elsewhere, such as personal computers from Singapore, and it requires extensive red tape to enforce. **********Businesses have also complained that Washington applies tougher enforcement than other allied countries, with the result that American companies are at a competitive disadvantage. They cite, for example, computers that American companies cannot sell but which are sold covertly to the Eastern bloc by Japanese and German competitors. **********''The American business community places great emphasis on having the Cocom system strengthened and getting higher levels of adherence by all member countries,'' said Calman J.

However, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, referred to it recently in Bonn as ''the cursed list'' and said it hindered East-West joint business ventures. **********Fresh from meetings with Mr. Shevardnadze, the Foreign Minister of West Germany, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, arrived in Washington tonight for talks with top American officials. **********Mr. Genscher, a strong supporter of more trade with the Soviet Union, has been pressing for a conference on East-West economic cooperation.

In addition, the report charged, the Soviet Government exhibited less tolerance of demonstrations and imprisoned many people for their political and religious beliefs. **********In other East Bloc countries, human rights progress was described as a mixture of repression and hope for improvement. Soviet-allied nations included in the study were Rumania, Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. **********The document was distributed to members of Congress on Friday as President Reagan returned to Washington from the summit meeting in Moscow. It was issued to advise Congress of the degree to which the Soviet Union and other East European countries were in compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki accords on European security and cooperation. **********The Soviet record on human rights was described as varied, with deterioration in some areas and progress in others, according to the State Department. **********''On the positive side, emigration continued to rise although it remained restricted almost exclusively to Armenians, German and Jews,'' it said. **********In addition, Soviet limits on what could be printed continued to expand, the report said, citing the publication of such books as Boris Pasternak's ''Doctor Zhivago'' and George Orwell's ''Animal Farm.'' Estimate on Prisoners **********On the negative side, the report noted that ''many political and religious prisoners remained incarcerated or in internal exile.'' It quoted estimates of the number of political and religious prisoners ranging from 250 to 450. **********In addition, Soviet authorities adopted a harsh attitude toward demonstrations deemed anti-Government and sometimes disconnected the telephones of opponents in an effort to disrupt their activities, the report said. Domestically, the changes under way within the Soviet Union improved the ability of citzens to express their views both in official media and unofficial publications and organizations, the report said. At the same time, there was a ''general absence'' of house searches and political arrests in Moscow and Leningrad, although such searches continued in the Baltic republics and the Ukraine. **********The report noted ''significant improvements'' in Soviet policy toward family reunification. Many Jews who had been refused permission to emigrate were granted exit visas. **********The report also cited progress in the cases of divided families and a liberalization of travel policies applying both to Soviet citizens who wish to go outside the country and to Soviet emigres who were permitted to return to visit relatives. **********The document sounded a skeptical note in discussing the rapid changes in the Soviet Union's more tolerant approach to information. ''While a new positive trend thus has continued, it is the result of political calculation and is controlled by the leadership,'' the report said. ''Information has become an important weapon which the new reformist leadership is wielding against its political opposition.'' **********In Poland, the report said, authorities continued to restrict most forms of political or union activity. The Government banned an independent discussion club in Gdansk that sought registration under Polish law. However, the report concluded that despite restrictions on political acitivity, the Polish Government permits ''a relatively free intellectual life within certain limits.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/05/business/company-news-american-standard.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Standard", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; American Standard", "body_text": " **********Finmeccanica Societa Finanziaria Meccanica S.p.A. said a subsidiary, Ansaldo S.p.A., had agreed to acquire the railway signaling operations of American Standard Inc.

Although trade unionists and other protesters have greater freedom to organize than they did in the past, men in uniform still exercise ultimate political authority. **********The army put down an attempted coup in May, but in so doing it underlined the extent to which President Vinicio Cerezo depends on military support. Politicians, people in business and labor leaders say the Government is not fully stable, and they express concern about the future. **********In a recent interview, Mr. Cerezo said he sensed no imminent threat to his Government. He conceded, however, that popular discontent was rising, and he did not discount the possibility of future attempts to depose him. Plotting for Coup Seen **********''I can't deny that right-wing parties are working to create conditions for a coup,'' Mr. Cerezo said. ''They are trying to persuade army officers to join them. But for now, they are not having any success.'' **********Mr. Cerezo has introduced economic austerity measures that have provoked strikes and other protests. Such protests would have been impossible under past military regimes, when opposition leaders were systematically abducted and killed. Even so, the curse of violence that has dominated Guatemalan life for more than 30 years has not been fully lifted. **********People are shot in the streets almost every day, and bodies bearing signs of torture are regularly discovered on roadsides. No one believes that senior Government officials still draw up lists of people to be killed, which they did as recently as the early 1980's. But there is debate about who is behind today's violence. Common Criminals Blamed **********The newly appointed Interior Minister, Roberto Valle Valdizon, insisted in an interview that common criminals were responsible for most assaults on Guatemalans. **********''There has been a radical change in the origin of violence in Guatemala,'' Mr. Valle said. ''I won't say there is no such thing as political violence anymore, because extremist groups still do exist. But the great majority of what we are seeing is the work of the kind of delinquents that are part of every society.'' **********Not all Guatemalans agree with Mr. Valle's assessment. Officers who in the past were tied to urban death squads and military units that carried out massacres of peasants still hold second-level posts in the army, the National Police and the Treasury Police. Their presence reflects Mr. Cerezo's failure or inability to rid the armed forces of people who directed repression under previous governments. **********In the countryside, military officers still put pressure on peasants to take part in ''civilian patrols'' aimed at controlling the Marxist guerrilla insurgency. The guerrillas are not believed to number more than 1,000, and the new Constitution says civilian patrols are strictly voluntary. But peasants say army officers press them heavily to maintain the patrols. **********More than 100,000 Guatemalans, nearly all of them Indians, are living in refugee camps across the northern border with Mexico, where they fled in the early 1980's to escape an army counterinsurgency campaign. Senior military officers say they suspect that the refugees sympathize with guerrillas, and that as a result the large majority have chosen to stay in the camps rather than return to Guatemala. **********The combination of social conflicts, perceived political instability, continuing violence and increasing allegations of official corruption has led to a palpable decline in Mr. Cerezo's popularity and, among some groups, disillusionment with democracy in this country of 8.6 million people. **********According to Edgar Heinemann, who heads the country's principal business coalition, Guatemalans brought $250 million back into the country in the first six months of 1987, when Mr. Cerezo's Government appeared on its way to creating a peaceful society. But he said that the process was now reversed, and that in the first half of 1988, no new money was repatriated and about $40 million was sent abroad. **********''People aren't worried that there is going to be some disaster tomorrow, but there is fear about what may lie further ahead,'' Mr. Heinemann said. 'Situation Very Changed' **********After Mr. Cerezo took office in January 1986, he named a former Foreign Minister, Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, as his Ambassador to the United Nations. This month, Mr. Andrade left his post and returned to Guatemala, where he is laying the groundwork for a possible presidential campaign. At his law office on a tree-shaded avenue, he said he was alarmed at what he found upon his return. **********''I find the situation very changed,'' Mr. Andrade said. ''When I left two and a half years ago, this was a country full of hope and enthusiasm, with a desire to develop and realize its potential. **********''Now I find Guatemala in a deep political, social and economic crisis. Fundamentally it is a crisis of confidence. The situation is very worrisome, and the stability of the Government is in danger. Even in human rights, there has been great improvement, but there are disturbing signs that political violence is increasing again.'' **********Although the United States has had diplomatic differences with Mr. Cerezo's Government on issues related to Central America, American officials say they still support him. The United States recently increased both economic and military aid to Guatemala, bringing the total to more than $150 million, according to official figures. Threats in Calls and Letters **********In Santa Cruz del Quiche, at the edge of the lush Guatemalan highlands, Amilcar Mendez Urizar, a schoolteacher and peasant organizer, says he has powerful and frightening enemies. **********When he leaves his home to travel to Indian villages, he is often followed by an army jeep with darkened windows. After he returns home, he receives anonymous telephone calls advising him to make funeral arrangements. **********In a manila folder, Mr. Mendez saves the threatening letters he receives. ''The best thing you can do is to leave the country or give up your perverse aims forever, dear Communist teacher,'' says the most recent one, dated May 28. ''Otherwise you and your family will be executed.'' **********Mr. Mendez, who survived an ambush in 1980 and an army kidnapping in 1983, has fled into exile twice, but is determined not to leave again. **********''I feel deceived by what was supposed to be a new regime of democracy,'' he said one recent morning. ''Out here in the countryside, the military is in control. They think human rights work is a smokescreen for Communism and subversion.'' Polarization Continues **********Political polarization has characterized Guatemala for years, and political life is still defined by the lines that were drawn in 1954, when a 10-year experiment with democracy ended after an American-backed coup. Today, while labor and peasant groups organize to demand better working conditions, many wealthy landowners and politicians strongly resist change. They view even Mr. Cerezo's willingness to negotiate with such groups as a concession to incipient socialism. **********''In the army as well as in civilian society, there are people who think this Government is leading the country toward Communism,'' said Edmond Mulet, a prominent opposition congressman. ''They think the guerrillas are infiltrating unions, peasant groups, political parties and the universities, and they think this has to be stopped. That's why political violence is coming back, I'm afraid.'' **********''I have heard high-ranking army officers say that the only way to resolve this situation is with a bullet for the President,'' Mr. Mulet said. **********Mr. Cerezo has repeatedly said he will not accept any form of ''constitutionalist'' coup, in which he would resign in favor of the Vice President or other official. He often says the only way he will leave the presidential palace is ''feet first.'' He wears a pistol at all times, even at work in his office. **********''And I know how to use it,'' he told a visitor recently, without any hint of a smile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/11/business/company-news-southdown-lifts-offer-to-moore-mccormack.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Belkin", "pub_date": "1988-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Southdown Lifts Offer To Moore McCormack", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Southdown Lifts Offer To Moore McCormack", "body_text": " **********Southdown Inc., the Houston-based cement manufacturer, increased its bid for Moore McCormack Resources Inc., the Stamford, Conn., cement manufacturer, to $35 a common share from $31 a share, raising the total value of the deal to $450 million. **********The increased offer came a day after Southdown announced it was seeking written consent from Moore McCormack stockholders to remove the company's ''poison pill'' and other defensive provisions. **********''A combination of Moore McCormack and Southdown makes tremendous sense by a variety of quantitative standards,'' a spokesman for Southdown said.

The company may bring $12 million or more. **********Whoever buys Birchtree will have rights to ''Happy Birthday,'' which brings in about $1 million a year, only until 2010, when the song's 75-year copyright expires and it becomes part of the public domain. **********The song was written by Patty Smith Hill and her sister Mildred J. Hill, two kindergarten and Sunday school teachers in Louisville, Ky. **********In 1893 the sisters wrote a book called ''Song Stories for the Sunday School.'' Within that book was a composition called ''Good Morning to All,'' which had the ''Happy Birthday'' melody. The lyrics went: ''Good morning to you, good morning to you, good morning dear children, good morning to all.'' Sung in Many Languages **********Only later did the sisters add the birthday words. It is now one of the three most popular songs in the English language, the Guinness Book of World Records says, along with ''Auld Lang Syne'' and ''For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.'' The song is sung in many languages, from Spanish, Dutch, Italian and Swedish to Malaysian and Ewe (an African language). **********''I think it was the movies that did it,'' said David Sengstack, Birchtree's chairman, when asked to account for its worldwide popularity. **********The song came into the possession of the Sengstack family when John F. Sengstack, a New York accountant, bought the Clayton F. Summy Company, a Chicago sheet-music retailer that published the Hill sisters' work. The song was not copyrighted until 1935, however - the same year that Summy joined the American Society of Composers and Publishers, which monitors songs played in public and on radio and television. **********Because the copyright was registered by the company, not the sisters, the song is considered a ''work for hire,'' and thus under current law is entitled to copyright protection for 75 years. **********The Sengstacks expanded the company in the educational music field, renaming it Birchtree Ltd. in the 1970's. David Sengstack said that about 1,700 of the company's 50,000 titles are actively used. Birchtree owns two other familiar properties: the Suzuki Method, an instrumental instruction method for violin, cello and viola, and the Francis Clark library for piano students. Birchtree has worldwide rights to the Francis Clark Library and has worldwide rights, except for Japan, to the Suzuki Method. Teaching manuals of those two methods bring in about $2 million a year. Peculiar Situations **********Enforcing the copyright of a song as popular as ''Happy Birthday'' has led to some peculiar situations. By law, any public performance of the song for profit or mechanical reproduction triggers a copyright fee. Summy sued Postal Telegraph in the 1940's when the song was used in singing telegrams. The suit was dropped when company lawyers were stymied by the argument that even though the song was used for profit, it was not sung in public. **********The company also objected when Frederick's of Hollywood advertised underwear that played ''Happy Birthday.'' **********Casio digital watches that can be programmed to play the birthday song every hour on the owner's birthday bring Birchtree a penny a watch. **********The song was used in the films ''10,'' ''The Great Santini,'' ''Oh God'' and ''Fame,'' and royalties were paid. But when it was used in ''The Gin Game,'' a Broadway show with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, the song was not originally credited in the program. Its owners sent a letter, and the producers paid $25 a performance for the remainder of the run. **********Collecting the fees, like protecting the copyright, is a complicated process. All royalties from public and broadcast performances are collected by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. If the song is used in a record, tape, film or television commercial, a second organization, the Harry Fox Agency, collects fees. **********If it is sung in a Broadway show, the publisher collects directly. 'No One Is Recording the Song' **********The Hill Foundation, established by the Hill sisters for their heirs, gets the author's share of the gross revenues from the song. **********The fees are not higher because ''no one is really recording the song anymore,'' said Steven Oaks, an investment banker at Wertheim Schroder & Company, which is handling the sale. And few people buy records and sheet music of the song. **********Music publishers are generally sold for 4 to 10 times annual cash flow. By that formula, Birchtree could sell for $12 million or more. Wertheim began providing financial data on the company to prospective buyers last week. **********Mr. Sengstack said that many large companies that own music publishing operations, like Warner Communications and EMI, have worldwide organizations to monitor and protect copyrights and market them. ''We are a small educational company and are in no position to operate on that scale,'' Mr. Sengstack said. He said that his children had no interest in taking over the company, although they have worked there at various times."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/a-seabrook-owner-sets-rate-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 935, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Seabrook Owner Sets Rate Plan", "print_headline": "A Seabrook Owner Sets Rate Plan", "body_text": " **********The Public Service Company of New Hampshire filed a reorganization plan in Federal bankruptcy court yesterday that would enable the utility to charge its ratepayers for its stake in the stalled Seabrook nuclear plant. **********Under the plan, Public Service would establish a holding company regulated by the Federal Government. That arrangement would circumvent a state law that bars utilities from charging ratepayers for the cost of a plant before the plant is operating. **********Public Service said it would seek increases of 30 to 40 percent over the next five years. **********Governor-elect Judd Gregg and other state officials said the utility was trying to satisfy its creditors' demands at the expense of ratepayers. They vowed to oppose the plan. 9 Months After Filing The presentation of the plan came nine months after the company became the first investor-owned utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the Depression. Officials said the reorganization plan represented another step in solving the utility's financial woes. **********The financial adviser to the company's equity holders committee said he would file a suit against the reorganization plan. **********''We are opposed to the plan and we will litigate it,'' said Wilbur Ross, managing director of Rothschild Inc. ''The plan provides for the unsecured creditors to get 100 cents on the dollar if Seabrook does not operate and then to capture roughly 50 percent of the upside if Seabrook does operate. The plan has the clear potential of giving creditors more than they are legally entitled to.'' No Agreement Reached **********Public Service officials and state negotiators have been discussing a possible rate increase for several months but have failed to reach an agreement. **********''While we might prefer an agreement to achieve those goals, we have not made sufficient progress in negotiations with the state,'' said John C. Duffett, president of Public Service. ''We will pursue approval of this plan while we continue discussions with all parties.'' **********Operating under Federal regulation would enable the utility to begin charging its 360,000 ratepayers for the company's 36 percent share in the $5.7 billion Seabrook nuclear plant. **********The reorganization plan calls for secured creditors to receive 100 cents on the dollar in new bonds carrying an 11.15 percent interest rate. Unsecured ceditors would get a combination of new debentures with a 10.75 percent interest rate, all of the preferred stock and 55 percent of the common stock in the reorganized company. They would not receive unpaid back interest. **********Preferred shareholders would receive 27 percent of the common stock and the stake of holders of common stock would would be diluted to 18 percent. The reorganized company would have $1.1 billion in debt, well below the current level of $1.5 billion. **********The proposed reorganization would create a holding company with three subsidiaries, one to transmit electricity, another to handle retail distribution and the third to provide support services. Stock Drops $1.625, to $4.25 **********On the New York Stock Exchange, the utility's stock was down $1.625, closing at $4.25. **********''The negotiation process does not end with the filing of this plan,'' said Charles E. Bayless, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the company. ''It only enters a new phase.'' **********The utility company had until yesterday to file a reorganization plan in the bankruptcy court, in Manchester, N.H. The filing automatically extends for two months its exclusive right to file a reorganization plan. Had it not filed, the court would have allowed other parties to put forward their own reorganizaion proposals. **********Public Service holds a 35 percent stake in Seabrook, with the balance held by 11 other utility companies in New England. Without the Seabrook plant, which represents two-thirds of the assets of Public Service, Public Service of New Hampshire is highly profitable. The nuclear plant was completed more than two years ago but has never opened. **********Last week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Public Service was qualified to receive a license to test it at low power, perhaps by next month, despite its bankruptcy filing. Emergency-Planning Dispute **********The plant's operations have been delayed for years in a dispute over emergency planning with the state of Massachusetts, whose northern border lies two miles from the plant. **********Turning aside an appeal by Seabrook opponents, the commission voted unanimously not to consider the bankruptcy when it makes its final determination of whether the plant can have a low-power license. That would allow testing at 5 percent of maximum power. **********Mr. Bayless said the company had spent more than $2 billion in capital costs on Seabrook in the last 15 years. ''We have spent all that money and we're not earning anything on those assets and we can't keep that up very long,'' he said. **********Mr. Bayless said the Seabrook project ''is making steady progress through the licensing process and could have an unconditional low-power license within days.'' However, he added that ''commercial operation is still a number of months away.'' **********In recent months, four utility companies in New England have indicated that they are interested in acquiring parts of Public Service's assets other than Seabrook. **********The company must now win approval of its reorganization plan from the various parties involved and present that plan to the Federal bankruptcy court for approval."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/10/business/week-in-business-the-dollar-s-up-with-some-help.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Dodson", "pub_date": "1988-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 977, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Dollar's Up, With Some Help", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; The Dollar's Up, With Some Help", "body_text": " **********The dollar got strong support from central bankers in both words and deeds.

A 140-point dive for the day in the Dow Jones industrial average, a 6.9 percent loss, was the third-biggest point decline ever.

Also cited were rumors that figures due out next Friday would show a large widening of the trade deficit. And traders were uneasy about the recommendations of the Presidential commission studying the market's October plunge. Before Friday, the Dow had four up days, but it ended the week at 1,911.30, off 27.53 points. *********** Radical changes in the trading of securities were proposed by the Presidential commission looking into the market collapse. The recommendations include putting some limits on price swings; more centralization of regulatory authority over financial markets, with the Federal Reserve being given a much broader role, and making all types of securities subject to a single set of rules on the use of borrowed money to make investments. The commission was headed by Nicholas F. Brady, pictured, the chairman of Dillon Read. Neither Wall Street nor the White House seemed very enthusiastic about most of the recommendations. *********** A $4.2 billion bid for Sterling Drug was made by Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland. Sterling makes Bayer aspirin, Milk of Magnesia and a number of other over-the-counter medicines. Hoffmann-La Roche's best-known product is the tranquilizer Valium. The all-cash offer was not especially welcome at Sterling. *********** Retailers' December sales got a lift from last-minute holiday shoppers and after-Christmas promotions. Still, the season as a whole was far from robust. Sears said its December sales were up 4.9 percent, compared with December 1986, and most other chains had gains that were, at best, only a few percentage points more than that. *********** The unemployment rate fell in December, to 5.7 percent, from 5.8 percent in November. The current rate is the lowest of the 1980's. Manufacturing has been the boom area for jobs, with more than 400,000 workers added in 1987. Employment in the retail and financial services sectors was unchanged in December. *********** The Big Board's largest specialist gave up the right to make a market in J. P. Morgan shares, after holding ''discussions'' with exchange officials about its handling of the stock during the October market collapse. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg was the first firm to face such a sanction from the events of October but similar moves against a number of others are expected. **********Pillsbury is trimming its restaurant operations. The company, which is best known for packaged foods, will close or sell 103 restaurants, including 43 Burger King and Godfather's Pizza outlets. Pillsbury is giving up on its Quick Wok, Bay Street and Key West Grill chains, which total about 30 restaurants. The 30 other outlets to be shed are expected to come mostly from the Steak and Ale chain. **********General Mills would like to sell its Talbots and Eddie Bauer retail operations, the only non-food units that it has left from a series of acquisitions made in the 1960's and 1970's. *********** Saudi Arabia backed off a days-old plan to impose an income tax on foreign workers. Many of the workers threatened to leave the country if the Saudi Government went ahead with its plan, which called for taxes of up to 30 percent on individuals. But an income tax of as much as 45 percent on foreign companies apparently will take effect later this month. *********** Detroit had its fourth-best year ever in 1987, selling 15.1 million units, down significantly from 1986's record sales of 16.3 million. Of the Big Three, only Ford beat its 1986 results with a 1.6 percent gain, to 3.46 million vehicles. General Motors sales were down 16.3 percent and Chrysler had a drop of 8.1 percent. *********** T. Boone Pickens will provide the final $150 million that Paul A. Bilzerian needs for a $1 billion hostile takeover of Singer. A Pickens group will lend the money to Mr. Bilzerian at an interest rate of 17.5 percent and it will also collect some $3 million in fees. In addition, it will get 20 percent of the profit Mr. Bilzerian receives from selling any Singer assets. *********** The world's largest honky-tonk is closing, another victim of hard times in Texas. Billy Bob's Texas in Fort Worth, a 100,000-square-foot club that featured top-name country music and live rodeo, had opened in 1981, the heyday of the urban cowboy. *********** Miscellanea. Austin, Tex., was chosen as the headquarters for a computer chip research project set up by a consortium of 14 companies . . . A.T.& T. will take a stake of up to 20 percent in Sun Microsystems, a manufacturer of computer work stations for engineers and scientists . . .

Debt Level Has Risen **********William Wetreich, a vice president at Standard & Poor's, said that the action was taken because Pepperell is still integrating the operations obtained from the $1.2 billion acquisition of J. P. Stevens Inc. by Pepperell and two other partners six months ago. Mr. Wetreich said that the Stevens acquisition had strengthened Pepperell's position in towels and sheets, but that it had raised the company's debt to nearly $1 billion. **********He added that Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its single-B senior debt rating for Farley. ''Even though management continues its aggressive investment strategy, Farley's cash pool, coupled with expected asset sales, should reduce the financial impact of this deal,'' a statement by Standard & Poor's said. Bid Seen as Low **********Pepperell, which manufactures Arrow shirts and Martex towels, did not comment beyond a two-sentence statement. A company spokeswoman also declined to comment on the action by Standard & Poor's. **********Some analysts said that they considered the $48-a-share bid too low, adding that the company is worth more than $50 a share. ''I think it's worth something in the $55 range,'' said Grace Taferner, an analyst with the First Manhattan Company. **********Some analysts said the proposed acquisition by Farley, which is believed to own 9.8 percent of Pepperell, was intended to take advantage of current Federal antitrust policies before a new administration takes office. They pointed out that even though Farley, which makes Fruit of the Loom and BVD underwear, is not in the textile business, potential acquirers of Pepperell operations -many of which could be placed for sale by Farley - could encounter antitrust problems. 'A Lot of Parties Interested' **********''The breakup value of Pepperrell is clearly worth more than keeping the company intact,'' Ms. Taferner said. ''Farley wants the bed and bath business, which is the jewel of the company. And there are a lot of parties interested in the businesses Farley doesn't want to hold onto.'' **********In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Farley said it would sell Pepperell's apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics business if its bid was successful. The company also said it would keep Pepperell's household fabrics business. **********Farley, one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, made its offer subject to elimination of Pepperell's ''poison-pill'' measures, which are intended to discourage a hostile takeover, and to the nullificaton of a Georgia law that would prevent Farley from completing a merger for five years if it won control of West Point-Pepperell.

Prudential-Bache Capital Funding was looking for new public financing techniques after tax-law changes severely restricted the use of tax-free industrial development bonds. Los Angeles County was seeking ways to keep entertainment industry jobs in the region. **********Out of those diverse needs came an innovative plan to issue taxable municipal bonds, in the name of a county-sponsored agency, as a means of raising funds for bargain-rate bank loans to film producers. The initial bond issue, for $47 million, was completed earlier this month, and the first loan was issued to Thom Mount, an independent producer who is making a movie called ''Tequila Sunrise'' for Warner Brothers, a unit of Warner Communications. **********All the parties say they came out winners. Tokai Bank has used the process to gain a foothold in a very competitive loan market and has done so in a way that it hopes will help increase its return on assets. Prudential-Bache has a new product that it believes can be used by other municipalities to foster growth in virtually any industry. Los Angeles County feels it has fulfilled a pledge to support the entertainment business at a time when other regions are aggressively seeking to attract film production. And Mr. Mount said the terms of his $20 million loan could save him $500,000 in interest payments and fees over traditional bank financing. **********''That's serious money to us,'' Mr. Mount said. ''It's safe to say I'm very enthusiastic.'' The program is the brainchild of Carol Wakefield, who joined the Tokai Bank a year ago to build its entertainment-lending business; Douglas R. Weld, who handles real estate lending for Tokai, and William E. Straw, a first vice president at Prudential-Bache. **********This is how the plan works: Prudential-Bache issues taxable municipal bonds, actually commercial paper, under the name of the Economic Development Corporation and Community Development Commission, both of which are nonprofit agencies established by Los Angeles County. The paper is backed by a letter of credit from Tokai, giving it the commercial paper equivalent of a AAA credit rating. The county and its agencies bear no financial obligation for the paper. **********In return for associating itself with the plan, however, the county receives a fee of one-tenth of 1 percent of the amount raised. The low interest rate on the taxable municipal paper allows the bank to keep its cost of funds down and charge its loan customers a rate lower than that on a traditional commercial bank loan. **********''We can provide them with access to a capital market normally reserved for those borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Mr. Straw said. ''It's not as good a deal as a tax-exempt industrial development bond, but it's a better rate than commercial bank financing.'' **********Another advantage, Ms. Wakefield said, is that the borrower can lock in the interest rate for up to nine months, providing more financial stability than the floating rate typical of most bank loans. For the initial loans, the commercial paper was sold at an effective annual interest rate of 6.9 percent and the rate to the borrower for nine months was 8.5 percent, about half a percentage point lower than a typical bank financing deal for the same type of film project, she said. **********The structure of the deal is particularly attractive to the Tokai Bank of California, which has about $1 billion in assets. Because the funds for the loans are generated by the use of a letter of credit, the income from the loan is technically a fee rather than interest, Ms. Wakefield said. Therefore, the deal does not have to be booked as a loan on the balance sheet. The net effect is to increase the return on the institution's assets, an area where Tokai, like most Japanese banks, has lagged. **********Ms. Wakefield said the California bank hoped to generate $200 million to $350 million in financing for similar deals for movie producers this year. Mr. Straw of Prudential-Bache said the technique would not be limited to the entertainment industry. The investment banking company continues to explore use of the technique to finance real estate development, both in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere, and might seek other uses as well. **********One potentially troublesome twist to the plan is that the county agencies involved review the film proposals to help decide which producers will get financing. Some in the industry wonder whether that comes perilously close to giving the government censorship power. But those involved in the plan dismiss such fears, saying that the agencies do not review scripts and that all lending arrangements in the industry involve a review of a movie's commercial viability."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/12/business/bonn-sets-credit-line-for-soviets.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Farr", "pub_date": "1988-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn Sets Credit Line For Soviets", "print_headline": "Bonn Sets Credit Line For Soviets", "body_text": " **********West German bankers have completed arrangements for the largest Western credit line ever to the Soviet Union - a package worth $1.6 billion to help Moscow modernize its food and consumer goods industries. **********The credit arrangement comes at a crucial time for the Soviet Union.

Unlike the West German Government, Washington has been less than enthusiastic about private bank lending to the Soviet Union. **********The limited about of American loans to Moscow dried up after the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan and resumed only cautiously after Mr. Gorbachev took office. A five-year hiatus in American lending to the Russians ended in 1985. **********On the other hand, close trading and banking links between the Soviet Union and West Germany were developed in the 1970's, particularly by Deutsche Bank. **********West German bankers and politicians are generally enthusiastic about perestroika and the opportunities it offers. They are quick to reject warnings, especially from the United States, that enhanced economic links between Moscow and Western Europe could present a Soviet threat to the Western alliance. **********Mr. Kohl has condemned such a view as ''a philosophy from the cold war,'' and his Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has been a leading advocate of ''taking Gorbachev at his word and supporting perestroika.'' **********West German experts see increased Soviet indebtedness as a stabilizing factor, not a threat. **********''There is no political danger,'' said Heinrich Machovski, an expert on the Soviet Union at the German Institute for Economic Rersearch.

Noriega Seen as the Leader **********Most Panamanians seemed to acknowledge that General Noriega, who was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States this month, remained the most powerful person in the country. **********Eric Arturo Delvalle, who as President tried to remove General Noriega on Thursday, was himself removed by the National Assembly in an early morning session today. He remained in his house today, receiving friends and diplomats and contending that he was still President. **********In Washington, the Reagan Administration said it fully supported Mr. Delvalle but had no plans for military intervention.  [ Page 5. ]  A Political Counterattack General Noriega, after refusing to step down Thursday night, counterattacked politically. Most military commanders pledged to support him, and he controls the National Assembly. **********After voting to remove President Delvalle and Vice President Roderick Esquivel, the Assembly installed the Minister of Education, Manuel Solis Palma, as President, the country's sixth in seven years. **********Mr. Delvalle, speaking from his home, denounced the Assembly's action as unconstitutional. He called for a general strike and appealed to other countries to suspend trade with Panama and to refrain from recognizing the new President. He said he would not support American military intervention. Delvalle Meets U.S. Envoy **********Soldiers were posted near Mr. Delvalle's home, but they did not try to enter. Mr. Delvalle spent several hours during the night with the United States Ambassador, Arthur H. Davis, and today he received other ambassadors and prominent Panamanians. **********''It seems to us that we should give our support to President Delvalle,'' said Archbishop Marcos McGrath, the Roman Catholic Primate of Panama. **********Business and commerce were normal today, but opposition leaders met to consider plans for possible protests next week. Anti-Noriega demonstrators who began to gather on Thursday night were dispersed by riot police, and troops were posted today in areas where there have been confrontations in the past. **********A column of Noriega backers, some shouting anti-American slogans, drove through several parts of the capital at midday. At military command headquarters, they were briefly greeted by General Noriega. He reportedly spent much of the day meeting with the new President. **********In interviews on the streets today, several Panamanians said they were not surprised that General Noriega had defied Mr. Delvalle. But opposition leaders said the general's decision to remove yet another President would further damage his image abroad. In September 1985, General Noriega and other military leaders forced out President Nicolas Ardito Barletta and replaced him with Vice President Delvalle. **********''Finally, everyone knows and the world recognizes that we do not have a democratic system or a civilian Government here,'' said Ruben Dario Carles, a leading critic of the military. ''The domestic and foreign pressures on the regime are becoming quite strong. I think we've advanced a lot.'' **********A Latin American diplomat, however, said the confrontation should be considered a victory for General Noriega. ''It's all over, and now Noriega is stronger than ever,'' the diplomat said. U.S. Cautions Soldiers **********United States military authorities today advised the estimated 10,000 American soldiers based here to ''reduce your visibility.'' **********''Some disturbance activity is likely,'' announcers on American military stations warned. **********The principal anti-Noriega newspaper, La Prensa, was ordered shut Thursday night, as was a television station owned by Mr. Delvalle's family. **********After the National Assembly voted to remove Mr. Delvalle, he told reporters he still considered himself president. In Washington, officials said they recognize Mr. Delvalle's legitimacy. **********Mr. Delvalle tried to bolster his position by appointing his supporters, including members of the opposition, to key positions. He named Gabriel Lewis Galindo, former ambassador to the United States and an opposition leader in Washington, as roving ambassador. And he appointed Jose I. Blandon, a former close aide to General Noriega, as Ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Blandon testified recently against the general before a Florida grand jury and a Senate subcommittee. **********Mr. Delvalle said he would keep Panama's Ambassador to the United States, Juan Sosa, in his position after Mr. Sosa announced his support for Mr. Delvalle. Friendship With U.S. Deteriorates **********Until last year, the United States enjoyed a close friendship with the Panamanian military. But relations became strained after reports linked General Noriega to drug trafficking and other crimes. **********This month, General Noriega was indicted by two Federal grand juries in Florida on charges of racketeering and drug trafficking. **********General Noriega and his associates have asserted that Washington is directing a campaign of slander against him and Panama. The Assembly resolution removing Mr. Delvalle from the Presidency asserted that he was supporting ''the intervention of the United States Government in Panama's internal affairs.'' **********Mr. Delvalle is a wealthy sugar farmer and breeder of race horses. Friends and political allies had been urging him for months to take a stand against General Noriega, and apparently the indictments in Florida drove him to act. **********During a trip to the United States this month, Mr. Delvalle met with American officials. Friends said today that those meetings apparently encouraged him to break with the general. **********This week's events, however, suggested no shift in the balance of power in Panama, which is heavily weighted in favor of the military. **********When Mr. Delvalle announced he was removing General Noriega, he named the military chief of staff, Colonel Marcos Justines, as the new commander. But Colonel Justines rejected the post, and he and other senior officers declared their complete support for General Noriega.  PRESIDENT VS.

India Was 'in the Market' **********Gary Milhollin, an expert at the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said today that circumstantial evidence suggested that the heavy water might have been diverted to India. He said that India ''was in the market'' for heavy water at the time of the diversion and that other press reports have recounted tales of covert shipments to India. **********Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, can be a key ingredient in a series of steps to make nuclear weapons. Consequently, its export is tightly controlled. **********The material is used to allow nuclear reactors to run on natural uranium, which is widely available, rather than on enriched uranium fuel, which is scarce and tightly controlled. A byproduct of nuclear reactions is plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. According to experts, the quantity of missing heavy water, slightly more than 15 tons, is substantial. The International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, says 20 tons of heavy water is a ''significant'' amount, and one American expert said 20 tons would be enough to operate a reactor for a year and produce enough plutonium to conduct a single nuclear explosion. **********There have been extensive reports in the Norwegian press that a substantial supply of Norwegian heavy water was diverted in December 1983 to unknown destinations. Today, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry confirmed the essence of these reports. The spokesman said the Oslo Government and the company that sold the heavy water did not know that the water had failed to reach its intended destination in West Germany until press reports appeared in Germany and Norway. **********American officials said they were not aware of any diversion until the press reports. **********According to Mr. Seim, Norway sold 15.18 tons of heavy water in 1983 to a West German company, Rohstoff Einfuhr. Proper export licenses were prepared and the material was brought to the airport at Oslo, where it was to be flown to Frankfurt by a plane operated by West African Airlines. **********At the last minute, the pilot filed a new flight plan. Instead of flying to Frankfurt, the plane flew to Basel, Switzerland, the spokesman said. The heavy water was then shipped to an unknown destination. **********''We have no information on where the heavy water eventually landed,'' Mr. Seim said. Norwegian press reports have speculated that the heavy water may have found its way to India or Pakistan. **********India, which exploded a nuclear device in May 1974, has several reactors that use heavy water and are not under international safeguards. India produces heavy water, but some experts say India does not make enough to satisfy its needs. If India were to openly import heavy water, it would be obliged to subject the substance to international safeguards. **********The Norwegian spokesman said Norway had asked West Germany to investigate the diversion. **********Norwegian press reports have said the West German company that purchased the heavy water was run by Alfred Hempel. American officials said Mr. Hempel has long been a source of concern to the United States because of his involvement in the heavy water trade. An American Government specialist said he is believed to have sold heavy water to India in the past. **********The disclosure of the diversion is the second recent controversy involving shipments of Norwegian heavy water. **********Experts have charged that Israel has used heavy water that Norway sold for peaceful purposes to manufacture nuclear weapons at its reactor at Dimona. The two nations are trying to negotiate an agreement for inspection of heavy water in Israel. **********Also, an arms company owned by the Norwegian Government, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, was involved in a scandal in which advanced submarine propeller milling equipment was sent by the Japanese company Toshiba to the Soviet Union, violating Western export rules. **********In the case of the 1983 shipment of heavy water, the Norwegian spokesman said the Government and the Norwegian company that sold it, Norsk Hydro, had been unaware of the diversion and had acted properly. **********Mr. Seim also said airport procedures had been tightened in recent years so a similar diversion would not be possible today.

''There was concern about economic uncertainty.'' **********While that concern still exists - witness the recent paralysis of the Dow Jones industrial average - gold sales have fallen off, presumably because much of the money freed by investors selling late last year has already found a home. **********But in Wall Street's post-collapse world, more and more investment advisers - including some sophisticated portfolio managers - are urging clients to put at least a portion, perhaps 5 to 10 percent, of their assets in gold. **********Not everyone believes that gold and other precious metals have a place in the typical portfolio. Some economists argue that society and the world's financial structure are evolving away from historical measures of wealth. They see a future in which hard currencies, like gold, will give way to electronic credits. **********But others believe that people will always need something tangible to trade. Ms. Ziemian notes that gold ''is a universally agreed-upon way of transferring wealth among nations.'' And the real pessimists among the ''gold bugs'' argue that, regardless of what currencies may evolve, after the mushroom clouds dissipate, people will want some gold clinking in their pockets. **********Armageddon scenarios aside, buying gold - and silver and platinum - is easy. But being taken advantage of is also easy. For example, in recent months there has been a spate of advertisements, in newspapers and on television, for the new American Gold and Silver Eagle coins in which the prices, particularly for the Silver Eagles, are exorbitantly high. **********Some ads play on the fear generated by the stock market's collapse. In some cases, they are so misleadingly structured as to convey the impression that the seller has some connection to the Government or the United States Mint. The disclaimer to the contrary is in print small enough to be etched on a real coin. **********Even the quotes offered by small coin shops in the New York area vary widely, with some shops asking $20 to $40 for a single 1986 Silver Eagle, when a fair price, as quoted by large dealers, such at Manfra, Tordella & Brookes, is more in the $12-to-$14 range. And around the year-end holidays, even large retailers are not above offering such coins in a cute gift box for $25. **********Serious investors, as opposed to those who buy coins to give their grandchildren at Christmas, usually try to buy gold and silver as near to spot price as possible. **********For gold, they can go to a bank, brokerage house or precious metals dealer and order the metal in 10- and 100-ounce bars. Phone and mail orders are acceptable, with buyers paying by check or credit card. Customers can take possession of the bars, or the seller can store the metal. **********The costs vary, but competitive factors will keep prices in a narrow range among the major outlets. Citibank, for example, charges $7.50 an ounce over spot for a 10-ounce gold bar. That means that at a $438 spot, plus the premium, a 10-ounce bar would cost $4,455. Ms. Ziemian at Citibank said there was no extra charge for the 100-ounce bar, which would cost $43,800, with Citibank making some money on the natural spread between what it pays for the gold and the spot price. **********Buyers of silver bullion would pay 75 cents an ounce over a spot price of $6.30 for a 10-ounce bar, and a 60-cent premium an ounce on a 100-ounce bar. Buyers of a 1,000-ounce bar pay only spot. **********Citibank also sells gold and silver in dollar amounts. The minimum purchase is $100 (which buys a portion of an ounce of gold or several ounces of silver), and Citibank stores the metals for customers, who get a statement showing their position. Citibank customers can ''dollar cost average'' their purchases by arranging to have automatic deductions from their bank accounts. Non-customers can have automatic deductions from Visa or Mastercard. **********Brokerage houses offer similar accumulation plans, and for platinum as well. Banks cannot sell platinum except in the Noble coin, which is legal tender. Since the banks or brokerages that offer such plans pool customers' money and buy in bulk, investors get a price just over spot. **********Citibank and others also sell gold coins, such as the American Eagle, the Canadian Maple Leaf and the Australian Nugget. Those coins now all sell in the same rough range. A one-ounce Gold Eagle sells for about $463, a 6.5 percent, or $25, premium over a $438 spot. Eagles also come in 1/10-, 1/4- and 1/2-ounce sizes, but the premiums are much greater for the smaller coins. **********A one-ounce coin such as China's Panda costs perhaps 9 percent more than an Eagle, because of the Panda's yearly design changes, which increase its numismatic value. **********American Silver Eagles may sell for $8.30 a coin, with about a 30 percent premium over silver's spot price of $6.30 an ounce. The 1986 Silver Eagle is in the $12 to $14 range because it has a higher numismatic value; only five million such coins were minted in November and December 1986, when the program began. **********Investors can also buy stock in individual mining companies or gold-oriented mutual funds. **********Is gold a good investment now? At about $438 an ounce, it now trades at its lowest level in nearly 10 months, and has fallen about 8 percent since Jan. 1. In December, gold reached a five-year high of slightly more than $500 an ounce. Gold peaked at $850 an ounce in January 1980, during a time of high inflation.

Mironenko's son, Dima, turned 14 a month ago, and like most Soviet teen-agers he now faces an important decision. Will he join Komsomol, the huge youth arm of the Communist Party and the route to power and prestige for generations of Communists, including Mikhail S. Gorbachev? **********Not long ago the answer would have been obvious. After all, Dima's father is the national head of Komsomol. Yet Dima is undecided. **********''I tried to talk with him twice about this subject, but he hasn't given me an answer,'' said Mr. Mironenko, with a trace of exasperation. ''He evades the answer. He says, 'I have to think about it.' '' **********Dima's hesitation about something that was once a foregone conclusion of Soviet adolescence is one symptom of turbulent times in the Communist youth organization. **********In growing numbers, Soviet young people are rejecting Komsomol as stuffy and doctrinaire, and some of them are trying to organize their own, independent forms of political activity. **********In an interview Thursday in his spacious office at the Komsomol central committee headquarters, Mr. Mironenko talked for nearly three hours about Komsomol's dwindling membership, its tarnished reputation, and the challenge presented by unofficial political clubs that have sprung up in response to Mr. Gorbachev's promises of greater pluralism and democracy. Bureaucracy and Self-Importance **********He criticized Komsomol for lapsing into bureaucracy and self-importance, but insisted that the organization would recover its position as the unquestioned molder of orthodox Marxist-Leninists. **********''The rumors of the death of Komsomol are greatly exaggerated,'' he said, reciting a line he has had occasion to use more often than he would like. **********Among the points Mr. Mironenko made during the interview were these: *********** He denied charges that Komsomol is out to crush the activities of independent political clubs that have emerged as budding rivals to his organization. But he admitted that he had read and supported a personal attack on several leaders of unofficial political groups before it was published last Sunday in the Komsomol newspaper. *********** He disclosed that Komsomol membership has declined by nearly 4 million, to about 38 million, since 1985, and that the number of 14- and 15-year-olds who chose to join has dropped by one fourth. He said this reflects ''a certain loss of authority,'' but also results from a deliberate decision to ease the pressure on teen-agers to join. *********** He said he agrees with Soviet analysts who believe that a growing number of Soviet young people are drifting toward religion, but he said he sees no reason to change the policy banning believers from Komsomol. Atheist education is one of the primary tasks of the youth organization. **********Komsomol - formally the All-Union Leninist Communist Union of Youth -is open to young people aged 14 to 30, and while membership is not mandatory, it has long been considered important for admission to good universities and for some careers, such as teaching, the law, the military officer ranks or journalism. **********Under Mr. Gorbachev, Komsomol has the added task of mobilizing an evidently ambivalent younger generation behind the campaign for economic and political change. **********Mr. Mironenko, at 34, is the youngest man to head the Communist organization in nearly a quarter of a century. **********He oversees an organization of 100,000 paid apparatchiks, with a budget he estimates as ''several hundred million'' rubles. 3 Visits to U.S. **********A former history teacher with thinning, close-cropped brown hair and the earnest, animated speaking style of a practiced politician, he was brought to Moscow from the Ukraine in July 1986, apparently to clean house and give Komsomol a more modern image. **********He has traveled to the United States three times, keeps a computer near his desk, and sprinkles his conversation with lines from Twain, Saint-Exupery, and Napoleon. **********Since his arrival in Moscow, Mr. Mironenko has begun to shift Komsomol's emphasis from tedious meetings and pointless civic projects to such matters as improving scientific and professional training, construction of youth housing complexes, and improving treatment of veterans. **********But the criticism has not abated. Many young people still joke about Komsomol activists, calling them ''troikas,'' slang for three-piece suits. Boris N. Yeltsin, before his removal last November as head of the Moscow Communist Party organization, called Komsomol ''undemocratic and out of touch with young people.'' **********More recently, Komsomol has faced unexpected competition from independent organizations, including a nationwide network of veterans of the war in Afghanistan, informal environmental groups, and political clubs of various stripes. **********Last November Komsomol swept most of the veterans' clubs under its wing, and more recently it has set out to assert its influence over other independent groups. **********An internal report prepared last fall by the agitation and propaganda department of Komsomol warned that independent groups were luring away young people ''disillusioned by formalism'' in Komsomol, and recommended procedures to discredit ''extremist leaders'' and bring the others ''within the framework of existing Komsomol organizations.'' **********Mr. Mironenko, in the interview, said the document was sent to local Komsomol officials as ''orientation and guidance.'' He insisted it did not amount to stifling or banning independent political activity, as independent activists who learned of it believed. **********The message, he said, was that local Komsomol leaders should pay close attention to the groups, offering cooperation and financial help if their views were consistent with ''the generally accepted view of socialism.'' **********But he added, ''There are groups that are, maybe not anti-socialist, but with their own interpretation of socialism.'' In those cases, he said, Komsomol ''should sustain relations until the group is within the framework of the law.'' **********Moreover, he said, local officials should make sure Komsomol members are not involved in groups that deviate from the party line. 'The Komsomol Code' **********''I see no contradiction between the existence of Komsomol and the existence of the widest spectrum of the most different groups,'' he said. ''The conflict arises when the activity of an individual in a specific organization contradicts the Komsomol code he promised to observe.'' **********Many organizers of independent groups are also members of Komsomol, and some hope to form a cooperative relationship that will assure their legal status and perhaps afford them access to such scarce necessities as printing presses. **********''We believe there are Komsomol people who want to cooperate, and others who want to stamp us out,'' said Andrei Isaev, a history student and an organizer of the Federation of Socialist Social Clubs, an umbrella group of various political clubs. **********The hopes of young political activists for peaceful coexistence with Komsomol were shaken last Sunday when the Komsomol newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, singled out several activists by name and accused them of extremism, inflated ambition and anti-Soviet views. **********It was the first time the authoritative Komsomol newspaper had devoted a major article to the subject, and independent activists said it would be widely interpreted by local officials as a signal to crack down. **********In the interview, Mr. Mironenko at first said he did not know the identity of the pen-named authors of the article, and had not seen it until the newspaper was hand-delivered to his apartment, as it is every day at 7 A.M. **********As the interview ended, the Komsomol chief abruptly volunteered: ''I told you two lies. I know who wrote the article, and I read it before it was published.'' **********The authors, he said, were instructors at a training academy for Komsomol leaders - he declined to name them - and they consulted with Komsomol officials before writing their attack. **********''The opinions expressed there are consistent with the views of a majority of the leadership of the Komsomol central committee,'' Mr. Mironenko said. Legal Action Is Threatened **********Boris Kagarlitsky, an organizer of the Federation of Socialist Social Clubs, who was denounced in the article as a self-promoter with anti-Soviet views, said this week that he would file a lawsuit demanding a retraction. Leaders of several other groups this week also expressed shock and alarm about the article. **********''I think the attack is not against me - the attack is against the whole movement,'' Mr. Kagarlitsky said. **********Independent activists said the price of cooperating with Komsomol was also demonstrated last weekend, when Mr. Kagarlitsky's federation held a conference of unofficial political clubs in Moscow. **********Komsomol offered cooperation, including legal protection for the meeting and a conference hall, but imposed several restrictions. The size and agenda of the meeting were limited, foreign journalists were banned, Komsomol officials guarded the door, and young Communists loudly protested whenever unorthodox political views were expressed, according to several participants. **********Mr. Mironenko applauded the Komsomol activists for trying to establish ''a dialogue'' with the informal federation. **********''These are young people,'' he said. ''Many of them are involved in what we think are interesting activities. Some of them are Komsomol members. We are interested in listening to them, finding out what problems they face, and helping them if necessary.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/06/world/16-still-missing-in-lebanon-when-they-disappeared.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "16 Still Missing in Lebanon: When They Disappeared", "print_headline": "16 Still Missing in Lebanon: When They Disappeared", "body_text": " **********AMERICAN  Terry A.

Once an industry made up of dozens of independent, family-run companies, book publishing is now dominated by six major companies: Advance Publications, Hearst, MCA, the Pearson Group, Bertlesmann A.G. and Gulf and Western. With so much consolidation, how will book publishing change?  Michael Korda  Editor in chief, Simon & Schuster, a unit of Gulf and Western. **********It doesn't make any difference who owns the companies as long as the people who work in them are the same. Who puts up the capital doesn't matter. **********This is a quirky business. If Simon & Schuster were to buy Farrar Straus & Giroux, we'd be crazy to change it. If you bought it and the authors left and the corporate identity and quality went down the drain, why buy it? This is what it is hard to get across. There are some consolidations and we're getting some economies of scale, but this is not a business of corporate mergers and acquisitions. **********For authors, the consolidation is terrific. As more money comes into book publishing, there is a price escalation for best-selling authors. There are very few of these authors and everyone needs them and anyone starting off has to buy from a limited list.  Philip Wood  President, Ten Speed Press. **********The recent consolidations will not make much of a difference to the smaller publishers. We do our own distribution. There are people breathing down our necks to buy our company - I must get an offer a week. **********It is starting to worry me that the big companies are hiring good editors and starting to compete for the same projects we like to do. Simon & Schuster is trying to make money on cook books and they are trying to buy properties aggressively. Previously they lost money but now they are smarter and they've beaten us to some properties. But the fastest-growing segment of this business is smaller independent companies. We're very profitable and we're not concerned with the concentration of the big companies.  Steven Mason  President, Ingram Book Company. **********My concern is with the editorial integrity of the various book lines. In the past, each company tried to maintain its integrity. With the concentration, you could have less bidding competition among publishers for authors. Another concern is with the publishers' sales representatives. If a good rep handles 100 titles for a publisher, and after the merger has to handle 300 titles, this is disturbing. **********Mergers may also affect the terms offered to wholesalers and retailers. Right now the policies and terms are different. No matter what happens in terms of concentration, independent wholesale distribution services will be needed.  Ivan Obolensky  Senior vice president, Josephthal & Company. **********Book publishers are merging because they are petrified that they are all going to be bought out by foreign companies and so they are getting together. The devaluation of the dollar is at the root of their fears. **********American publishers haven't been aware of the computerization of printing and of the ability of the English language to travel - which means they haven't been aware of the value of their backlists. People around the world are looking for literature in English. **********The next takeover target in publishing is Houghton Mifflin & Company. It is the best publishing company in America with the best backlist of titles. School districts are concentrating more on teaching English, and Houghton Mifflin is able to dust off its old texts, add new advisers and sell those texts once more."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/05/business/stock-index-inquiry-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Index Inquiry Report", "print_headline": "Stock Index Inquiry Report", "body_text": " **********The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said today that it had found no evidence of price manipulation in the Major Market Index, a stock index futures contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, during the October market collapse. **********An article in The Wall Street Journal after the collapse suggested that a handful of large firms had manipulated prices in the index during a brief period on Oct. 20 in an attempt to prop up rapidly falling stock prices. **********But the agency's division of trading and markets released a 45-page study today that stated it had ''not found any reasonable indication that price manipulation occurred in the M.M.I. on Oct. 20.''

Probably both, sharply, and several times, if the recent past is any guide. **********Oil markets were shaken last week by the apparent readiness of Iran and Iraq to cease hostilities. That could sharply decrease the divisiveness within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which would permit production cuts and thus, price rises. **********As measured by prices in the futures markets, that school of thought is now dominant. But some traders and other experts think that the result will be the opposite - that an end to hostilities would unleash a flood of oil on world markets as the military threat to oil tankers is removed and as Iran and Iraq raise production to finance postwar reconstruction. Any increase in supplies would depress prices. **********Whether prices rise or fall, the energy situation poses challenges for the industry and for whoever moves into the White House in January. **********The United States has a big oil deficit; it consumes lots of oil but produces only a little more than half of it, and production is likely to shrink further in years to come, according to the Department of Energy and the oil industry. A decline in domestic drilling, experts say, leads to higher spending for imports. **********OPEC, meanwhile, has lost - at least temporarily - the clout it wielded in the 1970's, when it engineered short-term interruptions that sharply increased oil prices. **********Currently, the Persian Gulf countries supply 18.2 percent of imports to the United States. Another 40 percent, however, comes from closer, friendlier sources: Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. And Canada's reserves now appear to be even more accessible to the United States because of the Free Trade Agreement that is before legislators in Washington and Ottawa. **********But if demand increases, spare capacity would have to be put into service, and most of that is in the Persian Gulf, giving that region the ''swing vote'' in the market place. Because the Middle East still has most of the world's oil, it will be the key factor in the energy markets for as long as oil dominates the United States' energy needs. **********In the long term, the level of imports depends largely on price. If world oil prices stay low, the decline of production in this country will accelerate, according to experts. Drilling companies believe that in the current soft market most locations where oil can be profitably drilled lie abroad. **********A corollary is that lower prices make American wells uncompetitive. They also encourage consumption. That combination can produce higher imports - and, with them, a higher import bill. **********But if prices get too high, demand will fall. In that case, America can do more with less oil, and more with other forms of energy, like natural gas, coal and nuclear power. For example, cars could run on natural gas, on liquids made from coal or on electricity made from coal or uranium. There is also substitution: fiberglass in attics and caulk around windows saved gallons of oil or therms of gas. Indeed, substitutes for oil may become more prevalent, regardless of price, if the greenhouse effect induces conservation on environmental grounds. **********Substitution is reassuring for the economy as a whole, but not for the oil sector, which is now in the midst of a contraction. **********And that poses new questions for policy makers. As Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire told energy company executives in Washington recently, ''This country does not know today whether it wants high oil prices and a strong domestic industry, or low prices and no domestic industry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/28/world/mexico-city-journal-from-reviled-ex-leader-a-double-barreled-blast.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1988-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1059, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico City Journal; From Reviled Ex-Leader, a Double-Barreled Blast", "print_headline": "Mexico City Journal; From Reviled Ex-Leader, a Double-Barreled Blast", "body_text": " **********On Thursday, Miguel de la Madrid will step down as President of Mexico and Carlos Salinas de Gortari will take his place. But in the cafes of the Mexican capital and on radio talk shows, the two men have suddenly been forced to share the limelight with a former President who left office six years ago under the darkest of clouds: Jose Lopez Portillo. **********After a long silence, Mr. Lopez Portillo has resurfaced with a vengeance by publishing his memoirs, called ''My Times: Biography and Political Testament.'' In two volumes sprawling over 1,293 pages, the man who governed Mexico from 1976 to 1982 heaps lavish praise on his now-despised administration, castigates political adversaries, and even takes a few oblique pokes at his successor and his successor's successor. **********Though the book shot to the top of the best-seller list in just a week when it was published this month, it has not exactly been greeted warmly. To many of his compatriots, Mr. Lopez Portillo is perhaps the greatest villain of contemporary Mexican history, the leader who promised to ''administer abundance'' but quadrupled the foreign debt and presided over a Government that even some members of his own party now describe as the most corrupt of modern times. **********Mr. Lopez Portillo need only emerge from his hilltop home in the capital's northwestern suburbs for people to jeer at him in the streets or even, as was recently reported, hit him over the head with their shopping bags and call him a thief. It was in response to this ''extremely negative image I have in Mexican society,'' he said, that the book was written. 'A Cascade of Filth' **********''It was a decision I took in order to explain my period of responsibility, especially in view of the enormous distance between my intentions and the moral judgment of my actions that has been formulated,'' the former President said not long ago in his first on-the-record interview since leaving office. ''There was a cascade of filth, of calumnies and defamation, pouring over me, and I would not have been able to stand it had I not vented my feelings.'' **********For most Mexicans, the most visible and grating symbol of the billions of dollars Mr. Lopez Portillo is widely thought to have stashed away in Swiss banks is the former President's complex of four houses, popularly known as Dog Hill, a sarcastic reminder that he once promised ''to defend the peso like a dog.'' The main house, in which the former President lives, writes and paints, has a five-story library and a large collection of weapons and art, and is guarded by a Mexican Army squad. **********In ''My Times,'' Mr. Lopez Portillo acknowledges that he could not have built his hillside redoubt without receiving favored treatment from political clients. But he defends that behavior and his decision to accept a house in Acapulco that was a present to him from the Oil Workers Union. **********''It would have been an ostentatious impertinence not to have done so,'' he writes of the Acapulco gift. ''It is a great honor. They ask nothing of me in return and give me, furthermore, friendship and solidarity.'' **********''I'm not ashamed of anything,'' he said when the issue of propriety was raised during the interview. ''I committed only the sin of scandal.'' Decision on Banks Defended **********Mr. Lopez Portillo also shows no remorse for his decisions in 1982 to impose exchange controls and nationalize Mexico's banking system, measures that were derided then and are seen now as responsible for many of Mexico's later economic problems. ''I would do everything over again exactly the same,'' he said, ''but with one exception: I would have acted earlier.'' **********Because Mr. Lopez Portillo declines to show the repentance Mexicans want of him, ''My Times'' has set off a new round of condemnations against him. In a typical letter, written to the newspaper Excelsior, one Cecilia Martinez argued that ''two tomes full of fallacies cannot erase'' the damage done by an administration ''that demolished forever the hopes of many generations.'' **********Describing himself in the book as ''half-intellectual, half-philosopher, half-writer, half-painter, half-sportsman, half-teacher, half-orator and half . . . vain,'' Mr. Lopez Portillo retorts that he has been both misunderstood and betrayed. So strong are his feelings that he broke with Mexican tradition, which dictates that the memoirs of former presidents do not appear until after their death, in order to express what he calls ''my truth'' about his friends and former collaborators, many of whom have now abandoned or condemned him. Enigma That Was Carter **********Mr. Lopez Portillo fires rounds not only at his Mexican political associates but also at the two American Presidents with whom he dealt, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Although he and Mr. Reagan ''did not agree on practically anything,'' he said in the interview, that relationship was a vast improvement over trying to figure out Mr. Carter. ''With Reagan, you get a room with a floor, a roof, walls and windows,'' he said. ''You know what to expect. With Carter, no. I never understood Carter and never really knew what he wanted.'' **********Mr. Lopez Portillo says he thinks his insistence on standing up to Washington is at least partly responsible for his misfortunes. He accuses the Reagan Administration of conducting a vendetta against him ''for reasons of my Central American policy, and for no other reason.'' **********''My own dishonor has been caused, in great measure, by the publication in American newspapers and magazines that I was the seventh richest man in the world because I had spirited out of the country between five and seven billion dollars,'' he said. **********''This is an infamous lie, and I know it came from up there,'' he added, his voice rising. ''Perhaps it was the C.I.A.

Like the rest of the region, the town has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, twice the national average. The town has been largely abandoned -the population has fallen to 700, largely retired people, from almost 5,000 just after the war - as people emigrated to look for work or simply moved down to the seaside, now safe, for a more convenient life. **********Mr. Lanciano, the town librarian, tried to halt the decay by zealously publicizing the idea that Badolato wanted to sell itself to someone who would convert it into a tourist village and create jobs for all.

It went on to describe a plan to transform the town into a cultural center and tourist village, and concluded, ''Everyone is agreed, administrators and citizens, that this is the only solution.'' **********Mr. Lanciano smiles a bit shyly when he concedes that he really had not discussed his idea with many in people in town. ''Even if they were not in agreement when that story appeared,'' he said, ''many people thought it was a great idea later when all the other papers did stories and all the TV crews came here.'' **********Two months after Mr. Lanciano's article appeared, a town assembly accepted the idea of selling some vacant houses as a block, but not the whole town. Some residents protested that making Badolato a tourist village was an ignoble proposition, and within a week regional authorities objected to even a limited sell-off. **********The protests did not matter much because by then the story of the town for sale had its own momentum. Last spring developers from as far away as Switzerland and Israel started coming to take a look, but none considered it a feasible project despite the potential appeal of unspoiled countryside and beaches. A Buyer Is/Is Not Found **********But Mr. Lanciano did not give up. In December he wrote to Silvio Berlusconi, a Milan-based real estate and television magnate, that offered Christmas greetings and asked for the millionaire's ''solidarity'' with Badolato. He got a perfunctory but cordial reply. A few days later several major papers reported that Mr. Berlusconi intended to buy Badolato. **********''Well, it is just a matter of how you interpret 'solidarity', '' Mr. Lanciano said. ''Maybe he did not say that he would buy the town, but he did not say that he would not, so theoretically it was possible.'' Mr. Berlusconi issued a denial that he had any interest in acquiring the town. **********Late one night Mr. Lanciano stood on a balcony overlooking moribund streets where houses built by Norman soldiers were crumbling into piles of shadows. After hundreds of interviews with news organizations, he confessed, ''It was all a provocation, all this hoopla, and I have to say it was a failure.'' 'I Acted Only Out of Love' **********''Maybe I did wrong,'' he added, ''but I acted only out of love for this, nothing else. It was love.'' **********A few days after the flurry over the Berlusconi letters, town officials took away the manual typewriter Mr. Lanciano had used. His contract as librarian has not been renewed. Now he is waiting to see if the regional government comes through with a promise to give Badolato some money for restoration and economic development. **********''I'll keep Badolato in the press a little while longer to keep the pressure on them, and then I too will become an emigrant because there is no work for me here without the library,'' he said. **********His last act as librarian was to move a big stone from Badolato's demolished castle to a little piazza in the lower town. He christened it ''the memory stone,'' he said, ''so that when Badolato is gone, people will remember where they came from.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-ex-creative-director-offers-book-on-ad-game.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Creative Director Offers Book on Ad Game", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Ex-Creative Director Offers Book on Ad Game", "body_text": " **********Edward Caffrey has now contributed his wit and wisdom to the growing collection of books on breaking into the ad game. **********The former senior vice president and creative director of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, who spent 31 years in the business, is the author of ''So You Want to Be in Advertising,'' a paperback Fireside Book from Simon & Schuster for $8.95. **********Like many other books of the genre, it describes the agency business and the various job disciplines before it offers suggestions on how to break in.

Iran also was active on other fronts today, attacking a freighter in the Persian Gulf and firing a missile into Baghdad. Photos Point to Chemical Attack **********Don Kerr of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London said in a telephone interview that a study of photographs of the casualties of the reported Iraqi bombardment of Halabja had ''very much persuaded me that these people had died of chemical agents.'' **********''There was no evidence of projectile injuries on the bodies,'' he said.  [ Foreign journalists visiting the stricken town saw scores of bodies in the streets and in the rubble of smashed buildings, Reuters reported from Halabja. The news agency quoted doctors as saying that the appearance of corpses indicated they had died of cyanide poisoning.  [ At the nearby village of Anap, Reuters reported, bodies were hanging out of cars in which they had evidently tried to escape. ]  The United Nations has accused Iraq of using chemical weapons in the past, and Mr. Kerr said the recent course of the Iran-Iraq war suggested that toxic gas had been used in the land conflict with Iran when it seemed that Teheran's forces were on the point of major successes. **********Iraq has denied all previous charges that it has used chemical weapons, which are banned under international law.

Referring to the Iraqi Government of President Saddam Hussein, he said Iran would not halt its war until ''the root of mischief is eliminated from the region.''

It remained unclear whether Iran would seek to follow up the capture of Halabja with a further offensive into the inhospitable and mountainous terrain that lies between the town and Iraq's oilfields around Kirkuk, about 75 miles to the west. **********Some military analysts in the gulf region suggested that Iran's intention might be to tie down Iraqi forces by further increasing support for the long-running Kurdish insurrection. **********In action on other fronts in the conflict, Iran fired a surface-to-surface missile at Baghdad, its first in four days, in reprisal for an Iraqi missile attack on Teheran on Tuesday in the so-called ''war of the cities.'' **********Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf attacked a Cypriot tanker, the 34,346-ton Odysseas H, near the Strait of Hormuz and set it afire.

''Please don't hurt me!'' Mr. Harvey was heard to yell. ''I've done everything you asked.'' **********As they put him in a squad car, the police officers told him he would not be hurt. **********While holding the hostages, Mr. Harvey said he was trying to draw attention to the nation's homeless and hungry. **********Al DuPont, the Mayor of Tuscaloosa, said Mr. Harvey was shown a videotape made by Gov. Guy Hunt. Then, as part of an agreement, Mr. Harvey turned over his weapons and began to lead the child hostages outside for what he believed would be a news conference.

But the Governor said the promise carried no legal weight. **********''I'm just glad we were able to resolve it and none of those children were hurt,'' Governor Hunt said in Montgomery, the state capital. **********The children, all in lower elementary grades, and their parents hugged each other and cried as they were reunited in the gymnasium of the school, a private academy founded by the West End Baptist Church. The children told relatives who had gathered, ''We're all right, we're all right.''

''I'm doing this for them.

Other hostages had been released earlier. Two Gunmen Took Over School **********Police said two men wearing ski masks and carrying at least one rifle invaded the school about 8:40 A.M., shortly after classes began. Police Lieut.

When they listened to their husbands' dueling proverbs, their stolid expressions melted into laughter. By the time they emerged from the towering Assumption Cathedral, Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev were holding hands. **********Was this the gesture that stilled a thousand tongues? By the evening of Mrs. Reagan's first day in Moscow, that seemed at least possible. **********The hand-holding, customary among Russian women of all ages, continued as the women strolled along looking across the Moscow River underneath a brilliantly blue sky. **********Last December, the frigid joint appearances of Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev lent credence to rumors of mutual dislike and disdain, rumors that eventually blossomed into cattiness - Mrs. Gorbachev's stockings were baggy; Mrs. Reagan did not know when the White House was built. Tea and Art Appreciation **********Today, the two women were making a concerted effort to be correct, if not downright chummy. They appreciated art together. They had a 25-minute tea together in the Kremlin Palace. And when they got annoyed, they got annoyed together - at reporters' persistent questioning about the feud. **********As a result of the tour of the cathedral, Mrs. Gorbachev received an unusual amount of air time on the evening news program Vremya, and some live coverage earlier in the day during the Kremlin tour with Mrs. Reagan. Soviet television, like the Soviet press, tends to relegate the wives of leaders to the background. To film the wife without the leader is a rare occurrence, though since Mikhail S. Gorbachev took office it is not unique. **********After the exchange of greetings in the Kremlin, Mrs. Gorbachev escorted Mrs. Reagan toward the cathedral, talking in brisk, instructive tones about the sights around them. **********When Mrs. Gorbachev was asked what message she had for Americans, she said, ''Peace and friendship and that they understand the Soviet people.'' When Mrs. Reagan was asked how she felt about being in the Soviet Union, she said: ''Wonderful. Very exciting. It's a little overwhelming.'' Icy Toward Reporters **********Later, as Mrs. Reagan was strolling with President Reagan down the Arbat, Moscow's pedestrian mall, she said that her visit with Mrs. Gorbachev ''went fine.'' **********''There were some other things I wish I had been able to see,'' she said. ''I only got to see the Assumption Cathedral.'' But no disappointment was expressed to Mrs. Gorbachev during their visit, as an atmosphere of determined harmony prevailed. **********The pair turned frigid only when accompanying reporters questioned them about the supposed feud. Asked by the NBC News correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, if the former White House chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, was wrong in reporting that Mrs. Reagan once said of Mrs. Gorbachev, ''Who does that dame think she is?'' the First Lady's smile turned to ice and her eyes to fire. He was wrong, she said. **********As for their previous meetings, Mrs. Reagan said in response to reporters' queries, ''We've gotten along very well every other time.'' **********There was, however, a moment of tension inside the cathedral. Mrs. Gorbachev had just finished a discourse on an icon of the Madonna and Child, when Mrs. Reagan hurriedly put in a question: ''This cathedral now, is it mainly used as just a museum or religious activities also?'' **********Hearing Mrs. Gorbachev answer, hastily, ''Nyet,'' Mrs. Reagan said, ''Oh, yes, the word ''nyet'' - that I understand.'' A Politburo Full of Hostesses **********During the coming week, the job of hosting Mrs. Reagan will be divided among a variety of Politburo wives. Nanuli Shevardnadze, wife of the Foreign Minister, will greet her at Special School No. 29 on Monday morning; Lidiya Gromyko, wife of the Soviet President, will serve as hostess for the First Lady's trip to Leningrad. **********Whoever is playing hostess, the schedule for the Reagans will offer them a look at Russia's cultural past and the pluralism of the Soviet Union's cultural present. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev and their wives will also attend back-to-back state dinners, first in the Granovitaya Palata, or Faceted Chamber, of the Kremlin Palace and then in Spaso House, the American ambassadorial residence. **********On Monday morning, after visiting the school, Mrs. Reagan will have an opportunity to experience the Russian love of poetry as she visits the grave and the country house of Boris Pasternak, the writer whose works and creative martyrdom have made him an icon for two generations of liberal Soviet intellectuals. Lunch With Writers **********This visit to the writers' colony of Peredelkino, where Pasternak is buried, will conclude with a private lunch hosted by the poet Andrei Voznesensky and his wife, the writer Zoya Boguslavskaya. **********Mrs. Boguslavskaya, who on Saturday still did not know if the visit would take place, nonetheless showed perfect aplomb. ''I'm not concerned,'' she said, ''We always have berries and pastries handy.'' **********On Tuesday, the First Lady will travel to Russia's old imperial capital and the cradle of the revolution, Leningrad, where she will lay a wreath at a memorial commemorating the defenders of the city and the 650,000 who died during the Nazis' 900-day siege. **********Then, under the guidance of some of the Soviet Union's cultural experts - including Dmitri S. Likhachev, a revered scholar here - she will tour the collections of the Hermitage museum and then board a hydrofoil for a ride up the Neva River to the Gulf of Finland and Petrodvorets, the summer palace of Peter the Great. **********Mrs. Gorbachev will resume her discussion of icons at the Tretyakov Gallery on Wednesday. The three centerpieces of the museum's icon collection are two masterpieces by the 15th-century master Andrei Rublev and the Virgin of Vladimir, a grieving Madonna and Child whose legendary wonder-working powers have made it the best known and most beloved icon of Russian history. A Night at the Ballet **********It was a copy of this icon, hanging in the Assumption Cathedral that most sparked Mrs. Reagan's interest during her tour with Mrs. Gorbachev. As Mrs. Gorbachev pointed out how the child's cheek seemed to support the head of the grieving mother, Mrs. Reagan murmured, ''Very, very maternal.'' **********On Wednesday evening, the Reagans will have a chance to see one of the other great achievements of Russian culture: the ballet. The Bolshoi Ballet will put its best stars forward - Andris Liepa, Nina Ananiashvili and Irek Mukhamedov - in short moments from ballets ranging from the classical (''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Swan Lake'') to the modern pyrotechnics of the artistic director Yuri Grigorovich (''Spartacus'' and ''The Golden Age''). **********But the all-Soviet show may have one American interlude.

It would dwarf the $11.5 billion that the Philip Morris Companies offered last week for Kraft Inc. and the $6.2 billion that Kohlberg, Kravis and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. paid in 1986 for the Beatrice Companies, another foods concern, in a leveraged buyout. **********In addition, the expected offer, which the professionals said would be made this morning, would exceed by $13.25 a share Friday's closing price of RJR Nabisco stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Follows Management Proposal **********The offer, if it is made, would come on the heels of the announcement on Thursday by RJR Nabisco's top management and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. that they planned to offer $75 a share, or $17 billion, to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. A leveraged buyout is the purchase of a company with relatively little in the way of equity money and a large amount of debt secured for the most part by the assets of the company being acquired. **********After the announcement last Thursday, RJR Nabisco's share price soared more than $21 a share, to $77.25, indicating that speculators were anticipating a higher offer. On Friday, the stock closed at $76.75. **********RJR Nabisco, an Atlanta-based conglomerate that is America's 19th-largest industrial concern, was formed three years ago from the merger of R. J.

Mr. Johnson's management group has not made a formal offer yet. And Kohlberg, Kravis is already working on several billion dollars' worth of transactions in what has already proven to be one of its busiest years. It is unclear whether other bids may be made, to buy either the whole concern or just some of its parts, such as some of its many food brands. **********The group led by Mr. Johnson plans to sell off most of RJR Nabisco's food lines to pay down the more than $15 billion in debt the buyout would involve, Wall Street sources said. **********The Kohlberg, Kravis group would also sell off some of the food lines to help finance the transaction, according to the sources."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/08/business/business-people-an-embattled-utl-elects-top-executive.html": {"writer_name": "Nina Andrews", "pub_date": "1988-12-08", "snippet": "LEAD: The UTL Corporation, the military electronics company whose founder and chief executive, C.

Buttery and colleagues at the department's research center in Albany, Calif., have identified an enzyme system that controls tomato smell. When a tomato is cut, linolenic acid is converted by enzymes into Z-3-hexenal. This chemical is largely responsible for fresh tomato smell.

Today the Soviet Union said fighting there was continuing, and spokesmen for two guerrilla groups said in Pakistan that their forces held the city. **********The Soviet Army's eight remaining bases are said to be in the provinces of Baghlan, Herat, Kabul, Parwan and Samangan.

The company had its share of debacles, like its disastrous 1978 attempt to make a ''sports'' fragrance. But those were overshadowed by such successes as Jovan Musk, a long-running hit. Over all, Jovan was profitable enough to persuade Beecham to buy it in 1979 for $85 million. **********The new Beecham division, which was renamed Beecham Cosmetics, grew over the next decade, pushing into 6 continents and 76 countries.

The Soviet Union denies that this larger group has been jailed on political grounds, saying they are in prison for valid criminal charges. The United States and human rights groups have challenged the Soviet assertion. **********Some State Department officials cautioned that Mr. Kohl's remarks probably only applied to the 48 cases in which the Russians have acknowledged jailing citizens on political grounds. **********State Department officials said a similar confusion developed last month when the Soviet Foreign Minister visited the United States. Mr. Shevardnadze reportedly told American officials that all political prisoners would be released.

To meet those payments, the prospectus said, the company would have no choice but to improve its results. **********No problem. I.B.M.'s new owners would just have to curtail spending sharply on research and development.

Ending Quaint Job Policy **********In addition, the offering recommended discontinuing certain products and ending the company's quaint policy of virtually guaranteeing lifetime employment. **********''While the company intends to continue to deal with all its constituencies in a fair and caring manner, financial constraints will dictate a comprehensive personnel restructuring program aimed at rationalization, efficiency and employee awareness,'' the prospectus said. **********To finance this transaction, Mr. Grant envisioned a gaggle of debt instruments, ranging from ''junior subordinated perpetual zero coupon debentures'' to ''superconductivity debentures.'' Although this leverage would cause I.B.M.'s debt-to-equity ratio to soar from its historical level of 0.2:1 to 19.4:1, Mr. Grant's offering did not anticipate any problems financing the deal. **********''It is a canard that, in a world fairly soaking wet with liquidity, any reasonable amount of money is too much,'' came the word from the ''underwriter.'' **********What motivated Mr. Grant to produce such a document?

The carrier had a net loss of $97.9 million in the 1987 quarter. **********Texas Air said Continental's losses were caused by bad weather and the costs of integrating the airline into the parent, two factors that had also been problems in late 1987. **********One analyst, who asked not to be identified, said a Texas Air official had said that Continental lost $8.8 million on an operational basis in the 1988 quarter. ''This shows that Eastern is not Texas Air's only problem,'' the analyst added. **********Continental had costs of 6.38 cents a seat mile for the quarter, one of the lowest rates in the industry, said one analyst who asked not to be identified, but the airline still had heavy losses in the first quarter. A seat mile is the cost of carrying a passenger one mile. **********Eastern had costs of 7.98 cents a seat mile, slightly higher than costs at such competitors as Delta, 7.56 cents, and lower than United's costs of 8.2 cents. **********Leaders of Eastern's unions have repeatedly argued that merely cutting labor costs does not make a carrier viable, pointing out that Continental, despite its lower costs, was showing large losses. Eastern has been seeking concessions from the International Assocation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union.  Capacity Cut by 13.6 Percent **********Of greater concern to some analysts was Eastern's decline in traffic in April. Since last year, Eastern has reduced its capacity by 13.6 percent, but the traffic loss of 21.8 percent indicated that the safety investigation begun last month by the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as Eastern's labor turmoil, was having an effect. **********The Department of Transportation began the investigation after it found that more than $800,000 in fines had been imposed on Eastern because of safety violations. The department said it wanted to determine if the financial transactions of Texas Air and its subsidiaries were having any impact on safety. The inspecton is expected to be completed later this month.  Suit Filed Against Unions **********Toughening its stance, Eastern yesterday filed suit against its two major unions, the machinists and the Air Line Pilots Association, charging that their leaders engaged in racketeering, extortion, fraud and defamation in an attempt to destroy Eastern. **********The complaint, filed in the Federal District Court in Miami, asserted that the unions were ''attempting to obtain ownership and control of Eastern through an extortionate scheme to smear the company's reputation.'' **********Eastern's unions had previously filed a suit in the Federal District Court in Washington, accusing Texas Air of acquiring Eastern illegally. **********J. J. Bavis, chairman of the pilots' executive council at Eastern, said the carrier's lawsuit was an example of management's ''blindly striking back at the pilots for alerting Congress and the regulatory agencies to the problems at the airline.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/23/business/4303-surge-puts-dow-at-215220.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1988-06-23", "snippet": "LEAD: The stock market soared yesterday in heavy volume, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.03 points to close at 2,152.20.

On the New York Stock Exchange, 217.5 million shares were traded, up from 155.1 million shares Tuesday. **********On the Big Board, 1,144 stocks rose and 413 fell.

In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index of thousands of stocks rose 2.78, to 390.53, its high since the October crash.Bond Market Rally Cited **********The current surge in stocks, traders said, is tied to the strengthening of the dollar in the world's currency markets and to the related rally in the bond market, where prices rose sharply and yields fell yesterday. **********A firmer dollar attracts foreign investors into the huge American Treasury bond market; they like Treasury securities because they are very safe and easily bought and sold. When the dollar is falling, however, the value of their investments can erode through unfavorable currency translations. **********Market analysts said there was a big move yesterday by Japanese investors out of their own securities and into American Treasury bonds. That forced speculators here who had sold bonds short to buy them back, and that buying pushed Treasury bond prices even higher. Falling bond yields helped the stock market, traders said, because it made returns there look more favorable. In addition, they said, there was short-covering among stock speculators.Latest Data Bullish **********The bond market has also been helped by the latest economic indicators coming out of Washington -such as yesterday's durables goods report, showing a 2.2 percent order decline in May - which seemed to indicate that inflation fears recently stoked by the Farm Belt drought might be overdone. **********Another factor may have helped stock prices as well. With the end of the second quarter a week away, traders said many money managers were beginning to jump on the stock market's bandwagon, hoping to show their clients improved performance. **********''There is a lot of cash around,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of Shearson Lehman Hutton's stock index futures unit. ''A lot of managers underperformed the market in the first quarter. And a lot are underperforming it in the second quarter. How long can they go on doing that? It's all right to be negative, but you'd better be right. You want to show that at least you made an effort to participate in the market that made a new high for 1988.'' **********Mr. Grennan said index arbitrage program trading had played a role in yesterday's rally, ''but it was not a driving force.'' When the Dow rose by more than 50 points, the automatic ''collar'' that restricts program traders from using the Big Board's automatic order execution system went into effect, he noted. He said it had little impact on trading. **********Many stock market participants were encouraged by the strength and breadth of yesterday's rally. **********''This is good volume; we don't have any dividend plays,'' one trader said. ''The institutions are in this, and a lot of good stocks are leading the list.'' **********But others sounded notes of caution. ''It seems we have heard this talk about increased liquidity, foreign investment and all the rest before,'' one trader said. ''They were using the same arguments last year at this time. I don't buy any of this, given the real problems, like our current-account deficit, the bank problems, the third world debt problems. The only thing that has happened is that a year has passed.'' **********Among individual issues yesterday, International Business Machines, the day's most-active issue, rose 2 3/4, to 123, with 4 million shares changing hands. Traders expect I.B.M.'s new line of midrange computers to be well received. ''But for all its up and downs, I.B.M. is at the same price it was at last Oct. 21,'' one trader noted. **********Other blue chips also surged. Boeing rose 1 3/4, to 57 7/8; Du Pont 4 3/8, to 92 3/4; International Paper 1 7/8, to 48 1/4, and Woolworth 1 3/8, to 54 5/8. **********Fort Howard, a paper company, soared 8 1/8, to 48 3/8, on reports that the company might consider a management buyout. **********First Boston jumped 2 3/8, to 37 5/8, amid rumors that the company, which has announced talks with Credit Suisse, may be nearing some sort of deal. The stock has surged in recent days. **********In over-the-counter trading, Metropolitan Federal Savings and Loan dropped 4, to 18, as a takeover deal fell through.

But Armand H. (Pete) Mathieu Jr., president of Pete Mathieu (pronounced like Matthew) & Associates, found that when the college crowd graduated they tended to leave St. Pauli Girl behind, along with other symbols of their lost youth. **********When Mathieu received the brand along with other assignments from Carlton Importers, it did consumer research to find out why this German beer did not do better in the marketplace of imported-beer lovers who have rated German beers as the best. **********Simple. Only 22 percent of the target market perceived St. Pauli Girl as a German brand, even though the words Bremen, Germany, appear on the label. **********Using techniques it previously honed in the introduction of Perrier, as Mathieu, Gerfen & Bresner, the agency went about redesigning the label to make the German connection more apparent and to create 30-second and 10-second television commercials and a 60-second radio spot that also highlighted the German heritage. **********The TV spots show a woodworker carving the St. Pauli Girl symbol into the top of a barrel while the voice-over intones a number of sales points and ends up with ''Germany sends you her very best.'' **********The advertising and new packaging have been tested in Miami and Philadelphia for seven months, and Mr. Mathieu says the client reports they are working. **********St. Pauli Girl, brewed by Dribeck of Bremen, which also brews Becks beer, is imported into the United States by Carlton Importers, part of the McKesson Wine and Spirit Company, which the McKesson Corporation plans to sell off. **********So Mr. Mathieu and his associate, Richard Donovan, senior vice president, account services, who run the six-member, $10 million agency, are wondering whether they will be able to keep Carlton, their largest client. **********But since both have been in the business a long time, they have grown accustomed to the comings and goings of clients. **********Pete Mathieu, 55 years old, was born to a French Canadian immigrant who would eventually return home to Montreal after working up through sales to a high marketing spot with Kraft. That was a good enough connection to land his son a job with J. Walter Thompson after he dropped out of the University of Washington in Seattle. He had already been to Korea, where he was serving in a Navy cargo-handling unit. **********At Thompson, in Montreal, he was a copywriter and an account man who rose to account supervisor and creative director. By the time he was 26, in 1964, he was manager of the office. He decided he did not like administration, quietly resigned from the agency and was hired by the New York office, where he was used as a trouble shooter on the creative side. **********Four years later, he said, he departed because he did not think that top management - it was Danny Seymour at the time - had the proper respect for the creative product in the spirit of the late Stanley Resor, the legendary J.W.T. chief executive. His next stop was at John F. Small Inc. **********Then, in 1973, on his 40th birthday, he set up the first Pete Mathieu & Associates.

Two-thirds of them are working, or are dependents of those who work. About 19 percent of all children under the age of 18 are not covered by health insurance. In addition, an estimated 2 million people suffer from pre-existing or excluded conditions that preclude them from coverage, regardless of their employment or income status. Then there are many millions who are simply underinsured. Our inability to forge a universal system for insurance to manage health care for these millions is bad social and economic policy. **********How did we get to this point? The premise behind our health care financing is a collaborative public and private entitlement system that grew out of Depression-era conditions. Upon the enactment of the Social Security Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to the new contributory social insurance program as ''a cornerstone in the structure which is being built, but is by no means complete.'' Unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, employer-financed health insurance, and finally Medicare and Medicaid all followed. The Government and labor leaders who championed this system intended it to be universal, albeit by ''patchwork.'' The employment-based, tax-incentived, health insurance system initiated through collective bargaining in the 1940's and 1950's ostensibly would cover all American workers. The taxpayer-financed Medicare and Medicaid programs were designed to fill the gaps left at either end for the poor and the elderly, whose access to private insurance markets was blocked by the cost of voluntary individual coverage. **********However well intentioned, this ''patchwork'' system simply isn't working. While more families are living below the poverty level, Medicaid enrollment continues to drop. And fewer workers have health insurance as a fringe benefit as more people work in smaller, service businesses. **********Since Americans pay the health care tab for Americans one way or another, why not pay the bill head on, fairly and efficiently, through universal health insurance? Universal access to health insurance is likely to continue the public-private partnership that has been built over the last 50 years. All employees, regardless of health status, should be guaranteed basic health benefits for themselves and their dependents. For those outside the work force, Medicaid coverage should be made universally available, with appropriate subsidies for the poor. The over-65 population should continue on Medicare benefits, which should be further expanded to eliminate all costs to individuals for catastrophic care. **********Who will foot the bill? First of all, I believe that universal access will result primarily in the equitable redistribution of existing costs. Employers who don't provide health insurance will lose their free ride on the coattails of those who do. Small and start-up businesses can be assisted through tax incentives and legislatively mandated insurance pools that extend efficiencies now available only to big groups. Income-indexed, supplemental premiums will fill the gaps and further help offset costs. The Government will recoup some of its revenue losses by moving a segment of the population out of the publicly financed health care system into the private insurance sector. **********Every dollar not spent on primary care, particularly pre- and post-natal care, is a lost opportunity to invest in long-term health and lower lifetime health care costs. If it comes to health care rationing. The least efficient move is to close the doors of the system to those who can't afford insurance. The smarter move is to put all Americans into insurance systems designed to assure appropriate quality care and contain costs systematically. Without an organized insurance program, we don't know when, where and why care is delivered, and there is no way to manage health care costs. **********America doesn't need a monolithic, Government-run health care delivery system to accomplish universal access. The policy initiatives that Government could provide through legislative mandates for universal access and equitable financing are the tools that our private sector needs to cast its health care net further and wider. **********We now have a diverse and responsive health care delivery system, which, like the insurance industry, has been made fundamentally more efficient by the Government's and corporate America's appetite for cost-conscious health care. Efforts now expended in risk avoidance, cost shifting and paper shuffling, could be better directed at the competition among providers and insurers to deliver expanded benefits and quality care at affordable prices. **********That we should provide dignified access to health care for all Americans is compelling and its political ripeness is apparent. But if we strip away the rhetoric, we find a dollars and cents issue that makes hard sense for the business community."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/10/world/arafat-says-jordan-didn-t-consult-him-on-west-bank-move.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Says Jordan Didn't Consult Him On West Bank Move", "print_headline": "Arafat Says Jordan Didn't Consult Him On West Bank Move", "body_text": " **********In his first comments on Jordan's decision to sever ties with the Israeli-occupied territories, Yasir Arafat expressed anger today that King Hussein had not consulted him and that other Arab countries had not informed him of the King's plans. **********Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, also indicated that Arab countries had not met commitments to extend millions of dollars in aid to the P.L.O. to support the Palestinian uprising that began in the territories last December. He said such commitments were made at a summit meeting in Algiers in June. Jordan's Motives Questioned **********In an interview published today in the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, Mr. Arafat questioned Jordan's motives in announcing its moves now, but said he would refrain from commenting further ''out of care not to cause an explosion in relations with Jordan.'' **********In a series of announcements at the end of last month and early this month, Jordan said it was severing financial and administrative links to the occupied territories, and cut off the partial or full salaries paid to about 21,000 teachers, health workers, civil servants and other workers in the West Bank, and a smaller number in the Gaza Strip. **********While the King said his moves were in deference to the P.L.O.'s claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians, he and other Jordanian officials have strongly implied that they doubt the ability of the P.L.O. to negotiate an Israeli withdrawal and expressed the belief that the Arab world would soon come to see that a comprehensive peace without Jordan is impossible. **********''We must signal that the P.L.O. was not consulted, nor was it officially informed even though it is the principal party affected by these measures, and taking into consideration that King Hussein contacted a number of Arab countries before taking these steps,'' Mr. Arafat said.  Mr. Arafat asserted that the P.L.O. could fill the void left by Jordan in the territories, but he appealed to Arab countries for financial help. **********''The P.L.O.'s structure is capable of absorbing everything,'' Mr. Arafat said, adding, ''I hope sincerely that I will be able in my next tour of Arab countries to execute the commitments which were agreed to in the Arab summit meeting of Algiers.'' Mr. Arafat said the Arab countries had agreed to pay $128 million immediately to the P.L.O. and $43 million monthly to support the uprising. **********But even during the Algiers meeting, Arab officials from the Persian Gulf region disputed similar assertions by Arafat aides. They said they had agreed only to negotiate the P.L.O.'s financial needs periodically as dictated by the circumstances of the uprising. **********Mr. Arafat is widely recognized in the Arab world as the leader of the Palestinian people. Several factions of the P.L.O., particularly those supported by Syria, oppose his leadership, and recently pushed his loyalists out of Beirut. **********But his power base is still strong; his group, Al Fatah, is the largest of the P.L.O. groups. Because of the divisions within the P.L.O., mostly over whether the organization should have a hard line or a moderate one regarding Israel, Mr. Arafat must maneuver carefully when he dealing with other Palestinians, Arab nations, or the West. **********Mr. Arafat said that he would now be willing to participate in an international peace conference on the Middle East as a part of a joint Egyptian-P.L.O. delegation, but he would not do so in partnership with Jordan. **********It was the first time Mr. Arafat had made such an assertion concerning Egypt, but it appeared to be more a spiteful response to King Hussein's spurning of an association with him than a realistic proposition; this is because in the context of negotiations the P.L.O. has far more in common with Jordan territorially than it does with Egypt. **********Mr. Arafat refused to say whether he supported the formation of a Palestinian government in exile - a step that many Arab diplomats and officials are urging, saying it would give the P.L.O. international recognition that would fill some of the void Jordan has left. Mr. Arafat said a decision on forming a government in exile was being studied. **********Palestinian officials in the past have suggested that such a move is opposed by many factions inside the P.L.O. Some Palestinians believe it would detract from the P.L.O.'s primary function: to fight a war of liberation. **********In Damascus today, the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, George Habash, said his organization, the second-largest Palestinian guerrilla group, endorsed the formation of a Palestinian government in exile. ''Our people need laws to govern their daily life,'' Mr. Habash said. ''This is why the creation of a government is needed.'' **********Mr. Arafat asserted that two of his senior advisers held meetings with the United States representative to the United Nations, Vernon A. Walters, although he was vague on the dates of these meetings.

Esrey, United Telecom's president and chief executive. **********U S Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., was formed by combining U S Telecom, the long-distance operation of United Telecommunications, and the GTE Sprint unit of the GTE Corporation into a venture owned jointly by the parent companies. **********Mr. Esrey said yesterday that the two companies had experienced some difficulty in trying to manage U S Sprint together and that the companies concluded that the long-distance carrier would be better run by one dominant owner. **********''It has been our longstanding goal to own more of U S Sprint,'' Mr. Esrey said. ''It's not that we didn't get along, but when you have a two-headed horse you often want to go in separate directions.'' **********Analysts said United Telecom would assume substantial risk in acquiring a majority stake in the money-losing U S Sprint, which is expected to continue to lose money through next year. **********United Telecom plans to finance the transaction with proceeds from the sale of its cellullar telephone operations to the Centel Corporation for $677 million. Faster Decisions Anticipated **********James L. Johnson, GTE's chairman and chief executive, said the agreement would be a ''win-win situation'' for both companies because it would allow U S Sprint to make faster decisions and thus build a market share faster and it would improve GTE's earnings. **********But analysts said GTE was cutting its losses in a business that it does not expect to be profitable soon. **********''U S Sprint has been a thorn in GTE's side,'' said John S. Bain, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. ''Its sale will take away a lot of risk and uncertainty and may even improve shareholder value in the long run.'' **********U S Sprint has spent about $2 billion to build a fiber optic network to distinguish its long-distance service as quality over its competitors. However, persistent problems with its computerized billing system have cut the company's revenues. **********Under the agreement, United Telecom would have the option until Dec. 31, 1995, of buying GTE's remaining 19.9 percent interest in U S Sprint at book value on Dec. 31 or at the time of exercise, whichever is higher. **********If United Telecom does not exercise its option, GTE would have the option of requiring United Telecom to buy its remaining interest at any time between Dec. 31, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1995, at book value. 100% Ownership Envisioned Mr. Esrey said United Telecom planned to acquire all of U S Sprint. **********United Telecom and GTE will continue to split the losses at U S Sprint 50-50 for the rest of this year, but United Telecom will assume control of the daily operations, according to the agreement. **********Analysts have predicted that U S Sprint would lose more than $80 million in the second quarter and about $350 million in all 1988. GTE and United Telecom plan to announce the second-quarter earnings tomorrow. **********Some analysts, like Charles Schelke of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, believe that U S Sprint is moving closer to profitability and that United Telecom's move is a good investment. **********Shares of United Telecom closed at $33.50, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. GTE's shares ended at $40, down 37.5 cents. **********Analysts said Mr. Snedaker's sudden departure from U S Sprint did not bode well for the company's future. Mr. Snedaker, a former vice chairman of United Telecom who is an operations specialist, replaced Charles M. Skibo as Sprint's president in July 1987. Mr. Snedaker was brought in to solve the company's computer billing problems and cut costs.  THE PROBLEMS AT U S SPRINT  July 1986: The GTE Corporation and United Telecommunications Inc. form the U S Sprint Communications Company, a 50-50 joint venture.  July 1987: Both GTE and United Telecommunications report lower earnings because of heavy U S Sprint losses. Sprint takes a $350 million pretax charge against second-quarter earnings. Robert H. Snedaker Jr. named president, succeeding Charles M. Skibo.  February 1988: U S Sprint reports 1987 pretax loss of $1.15 billion on $2.59 billion in revenues.  March 1988: U S Sprint reports $138 million pretax first-quarter loss on $759 million in revenues.  July 1988: GTE announces plans to sell its 60 percent stake in U S Sprint to United Telecommunications for more than $600 million. Mr. Snedaker also announces he will retire in August."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/14/business/the-media-business-live-from-detroit-the-big-three-on-tv.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1988-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Live, From Detroit, The Big Three on TV", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Live, From Detroit, The Big Three on TV", "body_text": " **********When the Ford Motor Company released its third-quarter earnings a few weeks ago, David N. McCammon, the company's treasurer, held a news conference to comment on the results. Instead of standing behind a lectern, as would be typical at such an event, he was wired for sound and sat casually in a chair facing a small group of journalists. **********That is because the real audience was 180,000 Ford employees watching his performance live on television in more than 270 factories and offices in North America. Like some other major corporations, Ford has begun to rely heavily on television to help build rapport among employees and to speed communications. **********''We don't want our people to be surprised when they read the newspaper the next morning,'' said John T. Caldwell, director of the company's internal communications office. ''We want them to feel involved in what's going on with the company.'' A Growing Network **********The broadcast is just one offering of the Ford Communications Network, as the system is called. It also carries a five-minute ''newscast'' twice a week, complete with an anchorman and field reporters. The plan is to have a daily broadcast by the end of the year, produced completely in-house. **********In between live or recorded video events, messages about Ford and the auto industry are displayed. Meanwhile, the stock prices of the Big Three companies crawl across the bottom. The monitors are placed where workers gather for meals and meetings. **********While Ford has concentrated on internal communications, other car companies and a private network have begun to harness the power of satellite communications to reach farflung dealer organizations. **********The Chrysler Corporation recently announced the formation of the Pentastar Satellite Communications Network, intended to link the company's 6,000 dealers with its headquarters in Highland Park, Mich. Over the next two years the company, in conjunction with a Hughes Aircraft subsidiary, plans to install at the dealerships satellite dishes capable of two-way data communications and of receiving video transmissions. **********Orders for cars and parts, service bulletins and so forth now go out over telephone lines, with the cost depending on the amount of use. The dishes will encourage more use by reducing the cost of communication. **********''We want to be much more on-line with our dealers,'' said G. N. Simonds, Chrysler's director of management information systems. ''For them to give better service to customers requires more connectivity back to Chrysler.'' **********For example, the complete service history of each car the company makes will be kept in computer files at Chrysler headquarters. That way, when a car that has changed hands several times is brought into a dealer for service, the dealer can call up information on previous repairs through the satellite link. The Automobile Network **********The company is considering an affiliation with the Automobile Satellite Television Network. Founded by Carl Wescott, a Dallas-area auto dealer, in September 1986, ASTN now broadcasts a mix of training, motivational and news programs to more than 4,000 dealers. **********The General Motors Corporation's Electronic Data Systems subsidiary pumped in $10 million so ASTN could buy expensive production equipment and owns 30 percent of its equity. **********G.M. itself now sends out a twice-weekly news program, ''Information Line,'' over ASTN, with the signals coded so they can be picked up only by G.M. dealers. (Several Toyota distributors make announcement the same way.) And starting next year, G.M. plans to use the system to distribute training programming tailored to the company's products, rather than the more generic training offered by ASTN. Wider Use Expected **********About 1,600 G.M. dealers, including many of its largest, now subscribe to ASTN for $385 a month, and G.M. officials expect more to sign up as the individual car divisions start using satellite communications for sales and technical training. **********''I'm confident that the divisions will talk to dealers by satellite,'' said Richard A. Herdegen, who produces the G.M. ''Information Line'' program. ''When you put the face of the general manager on the screen, it provides much more immediacy than a piece of paper or a fax.'' **********G.M. is also using television for internal communications, although with less fervor than Ford. Video monitors have been installed in many new plants, but G.M. does not have the 100 percent employee coverage insisted upon at Ford."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/05/world/pope-picks-high-level-group-to-go-to-moscow-church-fete.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1988-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pope Picks High-Level Group To Go to Moscow Church Fete", "print_headline": "Pope Picks High-Level Group To Go to Moscow Church Fete", "body_text": " **********The Vatican announced today that Pope John Paul II, hoping to open ''new paths'' for peace in the world, had named a delegation to attend a major religious celebration in Moscow that will be the largest group of Roman Catholic Church leaders ever to visit the Soviet Union. **********The celebration in early June will mark the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity's arrival in what is now Soviet territory.

But it did so in rival ceremonies that underscored the rift that has deepened among the 2.5 million Afrikaners over the direction that South Africa must take to survive. President Urges Conciliation **********During the Government-sponsored ceremony at the Voortrekker Monument outside Pretoria, President P. W. Botha asked Afrikaners to seek conciliation with the other races of South Africa. ''On Dec. 16, 1838, there were white, brown and black people in the laager at Blood River, irrespective of those who today try to deny this in their attempts to justify their current attitudes, '' Mr. Botha told a placid crowd, some of whom had hidden behind umbrellas from the summer sun. **********''This cooperation across group boundaries did not limit anybody's identity or ideals,'' Mr. Botha said. ''It is the basis upon which we must also pursue cooperation today.'' **********But at a farm outside Donkerhoek, 25 miles eastward, an altogether different view of history was celebrated by a far larger, more spirited crowd. They saw the Battle of Blood River as a lesson for South Africa's white minority. **********The Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht, addressing those he called his ''brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ,'' assured them that God meant South Africa's races to stay apart. And Eugene Terreblanche, head of the A.W.B., as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement is known, declared that ''the Afrikaner cannot afford to let what is his be taken away.'' **********He told his followers to ''be ready physically and militarily just as we were at Blood River.'' 'They're Liberals' **********Abrie Viljoen, a backer of A.W.B., crashed the official ceremony today with a couple of khaki-clad friends to display the red, white and black A.W.B. flag with its swastika-like emblem. When asked why he refused to join the ceremony, Mr. Viljoen gestured contemptuously toward the crowd that had just heard President Botha. ''They're liberals,'' he said. **********President Botha hardly sounded liberal in his depiction of the Afrikaners as a nation confronting a malevolent world. ''The head of our people is demanded on a silver platter so the devilish spirit of terrorism and the greed of others for the rich resources of our country can be satisfied,'' the President said. ''Our blood is sought and our demise is planned so that we can be offered as a scapegoat in atonement for other countries' sense of guilt for centureies of injustice.'' **********But Mr. Botha, who has promised to dismantle apartheid some day, also said that ''unity that should be built on healthy intergroup relations, on the principle of good neighborliness between all communities of our population, on love for the fatherland.'' **********The alternate festivities on the rolling farmland at Donkerhoek a feisty crowd. More than 15,000 listened to Mr. Treurnicht and Mr. Terreblanche thank God that Afrikaners were not as other men are. Some celebrants decked themselves out in the floppy hats and beards or the sunbonnets of the orginal pioneers, but more wore paramilitary uniforms of the A.W.B. **********''This land belongs to the Boers,'' said a celebrant, Casper Gouws. ''We've fought for it.'' **********Though the Government turned out fewer followers for its rally, most Afrikaners just took the day off for themselves.

Two American workers, panting from their exertions on an assembly line, turn to each other and say, ''I guess we just can't keep up with the Japanese.'' Only when they drink a Japanese health tonic can they go on. **********A new undercurrent is running through Japanese feelings about America - born of pride in Japan's new might, resentment of American pressures about trade and defense and uncertainty about Japan's role in a world that does not include an all-powerful United States. Other Side of Japan's Rise **********Japanese see a United States profoundly different than the one they were taught to revere and emulate after World War II. In Japanese eyes, the United States is unable to tame its budget and fiscal deficits and is eager to blame Japan for problems that were made in America. While Americans are only now beginning to debate whether their nation is in decline, many Japanese already take that decline for granted. **********''You've been very slow in recognizing your decline,'' said Masahiko Ishizuka, who edits the English-language Japan Economic Journal and has written extensively about the relationship between Japan and the United States. ''You have a trade deficit and a huge external debt. This has been the most obvious sign of the decline of American power. Now Japan and the United States are in a unique situation. America's decline is the other side of the coin of Japan's rise.'' **********As Japanese wrestle with the implications of their new status, their changing views of the United States are breeding what some call arrogance and others defend as justifiable self-assertion. **********''Other countries tell us, 'You are a big boy now,' and that's news to us,'' said Kuniko Inoguchi, associate professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. ''After decades of being told that you are a defeated, impoverished nation -and we believed it - you have to allow for the excitement of a country that has recovered and become a real economic power. We are in a transition period, of surprise, joy and bewilderment about our new situation.'' Surge in Value of Yen **********The turning point in the Japanese perception of America, Ms. Inoguchi and Mr. Ishizuka agree, has been the surge in the yen's value, pushed up, ironically enough, by the United States as a way to reverse its trade deficit with Japan. **********But as Japanese realized they were able to bankroll the American budget deficit, buy choice real estate and prime American companies, and snap up Hermes scarves and Louis Vuitton bags at bargain prices in yen terms, they began to see Japan as a rising power and America as a declining one. **********For young Japanese, who have only known a strong Japan, the thought that they should look up to the United States is an alien one. ''I think the older generation, even my own father, has an inferiority complex about foreigners,'' said Nami Matsuko, a university student. ''I don't think our generation feels that way any more.'' **********That is not to say that the Japanese see an America in ruin. Every person interviewed for this article insisted that the United States is still a vital nation, with unchallenged military power, the world's largest economy, an affluent lifestyle and natural abundance - qualities that still awe resource-poor Japan. Yet the Japanese find evidence of American power ebbing while Japanese financial might swells. American Quality Faulted **********Japanese confidence in American prowess was first shaken by a decline in the quality of certain American products. Now many Japanese assume that many American goods are poorly made and that Americans do not sell enough in Japan not because of Japanese trade barriers, but because of American incompetence. American businessmen say that legitimate complaints about trade barriers are often met by lectures on quality control and Japanese management. **********''The quality of most American products is rather poor compared to Japanese products and even those of the newly industrializing countries,'' said Hajime Karatsu, one of Japan's foremost authorities on quality control and an engineer who helped rebuild Japanese manufacturing after World War II. ''I am quite sad, because of all the things we are doing today, we learned almost all from the Americans. I tell young product engineers that America is still good, but they don't believe me.'' **********The image of American society also suffers by comparison with Japan, a nation with universal literacy, a low reported crime rate and services that work. Japanese have learned to shy away from publicly placing the blame for these problems on American minority groups - as former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone discovered when he attributed low American literacy levels to the presence of minorities. But many Japanese in casual conversations assert that Japan owes much of its success to its cultural homogeneity. 'Blame Thy Partner' **********''Japanese are also coming to realize that it will be very difficult for Americans, living in a society in which there are a large number of different races and ethnic groups that have to live together,'' said a Japanese writer who has lived in the United States. ''We suspect this might be reflected in the quality of your products, in the difficulties you have in managing things.'' **********The Japanese detect another symptom of decline in American complaints about Japanese trade practices and about the burdens of paying for Japanese defense. These complaints alternately puzzle and anger Japanese, who remember a time when the United States seemed rich and confident enough not to bother with such issues. **********''The United States's 'blame thy partner' trade policy is really very costly,'' said Makoto Kuroda, who stepped down this month as the trade ministry's senior negotiator. ''The only possible explanation to us is that maybe the United States is becoming weaker, and that may be the reason you have become so frustrated.'' **********But as Japan's self-confidence grows, so does resentment of American criticism, leading to startling departures from customary reticence. **********Hajime Tamura, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, told Japanese reporters recently that he suspected an element of racism behind the American debate on an omnibus trade bill. Sadanori Yamanaka, a senior legislator who is Japan's leading expert on tax reform, exploded during a press conference a year ago as he criticized foreigners for threatening Japan in order to extract trade concessions. ''I want to send this message,'' he said. ''At long last, Japan is awake. Japan's eyes are opened. At long last, Japan is on its feet. And bluffs in negotiations will no longer work.'' Less Affection for U.S.  Tensions about American Japan-bashing appear to be draining a huge reservoir of Japanese affection for the United States. A poll taken by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun found that the percentage of Japanese who believed that relations between the two nations were good fell to 36 percent in 1987, from 48 percent in 1986. **********The changing Japanese image of the United States is also prompting a debate about a new order in world affairs, in which the United States can no longer dictate policy but will share power and the economic costs of leadership with a group of nations that includes Japan. **********Slowly and tentatively, prodded along the way by other nations who want Japan to use its wealth to contribute more to the world, Japan is assuming a higher profile. At the economic summit meeting in Toronto, Japan touted a debt plan for developing nations that differed from the American proposal - an extraordinary departure from its follow-the-leader stance. And Japan will soon surpass the United States as the world's largest donor of foreign aid. **********But Japanese, by and large, are not gloating about their new power. Indeed, many Japanese say that they want the United States to remain strong, because Japan has yet to come to terms with how to exercise its new power.

Reputation for Wildness **********The son, Uday Hussein, 24 years old, had been the object of rumor and gossip in Baghdad for years. Western diplomats said he had a reputation for wild behavior in nightclubs and at Iraq's few pleasure resorts. **********His father promoted him in public office, appointing him head of Iraq's Olympic Committee and soccer federation. As chairman of the Olympic Committee, one of his first actions last year, as reported by Baghdad newspapers, was to have himself awarded an Olympic medal by his second-in-command, a close associate of his father. **********Despite the rumors, President Hussein had shielded his son. Since he came to power in 1979, his rule has been rooted in the close-knit loyalties of minority Sunni Muslims from the Takrit area north of Baghdad, including his own family. **********It is not clear whether the President's announcement cloaked other motives in the conspiratorial world of Iraqi politics. **********The Baghdad radio quoted the President as saying his son had tried three times to commit suicide since the killing of a presidential guard on Oct. 18. **********Iraqi newspapers said the younger Mr. Hussein was jailed on Oct. 21 after the killing of the presidential guard, Kamel Hanna Jajjo, who was said to have died after being struck on the head with a stick. Some accounts said the man had died after being beaten over the head with an iron bar.

Office May Be Upgraded **********As President, Mr. Gromyko, 78 years old, is the head of state. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has proposed to transform the position into one of genuine power. **********The personal attack was the dramatic high point of a day in which delegates railed against the backwardness of the Soviet economy and continued a passionate debate over the role of the press. **********The outpouring of complaints drew an angry, half-hour rebuke from Mr. Gorbachev, who implored the delegates to focus on the major political reorganization that is supposed to be the main business of the meeting. **********''I will tell you outright: If we do not reform the political system, all our initiatives, the whole massive task we have undertaken, will grind to a halt,'' he said. New Chief of Ideology **********The third day of the party conference was marked by a continued breakdown of traditional formality that began Wednesday, including these events: *********** The Byelorussian party leader disclosed at a news conference that Mr. Gorbachev's closest ally, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, now holds the key ideology portfolio. This appeared to confirm reports that Yegor K. Ligachev, the favorite of party conservatives, has relinquished this important assignment. *********** Mr. Gorbachev rebuked one of his top economic advisers for having too little faith in the Communist system. *********** A Moscow delegate demanded that Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted Politburo member and former Moscow city party chief, be allowed to tell the conference the story of his internal battles in the party's top ranks. The delegate, German Zagainov, also called for disclosure of party officials' perquisites and privileges. ''We know more about Reagan's income and the British royal family budget,'' Mr. Zagainov said to laughter and applause. *********** One delegate, the editor of the magazine Ogonyok, said he had evidence that the conference delegation from Uzbekistan included four delegates under investigation for bribery. **********Highlights of the meeting, including the boldest remarks, have been broadcast on Soviet television, and what appear to be comprehensive reports of the speeches are being printed in the newspapers. **********The most dramatic surprise came when Vladimir I. Melnikov, a party official from the Ural Mountains region, called for the removal of holdovers from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev, the former party leader whose 18-year rule is now called ''the period of stagnation.'' **********''Those who were active in the past pursuing the policy of stagnation cannot remain and work in the central party and government organs,'' Mr. Melnikov said. **********Mr. Gorbachev, sitting behind the lectern, interrupted to ask: ''Maybe you have some concrete proposals? We sit here and do not know, do you mean me or him?'' **********Mr. Melnikov answered without hesitation: ''I would refer, in the first place, to Comrade Solomentsev, to Comrades Gromyko, Afanasyev, Arbatov and others.'' **********The audience applauded, as Mr. Gromyko sat stonefaced on the podium. Mr. Gorbachev was impassive, but Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sat back abruptly in his chair, as if in disbelief. **********Mikhail S. Solomentsev is a Politburo member and head of the Party Control Committee, responsible for party discipline. Viktor G. Afanasyev is the chief editor of the party newspaper Pravda, and Georgi A. Arbatov is head of a leading foreign policy center, the U.S.A.-Canada Institute. Gromyko Is Defended **********Georgi K. Kryuchkov, a deputy on the staff of the party Central Committee, insisted that ''it would be incorrect to conclude that anybody will be pensioned off tomorrow on the basis of such criticism.'' **********Later, according to the press agency Tass, another delegate passed a note to the podium half-heartedly defending Mr. Gromyko as a beloved figure who had simply grown ''exhausted'' and started ''lagging behind'' because of the duties heaped on him. The note was also read on television tonight. **********A party spokesman said no one had risen to defend the other officials. **********Mr. Gromyko, a former Foreign Minister, is Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a largely ceremonial post equivalent to the head of state that is often referred to as President in the West. The political restructuring Mr. Gorbachev proposed on Tuesday would make this position one with broad powers over domestic and foreign policy. **********It is widely assumed that Mr. Gorbachev would assume the new post. More Immediate Concerns **********Although Mr. Gorbachev had identified the main task of the conference as remaking the Soviet Government, most of the delegates dwelt on the more immediate concerns: oppressive bureaucracy, severe shortages of food and housing, deterioration of the environment and the more aggressive role of the press. **********''The workers ask directly, where is perestroika?'' said Veniamin A. Yarin, a steel mill operator from Nizhni Tagil, a town in the Ural Mountains. ''The situation is the same with food in the shops, except for the addition of sugar rationing coupons. Meat is still unavailable, as it has been for a long time. Industrial goods have disappeared somewhere.'' **********''Understand me correctly,'' he added. ''I'm not saying this to build up tension, but to convey to the delegates the pain that tortures all the workers.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev, exasperated by the fact that the conference was paying little attention to his proposal for a sweeping political restructuring, pleaded with the delegates to turn from economic grievances to the main business of the conference. Economic Adviser Chastised **********The Soviet leader sharply chastised one of his closest economic advisers, Leonid I. Abalkin, who on Tuesday focused on flaws in Mr. Gorbachev's economic program and stressed the need for a competition of political ideas. **********''Can we, while retaining the Soviet organization of society and the one-party system, insure a democratic organization of social life?'' Mr. Abalkin asked. ''Yes or no? And if so, how?'' **********Mr. Gorbachev said his adviser's comments ''reeked of economic determinism'' and reflected a lack of faith in the Communist system. **********Only one aspect of Mr. Gorbachev's political plan has been subjected to serious debate. Delegates split sharply over his proposal that local party leaders be automatically nominated to run the elected government councils that are intended to become new centers of political power. **********Critics said this seemed to contradict Mr. Gorbachev's basic purpose of removing the party from the daily business of governing the country, The disclosure that Mr. Yakovlev is in charge of party ideology came from Yefrem Y. Sokolov, the party chief of Byelorussia, who seemed to invite the question during a news conference with Byelorussian delegates. Authority Less Clear **********Until Mr. Yakovlev was promoted to the Politburo a year ago, Mr. Ligachev appeared to be the senior ideologist, overseeing the party line on culture, history and current events. Since then the lines of authority have become less clear. **********Mr. Ligachev, a conservative, is considered the No. 2 party official. He heads the party Secretariat, which runs the day-to-day affairs of the party. Mr. Sokolov said he was responsible mainly for ''organizational work,'' which means personnel. **********It is not known when the ideology job passed to Mr. Yakovlev, or whether it was taken away from Mr. Ligachev as the result of some offense or simply to share the workload. **********Twenty speakers were given the podium today. In the first three days, the conference has heard only 44 of the 261 delegates who have signed up to speak, indicating that it is likely to extend into the weekend."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/15/world/struggle-in-burma-focuses-on-army.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1988-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 895, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRUGGLE IN BURMA FOCUSES ON ARMY", "print_headline": "STRUGGLE IN BURMA FOCUSES ON ARMY", "body_text": " **********As mass demonstrations and attempts at political consolidation by the Burmese opposition reportedly continued today, a struggle was under way for the allegiance of the armed forces, the nation's most powerful institution. **********The military so far has stood by the embattled Government, even though the opposition now enjoys the support of many local administrations, several Government departments, Government-controlled newspapers and most of the nation's embassies abroad. **********But the defections of several hundred soldiers last week, persistent rumors about the loyalty of the navy and air force, and statements by Government officials in the past few days indicate that fissures may be appearing in the military's loyalty to the Government. Opposition Appeals to Military **********They are fissures that the political opposition seems to be trying to foster, with appeals to soldiers and with what appear to be instances of faulty information about defections. **********Clearly acknowledging that this is having some effect, the Defense Minister and Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Saw Maung, appealed to the opposition this week, saying, ''Please do not try to break up the defense forces.'' **********Burma's 180,000-man army is a lightly armed, well-disciplined force hardened by years of battles with ethnic insurgents. Until last August, it took pride in the fact that it was the security police and not the army that had turned its guns on protesters. **********But when soldiers shot into crowds of unarmed demonstrators led by students from Aug. 8 to Aug. 12, killing, by unofficial estimates, hundreds and even thousands of people, the army appears to have recoiled at what it did. **********Since then, the military has held its fire, and some diplomats say they believe that, apart from controlling looters, commanders have refused to fire at civilians. Difficult for Military to Act **********U Aung Gyi, a leading opposition figure with good military contacts, said, ''The rest of the officers and enlisted men do not like the way the students were killed.'' A Western diplomat in Rangoon said public anger at the killings had made it difficult for the military to step in as a savior as the situation deteriorates with increasing lawlessness and a breakdown in services. **********General Saw Maung acknowledged this, saying his soldiers had remained passive at a time of national hardship because ''we believe that untoward incidents can arise even if they do intervene with good will.'' **********Apart from its military discipline, the armed forces have also been a highly politicized organization since U Ne Win, who resigned as Burmese leader last July, took office in a military coup in 1962. **********Soldiers and former soldiers virtually monopolize the top echelons of the Government and ruling party and dominate the civil service and Government-run enterprises. **********Indeed, to a large extent, the military is the ruling party. **********The men whose names are mentioned when protesters talk hopefully of a military coup are two of Mr. Ne Win's closest associates, General Saw Maung and his deputy, Lieut. Gen. Than Shwe.  Short of a top-level defection, however, Government and military leaders are clearly worried about the loyalty of individual commands and of the men themselves. Military's Neutrality Pledged **********It was Mr. Maung Maung who first raised this worry publicly last Saturday when he announced that multiparty elections would be held, ending the 26-year monopoly on power held by Mr. Ne Win's party. **********''The defense forces will not lobby for any party in these elections,'' he said, addressing a central concern of the opposition, whose victory would mean a diminishing of the military's privileged position in society. **********He added, ''No other parties should try to undermine the unity of these defense forces and their loyalty to the state.'' **********Five days earlier, a prominent opposition figure, U Tin Oo, a former Defense Minister and Army Chief, had called on soldiers ''to side with the people in the current peaceful revolution for democracy.'' **********On the same day, about 500 navy and air force men joined the demonstrators in the streets, shouting, ''We side with democracy and not with fascists.'' **********In addition, diplomats cited reports, which they described as reliable, that the Northwest Command in Mandalay had reached an accommodation with the students and Buddhist monks who have taken over administration of the nation's second largest city. It was not clear to what extent this implied support for the protesters or simply an avoidance of confrontation. **********General Saw Maung, the military chief, betrayed his concern over the loyalty of his men this week when leaflets appeared in the capital city of Rangoon warning that the navy and air force would attack administration buildings if the Government did not resign. **********No such attacks followed, and the anonymous leaflets appeared to be bogus. But diplomats in Rangoon were struck by the response of General Saw Maung, who addressed the nation on radio, pleading for military unity. **********''Please do not engage in organizational efforts, persuasions, enticements and allegations to disintegrate the defense forces,'' he said, addressing the political opposition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/06/world/cleric-in-lebanon-urges-mercy-for-us-captives.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1988-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cleric in Lebanon Urges Mercy for U.S. Captives", "print_headline": "Cleric in Lebanon Urges Mercy for U.S. Captives", "body_text": " **********The spiritual leader of a pro-Iranian group believed to be associated with the kidnappers of Americans and other foreigners in Lebanon said today that the captives must not be made to suffer for the downing of an Iranian airliner by a United States warship in the Persian Gulf. **********''I find no justification for making the hostages account for a matter to which they are not connected,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah was quoted as saying by the leading Beirut daily, An Nahar. **********He was answering a question on whether the downing of the Iran Air plane and the deaths of the 290 people on board would have a bearing on 20 foreign nationals, including 9 Americans and 3 Britons, seized by pro-Iranian Shiite militants in Lebanon.

Khrushchev's diaries, published today by the weekly magazine Ogonyok and translated by The New York Times. The narrative deals with the 1964 ouster of the author's father as Soviet leader and begins with Nikita S. Khrushchev and the Soviet President, Anastas I. Mikoyan, seated in the rear of the leader's plane after being summoned urgently back to Moscow from his Black Sea retreat. **********Father did not like to be alone, and while riding in the tail he would always invite his travel companions to ride with him. He would discuss something with his aides, proofread the shorthand texts of his speeches or simply talk. **********This time it was different. **********''Leave the two of us alone,'' he snapped. **********. . . A stewardess carried a tray with a bottle of Armenian cognac, mineral water and some snacks to the rear compartment. But in a minute she returned, carrying everything back. They were apparently not in the mood. **********. . . In the rear compartment, which was closed off from everyone else, the two men planned their line of behavior, played out different scenarios and tried to guess what awaited them ahead at Vnukovo-2 Airport. **********A warm reception? Hardly. An airport surrounded by troops? Even less likely. These were different times. But something was certainly lying in wait. **********. . . The airplane taxied up to the Government pavillion at Vnukovo-2. The engines were cut, and silence set in. Below there was no one. The space in front of the airplane was empty; however, far off in the distance loomed two figures. From the airplane it was impossible to tell who they were. Not a good sign. **********In recent years Central Committee Presidium members would come in large groups to meet and see father off. He would pretend to knit his brows, call the greeting party ''loafers'' and growl, ''What do you think? I can't find the way without you?'' But it was evident that such receptions pleased him. **********But now there was no one below. **********The gangway rolled up slowly, the mysterious figures following closely behind.

The others filed behind him. **********Semichastny walked up to father and greeted him courteously, but with reserve: **********I'm glad you've arrived safely, Nikita Sergeyevich.'' **********Then he leaned toward father and said under his breath, rather confidently, ''Everyone has gathered in the Kremlin. They are waiting for you.''  After the Oct. 13 evening Politburo meeting, which paved the way for his ouster the next day, a despondent Nikita Khrushchev returned home and was met by his son. **********Father arrived home at around 8 o'clock in the evening.

Each time I would try to learn from father what had happened at that final meeting of the Presidium he would rebuff me. And only at the very end of his life was I able to piece together from disjointed, fragmentary statements made by my father a more or less creditable picture of what he himself said in his last speech. **********My father said at the Presidium meeting that he was not about to engage in a power struggle since he considered it impossible to go against the opinion of a majority. He had talked of the role of the party and the necessity to preserve the unity of its ranks, which would have been impossible had there been a power struggle in the highest echelons of the leadership. **********He apologized for any tactless behavior or rude statements he might have made about other members of the Central Committee Presidium or Secretariat, saying that anything can happen at work, but that he did not absolve himself of blame for these failings. **********However, he decisively swept aside the main accusations presented against him. My father rebuked his former colleagues for their lack of audacity - none of them had ever tried to force father to be critical of his own actions or decisions, they all had vied with one another to say yes and totally agreed with his proposals.  After the meeting of the Central Committee on the morning of Oct. 14, at which he was formally ousted, Nikita Khrushchev took a walk with his son. **********Finally I could no longer stand the silence and asked him a question that interested me. **********''Who did they appoint?'' **********''Brezhnev's going to be the First Secretary, and Kosygin the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Kosygin is a worthy candidate. Back when we removed Bulganin I had proposed him for this post. He knows the national economy very well and will cope with the job. **********''As for Brezhnev it's more difficult to say. He has too soft a character and gives in to other people too much. I don't know whether he'll have the strength to conduct a correct line. Well, this no longer concerns me. I'm now a pensioner, an outsider.'' **********Bitter folds appeared at the corners of his mouth.

It occurs as the nation is groping to find an appropriate balance between unbridled free enterprise and constricting regulation, between short-term gains and long-term prosperity, between papering over deep economic problems and devising substantial solutions to them. **********By itself, the Drexel settlement, which represents the culmination of two years of the Government's investigation into wrongdoing by one of Wall Street's largest, most profitable firms, probably would not tip the balance of that debate in one direction or another. But Drexel is not an isolated incident. **********It is part of a continuum of questionable behavior in the financial arena that starts with names like Ivan F. Boesky, Boyd L. Jefferies, Martin A. Siegel and Dennis B. Levine - cases where illegality has been established - and ends with names like RJR Nabisco, F. Ross Johnson and Henry R. Kravis, where the ''indictment'' is for greed and excess. **********Without a doubt, many critics of deregulation will pounce on the Drexel episode as proof that Wall Street is out of control and that much more regulation is needed. But others will argue that to do so would jeopardize many of the gains that have come from liberalizing the financial markets: the new products that have helped corporations lower their cost of raising capital, the broader array of securities available to investors, and the benefits to the economy from both of these. **********''People should not lose perspective and put down a whole securities industry,'' said Robert J. Birnbaum, former president of the New York Stock Exchange Indeed, many lawyers and investment bankers point to the host of securities-fraud cases that have surfaced in the past two years as proof that the financial services industry can regulate itself. As Mr. Birnbaum recalled, the trail that led to Mr. Boesky began with an anonymous letter sent to Merrill Lynch & Company. ''They could have thrown it in a waste basket but they didn't,'' he said. **********In the wake of the Boesky scandal, Wall Street firms have been devoting substantially more time and energy to tightening up their compliance practices and to making sure their personnel policies mirror their stated ethical goals. ''One senior officer of an investment bank told me recently that his No. 1 job is trying to spot the amoral brilliant technicians in his firm and making sure they don't get into a position of power,'' said Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. **********Others note that the Securities and Exchange Commission's computerized system for monitoring securities trading already is doing a good job of turning up questionable patterns. Organizations like the New York Stock Exchange are allocating considerably more resources to their monitoring capabilities. And Congress this year passed a tougher insider-trading bill that made securities firms liable for failing to supervise employees properly and that sharply increased penalties for criminal violations. **********''The tools are adequate to deal with the problem,'' said Thomas A. Russo, a partner at the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a former official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulator of the commodities industry. **********Many legal and financial observers see Drexel's settlement not as a failure of Wall Street but of society. The question they are asking is not whether Wall Street needs to be more aggressively policed but how to alter a value system that has fostered many of these transgressions. **********''We cannot expect any single profession to be holier than the rest of society,'' said Stephen Gillers, professor of law at New York University. ''To the extent that people feel that in the world-at-large it is O.K. to cut corners, they will continue to do it within their particular industry.'' **********As a result, the Drexel case may not trigger an outcry for stricter regulation. Instead, it could end up having more influence on seemingly unrelated policy issues, such as whether leveraged buyouts are good for the nation, whether the tax code should be changed to discourage the use of debt, and whether the Government should face up to the need to pay for closing insolvent savings and loan associations. **********''Drexel was not a good chapter in the history of Wall Street, but it is symptomatic of our short-run view of life,'' Mr. Russo said. **********Seen in this light, the Drexel case has become a symbol of much of what is good and bad about the current period of business history. It is a period marked by a love affair with the bottom line. That has sparked a surge of entrepreneurial energy that helped transform an aging industrial structure into a more vibrant and competitive one. **********Nowhere was this new ethos more pervasive than on Wall Street. Young financial wizards armed with arcane quantitative skills became the folk heroes of the day. They rocketed to the top as the financial markets exploded with activity, propelled by a host of newfangled securities. **********Drexel Burnham was the very embodiment of this brave new world. The upstart firm's main contribution was high-risk, high-yield ''junk bonds.'' They became the financial lifeline not only for burgeoning companies that had been scorned by traditional investors and banks, but also for takeover artists and leveraged buyout specialists. **********The junk bond market's chief protagonist, Michael R. Milken, was himself a young renegade who insisted on living in Beverly Hills, Calif., 3,000 miles from Drexel's corporate headquarters. In just a few years he made hundreds of millions of dollars for himself and millions for others and came to personify the firm's entrepreneurial flair. **********Yet if Drexel and Mr. Milken symbolize much of what has been refreshing and potent about the laissez-faire 80's, they also illustrate the dangers of letting a trend get carried to an extreme. Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to manipulating the marketplace, tricking a corporation into being taken over and cheating clients. **********Drexel, an also-ran at the beginning of the decade, grew its staff exponentially in just a handful of years, as did many other firms. But managing such rapid-fire growth has imposed a severe managerial strain on all of Wall Street. ''The firms are so big today. The Street's an almost anonymous place,'' said James D. Wolfensohn, chairman of the investment bank that bears his name. Employees often have no close or long-lasting relationships with their superiors and find it difficult to identify with any corporate ethos. **********The managerial problem this posed for Wall Street firms in the early 1980's was exacerbated by the huge profits they were enjoying. Large fees and bonuses created big temptations. Those firms that had the strongest culture and traditions before this process was unleashed have generally fared the best, but even they have had problems. **********''The traditional firms changed more slowly, often too slowly. But they still had some people preaching moderation,'' said Paul K. Kelly, president of Peers & Company, a New York merchant bank. But Drexel ''was a firm that was essentially created in the last 10 years. It didn't have a tradition.'' **********Drexel's and Wall Street's problems were made more acute by the fact that they coincided with unparalleled economic growth and an Administration in Washington that encouraged conspicuous consumption. ''This is a period in which big dollars equal big me. The sense of identification is what was on my W-2 last year,'' said Mr. Keith of Prudential. **********Yet soon the accumulation of wealth became so great that even it assumed a position of secondary importance. The game shifted to one of competitiveness. It was not a question of making more money than the doctor who lived next-door, but whether one scored against the four others on the Street who understood the intricacies of a new security or deal. **********Competitiveness, corporate America's watchword of the decade, became an obsession with no boundaries on Wall Street. The punishing hours, the multimillion-dollar bonuses, the celebrity status accorded to the top guns all helped to reinforce this. **********Somehow, in all the frenzy, the voices preaching moderation, asking the hard questions, were drowned out. **********There are some today who look upon the Drexel settlement, and the expected indictment of Mr. Milken, as a strangely positive development, reinforcing a restorative process that they maintain is already under way. **********In just the last year or so, many business and law schools have introduced courses in ethics - and some have required students to take them. ''Students coming out of law school today are substantially more aware of nuances of ethical issues than I was 20 years ago,'' said Professor Gillers of New York University ''That's a first step.'' **********In the corporate arena, managements and directors seem to be growing increasingly cognizant of the damage caused by an overly short-term focus, and of the need to pursue business strategies that emphasize productivity and competitiveness over the long haul. The attempt by executives of RJR Nabisco Inc. to buy the company and make themselves phenomenally rich in the process is likely to make directors more circumspect about lavishing rewards on management at the expense of shareholders. **********It also seems likely that the incoming Bush administration will be more willing than its predecessor to intervene in the marketplace. Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary who will remain in the job, has indicated his willingness to use the Federal tax code to create incentives for corporations to pursue longer-term strategies. And he has assigned some of his staff to come up with ways to encourage more savings, both at the individual and at the corporate level. There is also a move toward fashioning a long-lasting solution to the debt problems afflicting many developing countries. **********Congress has even taken a few constructive steps - like the tougher penalties for criminal behavior on Wall Street. And with the election behind it, some political analysts expect Congress to make a more concerted effort to reduce the budget deficit and to craft a realistic solution of the savings and loan industry's crisis. **********The media, too, may inadvertently be contributing to the subtle changes. Television's new stars seem to be more preoccupied with Pampers and strollers than with the themes of money and revenge that contributed to Dallas and Dynasty's great success. **********How deep do these actions go? Are people paying more than lip service to these changes? And will that be enough to alter fundamentally a value system that has long emphasized material wealth and self-aggrandizement over all else? **********''Maybe because of real concerns over the deficit and over falling behind with Japan, we'll be forced to deal with substance and get away from fluff,'' said Mr. Russo, the securities lawyer. ''Recent history would say no, but maybe times have changed. Maybe this time we can do it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/19/business/3d-world-s-prospects-called-poor.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1988-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3d World's Prospects Called Poor", "print_headline": "3d World's Prospects Called Poor", "body_text": " **********Investment and economic growth have contracted in debtor countries since the global debt crisis began in 1982, and living standards have staggered, the World Bank said today. **********More than that, prospects for any near-term improvements are bleak, said the bank, which commits nearly $20 billion a year to strengthen developing countries' economies. The giant lending institution delivered its sobering assessment in a report accompanying its updated world debt tables for last year. **********The report, which shows that total developing country debt grew by 6.25 percent last year, to $1.190 trillion, was the most pessimistic the bank has ever issued on the debt crisis.

Other Proposals Described **********Other debt relief proposals are briefly described without comment in the report. These run the gamut from an idea of Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, that creditors provide annual relief over a three-year period conditioned on a country's willingness to accept economic reforms, to one by Peter Kenen, a Princeton banker, and Felix Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, to create a new international agency to take over all debts owed to commercial banks. **********The list marks the first time the bank has given any formal recognition to debt-relief proposals. **********Some analysts said they thought the World Bank's assessment was too pessimistic. **********C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, criticized the study for failing to note the improvement that has taken place since 1982 in a ratio that shows the ability of debtor countries to earn interest and principal payments. **********He was referring to the ratio of interest payments to exports, which he said had fallen dramatically for all the major debtor countries in the last five years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/world/4-die-in-british-air-collision.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Die in British Air Collision", "print_headline": "4 Die in British Air Collision", "body_text": " **********Two Tornado jet fighters collided while on separate low-level night training flights, killing three British airmen and a West German trainee navigator, the Defense Ministry said today.

State and Federal measures that have been considered or put into effect in the last year include higher excise taxes, and requirements that labels disclose ingredients and provide warnings that alcohol can pose a health hazard. They would apply both to foreign and domestic wines sold in the United States. Sales Are Disappointing **********In recent years, sales of table wine have generally declined and sales of wines of all types - including coolers and sparkling wines - have been level. While wine makers say they do not see a direct connection between this stagnation and the various advocacy groups - which they call neo-prohibitionists - some vintners are nonetheless taking them as a serious threat. **********Still, they disagree about what their response should be. Some vintners think they should vigorously fight warning requirements, for instance. Others fear that such a strategy would be self-destructive and favor a focus on better wines that are consumed in moderation. **********In general, the wine industry is trying to distance itself from beer and spirits, calling attention to wine's role as an accompaniment to food rather than as a product for heavy recreational drinking. **********It is a tactic that carries little weight with the industry's critics. ''In general, alcohol is alcohol is alcohol,'' said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Washington. ''There are wine alcoholics. There are guys on Skid Row sucking on bottles of Wild Irish Rose.'' **********Mr. Jacobson disdained the neo-prohibitionist label and said he did not preach abstention. Still, because there is no effective way to lower just problem drinking, he added, a viable alternative is to lower consumption across the board. Toward that end, the center has lobbied for a Federal ban on advertising of alcoholic beverages and for higher excise taxes. **********But the center's major thrust has concerned chemical additives and contaminants in beer, wine and spirits. New Rule on Disclosure **********The center was active in the successful drive to force the wine industry to label its bottles with ''Contains Sulfites'' after the nearly ubiquitous preservative was found to cause severe allergic reactions in some asthma sufferers. That Federal regulation took effect in July. **********Most recently the center has published a list of alcoholic beverages, including wine, containing urethane, a carcinogen that is sometimes a byproduct of fermentation. And it has asked the Food and Drug Administration to ban products with large amounts of the chemical. **********Some wines also contain traces of histamines, a compound that can cause headaches or other allergic reactions in some people. **********''Our concerns are about health,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''If people are going to drink, it might as well be as safe as possible.'' A Modern 'Carry Nation' **********But John de Luca, president of the industry's lobbying organization, the Wine Institute, said the center was using scare tactics. ''Carry Nation's ax has been replaced by the public-health press release,'' he said. ''They've moved the charge from alcohol abuse to saying that the product itself is inherently dangerous.'' **********Mr. de Luca said vintners had voluntarily acquiesced to sulfite labeling and were looking for ways to eliminate urethane. **********While wine industry leaders often refer to European studies linking moderate wine consumption with reduced incidence of heart disease and colon cancer, most concede that such evidence is fragmentary and that conclusive research has not yet been done. An Appeal on Gracious Living **********In the absence of such data, Robert Mondavi, founder of a winery here that bears his name, said the industry must point to wine's historical role as part of a gracious way of living. He has begun what he describes as a mission to bring a group of anthropologists, priests, rabbis and physicians to five cities for an educational program on the safety and benefits of moderate wine consumption. **********''Wine has been with us since civilization began,'' Mr. Mondavi said in an interview. ''It's the temperate, sacred, romantic mealtime beverage recommended in the Bible. It's a liquid food that has been praised for centuries by rulers, philosophers, physicians, priests and poets for life, health and happiness.'' **********But Mr. Mondavi's appeal carries little weight with some health groups. Legislation pending in Massachusetts would require all alcoholic beverages to be labeled with a warning about the health hazards of alcohol. New Requirements in California **********Wine makers are particularly worried by the recent decision in California to apply provisions of Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, to alcohol. Because alcohol has been listed by the state as a toxin that may cause birth defects, the alcoholic beverage industry as of Oct. 1 will have to post warnings at every point of sale in the state or label bottles sold in California with a message that drinking may cause birth defects. **********Because the act requires that consumers be warned if a product contains even trace amounts of a substance ''known to cause cancer or birth defects,'' Mr. de Luca said, thousands of foods, from parsley to peanut butter, will have to carry warnings if the law is fairly enforced. He added that wine makers feared that such warning labels would precede an increase in excise taxes and the removal of wine advertisements from television. There is a legitimate issue regarding the effect of large amounts of alcohol on fetuses, ''but why implicate moderate behavior?'' he said. ''They are blurring the distinction between use and abuse.'' **********But some studies and a report by the Surgeon General have indicated that even moderate alcohol consumption can pose a risk to an unborn baby. And the lack of warning labels is a key issue in a first-of-its-kind product liability suit filed in Seattle in December by three couples contending that the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy led to their children's birth defects. Industry's Approach Criticized **********Jim Shultz, a policy analyst with Consumers Union in San Francisco, which sponsored Proposition 65, said the wine industry was burying its head in the sand by not acknowledging the health hazards from its product. That stance, he warned, could inflict unnecessary damage on the industry over the long haul. **********''I think Mr. Mondavi and Mr. de Luca's efforts are misplaced,'' he said. ''They are beginning to undermine the credibility of the industry and their product.'' **********Although no vintner has done so publicly, some people close to the wine industry agree that fighting labeling is damaging its image. At a recent conference at the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, Calif., Dr. David N. Whitten, a Mill Valley, Calif., physician who consults for wineries, urged wine makers to adopt voluntarily labels that reflect current health concerns. Such action, he said, would enable the industry to avoid being characterized ''as another of those industries in which the proponents are cynical servants of money.'' **********In an Oct. 31 editorial, Jim Gordon, managing editor of The Wine Spectator, an industry publication, wrote that ''the same forces that put tobacco on the road to extinction could also do it to wine, unless the wine industry changes its defensive stance to a friendly, helpful one.'' **********Mr. Gordon added, ''Undoubtedly there are some crackpots out to get alcohol, but there are a growing number of sane, responsible citizens who are demanding for health reasons to know exactly what they're eating and drinking.'' **********Some analysts say a movement from high-volume consumption of generic table wines to lower consumption of higher-priced varietals, which appears to be occurring naturally, may both limit wine's vulnerability to anti-alcohol sentiments and strengthen the industry's long-term growth prospects. **********''We think the key to solving wine makers' long-range problems is for them to totally separate themselves from other beverages,'' said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based beverage industry consulting firm. ''They must get away from overconsumption. A glass of wine is healthy and should be seen as a food, not a recreational beverage. If the wine industry is going to grow it will be as a premium business, a food business.'' **********Many vintners say they are already carrying out such a strategy, both in promotion and in production. One is Wine World Inc., the Nestle Company subsidiary that owns Beringer, Los Hermanos, Napa Ridge and other brands. ''If people are drinking, they're drinking better and drinking less,'' said E. Michael Moone, Wine World's president. ''The life style of somebody who enjoys a glass of wine with dinner is working for us. People drinking varietal wines is a better-based business than a glass of white wine across a counter.'' **********Others agree that the moderate consumption of more premium wines is where the industry's future lies. ''When people start waking up to the fact that wine in moderation is not harmful, neo-prohibitionism will pass,'' said Paul Schlem, chairman of Vintners International Inc., whose brands include Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars. ''We can overstate neo-prohibitionism, and cry wolf. It's a real irritant, but it's not the death knell of the industry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/24/business/whats-new-in-the-superconductivity-business-123-powders-at-105-to.html": {"writer_name": "Stanley Rich", "pub_date": "1988-01-24", "snippet": "LEAD: THE high-temperature superconducting ceramics have jumped out of the laboratory test tubes and into the commercial marketplace in less than a year after their discovery.", "word_count": 432, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN THE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY BUSINESS;\n1-2-3 Powders - at $105 to $2,000 a Kilo", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN THE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY BUSINESS;\n1-2-3 Powders - at $105 to $2,000 a Kilo", "body_text": " **********LEAD: THE high-temperature superconducting ceramics have jumped out of the laboratory test tubes and into the commercial marketplace in less than a year after their discovery. **********THE high-temperature superconducting ceramics have jumped out of the laboratory test tubes and into the commercial marketplace in less than a year after their discovery. **********About a dozen companies are now selling or test-marketing high-temperature superconducting materials for use by researchers seeking to make the promised applications come true. These materials contain the yttrium-barium-copper oxide compound - a mixture referred to in the industry as the 1-2-3 compound - that can become superconductive at minus 183 degrees Celsius, about the temperature of liquid nitrogen. **********Indeed, a virtual bazaar of products now exists. It is possible to buy the high-temperature superconducting ceramics in powder form, or pressed into disks or other special shapes.

''They think we've slowed down; we think they've slowed down. There is a rhythm to these negotations. They have a burst of activity, and there's a period of trying to consolidate the meaning of that activity.'' **********The two powers are trying to conclude an ambitious agreement on large cuts in their arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons so it can be signed when President Reagan goes to Moscow, in late May or early June, for his fourth summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Seen as 'Extremely Difficult' **********But American officials are hesitant to predict success. ''It's possible but extremely difficult,'' said Edward L. Rowny, a special adviser to the President on arms control. ''The Soviets are making it more difficult.'' **********Another official, speaking a few days ago of the negotiations being held in Geneva, said: ''Somehow, the atmosphere went a little flat. I guess we've been waiting for a start-up event, and this meeting this weekend is it.'' **********Mr. Shultz is going to Moscow for the first of three meetings over the next three months that he and the Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze have scheduled. And knowing how the Russians like to play an end game in their bargaining, a senior American negotiator said the first significant movement toward an accord might not come until Mr. Shevardnadze travels to Washington in late March. **********One of the most complex tasks, Mr. Shultz said, was to agree on a system of verifying compliance with an agreement. **********''Verification of a strategic arms treaty will be far more difficult than the intermediate range treaty, where we eliminated all of the weapons,'' he said. The difference lies in the fact that the strategic treaty would limit weapons to a certain number and some way of actually counting them will have to be found. **********By comparison, verifying a total elimination of weapons, as in the intermediate range treaty that was signed by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev in Washington in December, is ''child's play,'' Mr. Shultz declared. **********That treaty, for example, included a list of sites in each country to which the other could demand a visit on short notice. The strategic arms treaty will require each side to allow inspections of any site, not just those in a list. 'No Movement on Details' **********''While the Soviets agree with the concept,'' Mr. Rowny said, ''there is no movement on any details on that, which are going to be very messy.'' **********Verification problems have also led to disagreement on whether the treaty limits should apply to sea-launched cruise missiles and mobile, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. **********The Russians want the weapons covered. The Americans, arguing that such missiles cannot be counted, do not. The United States has cruise missiles but no mobile missiles, while the Soviet Union has mobile missiles but no long-range, nuclear cruise missiles. Consequently, the United States wants mobil missiles banned and cruise missiles left unrestricted. **********Mr. Shultz said the Russians have declared that ''they think it's not so difficult'' to verify these weapons. **********''So we've said, 'Well then, show us, because we think the problems are formidable.' '' he said. ''However, we've also been thinking about it ourselves, and we have our thoughts, and we will have to roll up our sleeves and get into this.'' 'Pick-and-Shovel Work' **********''So there is a lot of work to do.'' Mr. Shultz continued. ''This is something we're both going to have to put our backs into, and basically it's pick-and-shovel work. It's hard, tough pick-and-shovel work, and you've just got to do it and do it and do it.

William Seidman, F.D.I.C. chairman, in an announcement at an early morning news conference. Shareholders Could Suffer **********But the regulators stressed that the obligations of the parent holding company would not be guaranteed, raising the prospect that shareholders and creditors of the First Republicbank Corporation could see their investment wiped out. **********The action by the F.D.I.C. - the agency that insures deposits at the nation's commercial and savings banks - was described as a temporary measure taken until a permanent solution was found. **********The emergency bailout provides that, in exchange for the $1 billion cash infusion, the F.D.I.C. is given as collateral stock in 29 of First Republicbank's largest banks, representing 80 percent of the banks' total assets. Thus, the agency has effectively gained control over First Republicbank's operations. Concerns Are Eased **********In Texas, the F.D.I.C.'s move already appeared to be easing depositors' fears, which had heightened after First Republicbank reported a $347.8 million loss for the fourth quarter of last year. **********''Since the announcement by the F.D.I.C. this morning, the deposit outflows have stopped,'' Joseph C. Bowles, a spokesman for First Republicbank, said late this afternoon. ''The stability that we all wanted to see, and the principal reason we went to the F.D.I.C. for assistance, has been achieved.'' **********Though the F.D.I.C. said it was pumping in $1 billion as a short-term loan, officials conceded that a final resolution could involve much more money. Analysts have estimated that a long-term solution could cost as much as $3 billion. Ultimate Solution Could be Costly **********The bailout of First Republicbank could thus become the largest bank rescue on record, exceeding the 1984 bailout of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, which will end up costing the F.D.I.C. almost $2 billion. **********The emergency measure, which was agreed to late Wednesday, takes the F.D.I.C. far beyond its mandate, which is to insure deposits of up to $100,000. The agency has, however, in most cases found a way to insure that all depositors of a troubled bank, even those whose balances exceed the $100,000 limit, do not lose any money. **********The First Republicbank bailout could represent a considerable drain on the F.D.I.C., which has about $18 billion in assets, including $16 billion in cash, Mr. Seidman said he did not anticipate a substantial drain on the F.D.I.C. from the First Republicbank rescue, ''and by substantial I mean a drop of 25 percent,'' he said. A 25 percent drop would amount to more than $4 billion, so his statement leaves open the possibility that the rescue could cost $2 billion to $3 billion. **********In addition to the aid from the F.D.I.C., Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said at today's news conference that the Federal Reserve had been lending money to subsidiary banks of First Republicbank and would continue doing so for the indefinite future. **********''We have been providing liquidity for several days, and we will continue,'' he said, adding that all the lending to First Republicbank banks had been fully collateralized by loans and other assets. He said the banks had sufficient other assets so that they should be able to continue to borrow short-term funds from the Fed. **********Mr. Johnson, however, declined to say how much First Republicbank's banks had borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to meet heavy withdrawals by depositors from First Republicbank's units. Historically, Texas law has prohibited branch banks, and as a result large holding companies end up owning numerous small subsidiary banks that are separate corporate entities. $2 Billion Withdrawn Since the start of the year the $33.2 billion First Republicbank organization has lost nearly $2 billion in deposits, and the rate of withdrawals was accelerating as reports of its weakened condition spread. Finally, on Tuesday, the banking company's management announced that it had made a formal request for help to the F.D.I.C. **********First Republicbank, which has no connection to the First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, lost $656.5 million in 1987, primarily from bad real estate loans, and reported that it had a total of $4 billion in nonperforming loans. Analysts have been predicting that the bank could lose $450 million in 1988. **********The stock of First Republicbank, which traded as high as $26.50 last summer, ended today at $1.875, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Seidman said today that the problems of First Republicbank had been largely the result of the depressed Texas economy rather than mismanagement, as was the case, he contended, with Continental Illinois. **********''It is clear that the primary reason for this problem was the economy of Texas,'' Mr. Seidman said, stressing that the company's banks were not insolvent, but were experiencing severe liquidity problems. **********He said that there were currently no plans to remove the management of First Republicbank, as is often done when the agency intervenes, but he did not rule out that possibility. An Acquisition Last Year **********The trouble at First Republicbank comes less than a year after the F.D.I.C. and other bank regulators gave their blessing to the creation of First Republicbank through a $544 million acquisition of Interfirst Corporation by the Republicbank Corporation. Interfirst had for some time been troubled by bad energy loans, but Republicbank officials predicted that combining the two largest banking companies in Dallas would produce cost savings that could overcome the problems. **********Under the temporary bailout plan, the F.D.I.C. could now either take over or sell these banks, and shareholders in the parent holding company could see their holdings essentially wiped out. **********The F.D.I.C. action means that the banking company's executives will operate under a number of restrictions. **********The $1 billion injection of funds is in the form of a six-month note, bearing an interest rate of one-half of 1 percent above the six-month Treasury bill rate, which was about 5.73 percent today. Mr. Seidman said the note's duration indicated how long the agency thinks it might take to work out a permanent resolution of the banks' problems. Outside Investors Sought **********Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. was particularly interested in finding outside investors who would put up their own capital and take over the bank. If that happens, it would continue a trend established over the last year of large out-of-state institutions taking advantage of the troubled times in Texas and buying up many of the state's largest banking companies. **********Last year the Chemical New York Corporation bought Texas Commerce Bancshares of Houston and First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles bought Allied Bancshares Inc. More recently, the financier A. Robert Abboud has been trying to complete a $1.5 billion bailout package with the F.D.I.C. that would give him control of the First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc., which is based in Houston."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/business/mci-plans-a-separate-facsimile-network.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1988-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MCI Plans a Separate Facsimile Network", "print_headline": "MCI Plans a Separate Facsimile Network", "body_text": " **********Taking advantage of the boom in the use of facsimile machines, the MCI Communications Corporation said yesterday that it would offer to business customers a special network for transmission of facsimile messages. **********MCI said the network, called MCI Fax, would transmit facsimiles on fiber-optic lines to insure the quality of the images.

If all Senators participated in an override vote, 34 would have to oppose the bill to sustain a veto. **********The legislation is the top election-year priority of organized labor, and public opinion polls have found that more than 80 percent of those polled support it. The bill's passage by a majority of more than two-thirds in each chamber poses a major political challenge to President Reagan and Vice President Bush, who is certain to be the Republican Presidential nominee. Effect on Bush Campaign **********President Reagan is likely to be under pressure from the Bush camp to forgo a veto in the hope of defusing the issue before the November election. **********''At this point we can't say whether there will be a veto or not, but senior advisers are recommending one,'' said B. Jay Cooper, a White House spokesman. Another White House official said of the President, ''I think he'll veto it.'' **********President Reagan vetoed a broad trade bill on May 24, chiefly because it included the plant-closing provision. In his veto message, he said the requirement of 60 days' notice would cause the nation to lose jobs in a ''straitjacket of regulations.'' The business community has adamantly opposed the provision, calling it an unwarranted intrusion into business affairs. Trade Bill Also Passed **********After the veto, Democratic leaders removed the plant-closing provision from the trade legislation. The new trade bill was approved by the House today several hours after passage of the plant-closing measure. The Senate is expected to pass the trade bill next month.

If Mr. Reagan decides to veto it, the Administration and business lobbyists are certain to urge some members of Congress to switch their votes. **********Fifty-four Republicans joined 232 Democrats to back the plant-closing bill today, while 120 Republicans were joined by 16 Democrats, mainly from the South, where unions have less political influence, in opposing it. Business strategists expressed satisfaction with today's vote. **********''We think it was pretty good because we're within striking distance of sustaining,'' said Renee L. Reymond, director of human resources and legislative affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers. **********There are now 432 members of the House - three seats are vacant - so 145 votes would be needed to sustain a veto. That is nine votes more than opponents of the measure could muster today. **********In a veto-override vote, Ms. Reymond said, different dynamics come into play. The White House traditionally mounts enormous pressure on individual lawmakers to try to win their support. There was little evidence of White House lobbying in today's vote. President Has 10 Days **********A number of Republicans, in fact, spoke in favor of the bill and urged the President not to veto it - highlighting what seems certain to be a heated internal White House struggle before the President takes any action. **********Mr. Reagan has 10 days in which to veto the bill. Should he neither sign nor veto it in that time, it would automatically become law. **********One Republican who spoke in favor of the bill was the former chairman of the Corning Glass Works, Amo Houghton, now a Representative from upstate New York. He said: ''Let's not get hung up on our ideological high horse.

If not, Vice President Bush will have a problem on his hands in this campaign. I don't think this issue is worth that kind of political fight.'' **********Both the President and Mr. Bush have said they support the idea of companies voluntarily providing such notice but oppose requiring companies to comply. **********Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the certain Democratic Presidential nominee, has endorsed the Congressional bill. Present Version Modified **********Backers of the bill said it had been watered down greatly from earlier versions and would not put an undue burden on responsible businesses. **********Representative William Clay, Democrat of Missouri, said that the bill, for example, does not cover seasonal workers and exempts companies that are hit by natural catastrophes, including a drought. The provision also does not apply if workers are on strike. **********The bill covers employers of 100 or more workers and is applicable to the permanent closing of any work establishment or to layoffs affecting one-third of a work force or 500 or more workers. **********Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana, quoted from a 1986 Reagan Administration task force report that called notice to employees and communities a ''good practice'' and an ''important element in helping workers find new jobs.''

Brock, the Secretary of Labor at the time, was the head of that task force. **********But Representative Bill Frenzel, Republican of Minnesota, said he saw no evidence that this was an issue of ''burning intensity'' for the country.

Maloney, said the fine was believed to be the largest imposed on a corporation in a criminal consumer-fraud case. Fake Appraisals and Forgeries **********''Anyone who paid any money to Hertz for repairing a Hertz rental car during that period may be entitled to a refund,'' said Jonny J. Frank, an assistant United States attorney. The amounts, he added, could range from ''a few dollars to several thousand.'' **********In some instances, the Government contended, Hertz had illegally concealed from customers and their insurance companies that it had paid discounted wholsesale rates for car repairs, but had charged them retail rates for the same repairs. **********In other cases, generally involving small amounts of body damage, the company prepared fake appraisals, sometimes forging the signatures of legitimate appraisers, to collect money for repairs that were never made. 'Practices Are Industrywide' **********''This sends a warning to other car-rental companies,'' Mr. Maloney said. ''We do not believe the practice is limited to Hertz. We believe that some of the illegal practices are industrywide.'' **********He said some restitution would go to individuals for the inflated costs they had paid and some would go to insurance companies that had paid fraudulent claims for policyholders. **********Mr. Maloney said it was impossible to say how much money would go to individuals and how much to the insurers. A Hertz executive said 70 percent of the refunds would be for the insurers because they had paid for 70 percent of the inflated costs. **********At the same time, Hertz agreed to refund $2 million to 10,000 other customers and insurers who were overcharged for repairs, as a result of a civil consent judgment filed in New York and 40 other states. Robert Abrams, the Attorney General of New York, said the accord covered the period from June 1, 1985, to May 31, 1986, after the time in the criminal case. **********Amid reports of a Federal inquiry last January, Hertz - which has been owned by the Park Ridge Corporation of Park Ridge, N.J., since last Jan. 1 -admitted that it had for seven years charged motorists and insurance companies higher prices to repair rented cars damaged in accidents than it actually paid. During the period of the crimes, the RCA Corporation owned Hertz. The General Electric Company, which now owns RCA, said through a spokesman that the wrongdoing had occurred before it acquired RCA and that G.E., thus, had nothing to do with the case. **********Mr. Maloney, speaking at a news conference in his office, said the improprieties were committed by middle managers and low-level employees. 'We Move Fast' **********Yesterday, Mr. Maloney's office filed a criminal information accusing Hertz of mail fraud, because it had sent the fraudulent claims through the mail. Then, Hertz, waiving its right to be formally indicted and have a trial, pleaded guilty and was immediately sentenced in accordance with a prearrangement accepted by Judge Eugene H. Nickerson. **********''We move fast in the Eastern District of New York,'' said Mr. Maloney, who sat at the prosecution table as Mr. Frank directed the proceedings. Appearing for Hertz were a senior vice president and general counsel, Paul M. Tschirhart, and John S. Martin Jr., a former United States Attorney in Manhattan. **********In a statement issued after the session, the chairman of Hertz, Frank Olson, said the illegal practices ''were discovered by Hertz and stopped nearly two years ago.'' **********''We regret what occurred in the past,'' Mr. Olson said, ''and we have taken steps to insure not only that these practices do not happen again, but that Hertz employees conduct the company's business with the highest ethical standards.'' **********The vice president for public affairs, Joseph M. Russo, said 20 employees, including the accident-control manager, Alan Blicker, were dismissed when the company learned of the improper practices. **********Hertz is also required to publish notices about the fund and how to apply for restitutition in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. In addition, the company, is required to send separate notices, when possible, to individuals, corporations and insurers who were defrauded. **********Information about restitiution can also be obtained by writing to the Hertz Fund Administrator, P.O.

''The fellows went out of hand.'' **********His remarks were the first official admission that the state's Government has used one band of extremists against others. The official said the group of extremists was small, not more than 14 people, led by a man named Santokh Singh Kala. Security and police officials said the group's members had not been very effective in the anti-terrorist operations. **********The officials emphasized that the operation had been limited to the Amritsar region and was viewed at first as a limited part of the Government's strategy against extremism. But strong differences among police officials surfaced earlier this summer about the group's usefulness and led to its quiet withdrawal.

But officials familiar with the secret operation said the faction had a few successes, like the one last year when they ousted a group of militants based at a Sikh shrine near the Golden Temple.

The signs say ''Aliens.'' **********Perhaps, Mr. Hayashida said, it would be better to use a new term, such as ''Non-Japanese,'' or ''Other Passports,'' or something else considered less irritating to those from overseas. **********The ''Aliens'' signs are especially jarring to some foreigners making their first visit here. More than a few have been vocal on the subject as they lined up for Narita immigration inspections, with remarks commonly dwelling on extraterrestrials and Sigourney Weaver. Requests to Alter Signs **********According to immigration officials, requests to alter the signs have come from Japanese as well as foreigners, including airline representatives and travel agents. As a result, Mr. Hayashida said, he would have to give the matter serious thought. **********In Japan, solicitousness of this sort is often extended to English speakers, particularly Americans. It is quite a different story with other foreigners, notably Koreans, who form by far the largest group of non-Japanese living in this country. Korean Minister's Story **********The Rev. Choi Chang Hwa, a Korean Protestant minister in the western Japanese city of Kitakyushu, had that point reinforced even as Mr. Hayashida on Tuesday was reflecting publicly about ''Aliens.'' **********On the same day, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that it was not Mr. Choi's right to insist that television announcers pronounce his name as he wishes. It was permissible, the court said, for them to read his name according to its Japanese pronunciation, Sai Shoka. A Sore Point for Koreans **********The name issue has long been a sore point for Korean residents. **********Both they and Japanese write their names with ideographs borrowed from Chinese. Japanese tend to insist on using their own pronunciations at all times. For example, Chun Doo Hwan, the South Korean President, is routinely called Zen Tokan here. **********To many outraged Koreans, this practice is roughly equivalent to an American insisting on calling the West German Chancellor Mr. Cabbage because that's what Helmut Kohl's last name means in English. **********Mr. Choi, whose lawsuit has meandered through the courts since 1975, had protested the mangling of his name on NHK, Japan's public broadcast network. He demanded a correction, and, when the network refused, he went to court charging ''injury to his individual and ethnic pride.'' A Change in Policy **********As it happens, NHK has since changed its policy, and now gives the proper Korean reading for people living in North or South Korea. It does the same for Koreans living in Japan when they wish. But many other television and radio networks continue to follow the Zen Tokan path - even NHK announcers sometimes slip back into old habits by mistake - and the issue remains a contentious one. Difficulty in Pronunciation **********In ruling against Mr. Choi, the presiding Supreme Court justice, Atsushi Nagashima, acknowledged that a person's name ''symbolizes his individuality and constitutes a part of his human rights.'' But that did not mean that NHK had violated the minister's rights, he said, because the Japanese reading of the ideographs was accepted social custom. **********Justice Nagashima upheld a lower-court decision that had also gone against Mr. Choi. For many people, that ruling went more directly to the heart of the matter: it is difficult for Japanese to pronounce foreign names correctly, the court observed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/29/business/meatpacker-fined-a-record-amount-on-plant-injuries.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1245, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEATPACKER FINED A RECORD AMOUNT ON PLANT INJURIES", "print_headline": "MEATPACKER FINED A RECORD AMOUNT ON PLANT INJURIES", "body_text": " **********Imposing its heaviest penalty ever against a single employer, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced fines today totaling $4.3 million against John Morrell & Company for hundreds of ''egregious'' and ''willful'' violations at the meatpacker's Sioux Falls, S.D., plant. **********The Government agency said Morrell ignored workplace hazards that allowed 880 of its 2,000 employees at the plant to suffer serious, sometimes disabling muscular injuries, known as cumulative trauma disorder, between the spring of 1987 and the spring of 1988.

''And they know it,'' he added, referring to OSHA. **********The Government is not known to have questioned the quality of Morrell's products. **********The Sioux Falls plant is the biggest private employer in South Dakota and is involved in some way with about half of Morrell's $2 billion of annual sales. The company was cited in April 1987 for violations of record-keeping on injuries and illnesses of Sioux Falls workers. **********In its current action against Morrell, OSHA officials cited 722 cases of exposing workers to cumulative trauma disorders, recommending a fine of $5,000 each, or $3.6 million. An additional $710,000 was accounted for by the charge that Morrell aggravated 63 workers' injuries by providing insufficient time off or denying them restricted work. **********Paul Simon, chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Employment and Productivity and a Democrat from Illinois, said in a statement that the agency's fine ''comes too late'' to help the injured workers. He said that blame for what he called lax enforcement ''must be laid nowhere else but at the doorstep of the Reagan-Bush Administration.'' Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential candidate, is to visit Sioux Falls on Saturday and may use the occasion to take the Administration to task over alleged regulatory failures. **********Morrell said it would go to court Monday in Sioux Falls to seek an injunction in the proceedings. The company has 15 working days to contest the safety-violation charges and the proposed penalties before an independent Government agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. **********OSHA's chief, John A. Pendergrass, and other officials said at a briefing for reporters this morning that they had no evidence that Morrell had taken steps to improve plant conditions or to allow injured workers enough time off for proper recovery. Possible Solutions Offered **********They said that some of the possible solutions were a redesign of knives and work stations, slower production-line speeds, the restructuring of jobs so workers would do a variety of tasks and more rest and training. **********Mr. Schloss said, however, that the company had put in place in the last year ''a major safety improvement program'' that independent experts have held to be ''the best they have seen.'' The company produced figures showing that the number of injuries that are required to be reported to OSHA had fallen this year from a high of 75.7 per 100 full-time employees at the plant in February to 18.7 or less for August, September and October. It was 59.5 for April, the last month included in the agency citation. Morrell Cites Labor Dispute **********Morrell, which attributes much of its OSHA problems to a labor dispute over pay and the fact that it had to hire many inexperienced replacement workers because of a bitter strike last year, said the ''simplest and most reliable'' method of reducing repetitive-motion disorders was to vary workers' daily routines so different muscles were used. ''Unfortunately,'' it added in its statement, ''union work rules and the grievance process have often been used to block'' rotation efforts. **********The United Food and Commercial Workers responded to the OSHA citations with a statement by its president declaring that the action ''finally exposes the ugly truth about health and safety conditions'' in the Sioux Falls plant. The union's effort, said William H. Wynn, the union's president, ''has paid off.'' **********Mr. Wynn said Morrell was the first company ever to be cited for willfully causing workers to suffer repeat injuries because of lack of time off to recover from earlier ones and called the company's medical system ''medieval.'' **********In its citation, the agency said that 63 employees had surgery for cumulative trauma injury disorders over a 12-month period. Dozens of workers had no time off for surgery for which the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended 30 to 60 days off, depending on the type of surgery involved. **********Morrell said these disorders occur in ''a multitude'' of industries and affect typists, cashiers, data-entry processors, musicians and newspaper reporters. **********Mr. Schloss, Morrell's chairman, said that O.S.H.A. should be stopped from ''singling us out for penalties and imposition of arbitrary standards for what is clearly a national, multi-industry safety and health problem.'' Another Meatpacker Fined **********Earlier this year, OSHA imposed a $3.1 million fine against IBP Inc. for requiring repetitive motions that caused injuries at that company's meatpacking plant in Dakota City, Neb. If the levy against Morrell stands, it would slightly exceed a $4.2 million agency fine imposed in November 1987 against the Bath Iron Works in Maine, which was cited for endangering shipyard workers by exposing them to asbestos and raw sewage. **********Last week the April 1987 case against Morrell was dismissed by James A. Cronin Jr., an administrative law judge, who found that the agency had not filed its complaint within the specified six months allowed, but that, in any event, the maximum penalty that could have been considered was $11,000 since it was improper, in effect, to make each alleged infraction a separate violation. **********Today, however, OSHA officials insisted they were correct to take the same approach again in citing the individual cases. **********The agency said its investigation began nearly six months ago in response to a complaint from a worker. It added, however, that management knew about the causes and remedies for the trauma injuries ''perhaps as early as 1984'' but failed to remedy them. **********''This case involves an employer who knew about a serious health hazard, saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it,'' Mr. Pendergrass of OSHA said. ''Meatpackers in general and Morrell in particular must do a far better job of protecting their workers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/12/business/dow-loses-249-points-trading-is-listless.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1988-10-12", "snippet": "LEAD: Stock prices pulled back in listless trading yesterday.

''I think that describes pretty well the recentering of political life in France.'' **********The pace of events this month has been so swift - a presidential election, then a decision to hold legislative elections in June - that there has been little time to mark the anniversary of the May 1968 revolt of students and workers, which shook France's cultural foundations and ultimately drove Charles de Gaulle from the presidency. **********Yet if there is a living monument to the spirit of 1968 it is Libe, as the tabloid is familiarly known. It is a measure of the newspaper's evolution toward mainstream respectability that Mr. July's trenchant election commentaries are among the most widely read in the country, on both sides of the political divide. Cigar and Keyboard **********From his glassed-in cubicle at Liberation's unorthodox offices in a converted parking garage on Rue Beranger, near Place de la Republique, the 45-year-old Mr. July is an institution within an institution. He has just a hint of a midlife paunch, and he directs the flow of information and reporters with a fat cigar; when he writes, he throws his legs up on his desk and, peering through tinted glasses, taps at a computer-terminal keyboard pulled onto his lap. **********''His real talent is to animate the newspaper,'' said Serge Daney, a film and television critic who sits a few paces from the editor. ''He is in the very French tradition of the boss who is everywhere, who gets mixed up in everything, who embodies his company to the outside world. **********''But Serge is not a bureaucrat, and he is not an adventurer,'' Mr. Daney added, sketching the Scylla and Charybdis through which Liberation must navigate daily. ''He is a politician with a concrete sense of reality. He is not an ideologue. He loves contradictions for their own sake.'' **********Liberation emerged from an alternative news service created in the upheaval of 1968, and Jean-Paul Sartre served as its emblematic director. In keeping with its grass-roots traditions, Liberation survived by appealing to its readers for donations. **********Since coming to the helm of the flagship of the French counterculture in 1974, Mr. July has escaped several shipwrecks and now seems to have Libe on a steady course. The newspaper has lost some of the chaotic spontaneity of its infancy, but without abandoning its sassiness and love of wild puns. It has also gone a bit bourgeois, publishing stock tables and paying editors more than reporters. **********Libe's stockholders include unabashed capitalists who have bought into a newspaper that trails such competitors as Le Monde and Le Figaro in circulation but seems to have a promising future. So far, though, a handful of ventures - a stillborn radio station, a TV production company and a special edition in Lyons - have been money losers; a photo agency, Vu, runs in the black. **********A gripping election season has been a boon for Liberation's circulation, which leaped from a normal press run of 350,000 to a record 900,000 on May 9, the day after President Francois Mitterrand was re-elected. The front page that day carried a photograph of the Socialist President with his 54 percent tally and the appreciative exclamation: ''L'artiste!'' **********Throughout, Mr. July has weighed in with commentaries on the subtle realignments of the artful Mr. Mitterrand. While Libe's editor clearly savors the discomfort of the right, his tone has been cool and analytical - quite a change for the Mao enthusiast of old who once penned an incendiary tract titled ''Toward Civil War.'' **********From behind his desk, Mr. July teased out the irony that, two decades after May 1968, France had again sprouted a movement of social protest, this time from the extreme right. He likened the oratorical gifts of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the xenophobic, anti-immigrant National Front, to those of America's television evangelists, and he argued that Le Penism has emerged from the shambles of three exhausted movements: the Communist Party, Gaullism and the Roman Catholic Church. **********''Le Pen incarnates just the opposite values of Cohn-Bendit,'' said the editor, referring to Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the champion of the 1968 student revolt. ''Cohn-Bendit said, 'We are all German Jews.' Le Pen says, 'France to the French.' '' **********The most conspicuous divide in France, Mr. July said, is not between right and left but between the majority of society, which has adjusted to the rapid process of modernization, and an important minority ''that is living this as an anguish, an absolute decline.'' Mr. Le Pen recruits on this terrain of fear and despair. 'Principal Conservative' **********Mr. July said that Mr. Mitterrand, despite being a Socialist, was ''the principal conservative candidate'' in the election. Mr. July said that Mr. Mitterrand, ''through his intuition and intelligence, knew how to seize a demand for protection'' arising from fears that the welfare state was menaced by the free-market doctrines of Jacques Chirac, the President's neo-Gaullist opponent. **********Mr. Mitterrand seems almost certain to lead his Socialist Party to a victory in the National Assembly elections next month. With a majority-vote system in effect, the Communist Party and the National Front could place only a handful of deputies in the 577-member lower house. **********But Mr. July said defeat might not eliminate the National Front as long as France is dogged by high unemployment and a pervasive feeling that the country is in decline. **********''Everything depends on the capacity of the right to find a leader that can resolve its problems.'' said Mr. July, who noted that Mr. Chirac, along with Raymond Barre, a former Prime Minister, and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, has a claim to leading the political right. **********The newspaper business, he said, has better prospects, and a television-dominated campaign evidently generated a thirst for the kind of commentary that Liberation supplied. ''A great newspaper can only be on the center-left,'' said the ex-revolutionary, summing up the many miles he has traveled in two decades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/21/business/credit-markets-bid-for-rjr-nabisco-jolts-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1988-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1038, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bid for RJR Nabisco Jolts Bonds", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Bid for RJR Nabisco Jolts Bonds", "body_text": " **********The corporate bond market was jolted yesterday by the $17 billion leveraged buyout offer for RJR Nabisco. **********Prices of the company's outstanding intermediate and long-term debt plummeted and yields rose by nearly two full percentage points after the announcement yesterday morning. While traders said the rest of the secondary corporate market held up well, the steep decline in RJR issues did generate small price declines in other issues as well. **********By late yesterday, for example, R.J. Reynolds 8 5/8 percent bonds that mature in 2017 were offered at 72 1/2, traders said, down 14 1/2 points on the day, or $145 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield around 12 percent. The buyout offer to take the consumer products company private was made by senior RJR Nabisco executives and Shearson Lehman Hutton, a unit of the American Express Company. Takeover-Related Decline **********The movement in RJR bonds was merely the latest takeover-related drop that has occurred this week. Earlier, prices of outstanding Philip Morris securities fell sharply after the company made an unsolicited offer for the Kraft Company. **********''Over the last 30 days or so it has become increasingly obvious that there is an increasing level of event risk in the bond market because stock market prices are so low,'' said James Ednie, corporate vice president and senior industrial corporate bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''Bondholders suffer from those sorts of transactions, because securities become increasingly attractive to raiders and management. It is clear that the industrial bond market cannot benefit from this deal.'' **********Underscoring Mr. Ednie's point were the actions taken by the two major ratings services, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, in the wake of the RJR announcement. Agencies Monitor Ratings **********Yesterday afternoon both agencies said they were monitoring the company and suggested that ratings might be downgraded on RJR's $5 billion in outstanding debt. The company currently is rated A by both services. **********The ripples that spread from the RJR announcement were big enough to overcome a rise in the secondary Treasury bond market and caused prices of many other industrial bond issues to ease by about one-quarter of a point, traders said. **********Generally, corporate prices move in line with the Treasury market. **********A drop in oil prices and what appear to be fast-fading prospects for passage of a technical corrections bill that would allow the Treasury to issue new 30-year bonds next month helped bolster prices of notes and bonds yesterday. Trading activity, however, remained quite light. **********''We should know by late Friday whether or not Congress will pass the bond authority,'' said David Green, head of the government bond trading department at Chemical Bank. ''Right now, the market is pricing the thirty-year as though there is less than a 50 percent chance that we will be bidding on new bonds in November.'' **********In late trading yesterday, the 9 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2018 were offered at a price of 103, up 19/ 32 on the day, to yield 8.83 percent. **********But such gains, built on the idea that no new bonds will be offered, could dissipate quickly, some analysts said. **********''If the technical corrections bill doesn't get passed, I think that long bond prices will fall some,'' said Joel Marver, chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data International, a financial consulting firm in Boston. ''This is a classic, 'buy the rumor, sell the news' sort of development. Watching the to's and fro's on this issue has so captivated the market that it will be a relief to have it out of the way.'' **********Yields on the Treasury's 9 1/4 percent 10-year notes also fell in anticipation that no new bonds will be offered this year. **********By late in the day, the issue was offered at 103 1/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.78 percent. **********Short-term bill rates were little changed. **********For example, the two-year notes to be sold next Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis yesterday at a price to yield 8.35 percent, down 1 basis point, or hundredth of a point, from late Wednesday. **********One-year Treasury bills auctioned yesterday were sold at an average discount rate of 7.57 percent, up sharply from the 7.48 percent average rate at the last auction on Sept. 22. **********In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board said yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Oct. 10. **********Although the monetary aggregates have been under closer scrutiny in recent weeks, yesterday's announcement had no impact on bond prices. **********The Fed also said that borrowings at its discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $600 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from an average of $446 million in the previous week. **********The Fed said that the two-week borrowing average was $523 million a day, down from $734 million a day in the previous two-week period, and the lowest for any period since the two weeks ended June 29, when borrowing averaged $520 million a day. **********Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday, with little movement in prices. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)  Average Price . . . 92.346  Discounted Rate . . . 7.57%  Coupon Yield . . . 8.15%  High Price . . . 92.346  Discounted Rate . . . 7.57%  Coupon Yield . . . 8.15%  Low Price . . . 92.376  Discounted Rate . . . 7.54%  Coupon Yield . . . 8.11%  Accepted at low price . . . 81%  Total applied for . . . $27,507,185  Accepted . . . $9,017,615  N.Y. applied for . . . $24,154,200  N.Y. accepted . . . $7,747,650  Noncompetitive . . . $423,490  The one-year bills mature Oct. 26, 1989."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-buildings-to-lois-pitts.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1988-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buildings to Lois Pitts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Buildings to Lois Pitts", "body_text": " **********Lois Pitts Gershon Pon/GGK has been named to handle advertising for three new buildings owned by Solomon Equities, a Manhattan real estate developer.

A Legion of 500,000 **********They are part of a legion, now estimated at 500,000 people, who are penetrating Brazil's wild interior and tapping the Amazon's rich deposits of alluvial gold. **********With their primitive tools, they have made Brazil the world's fifth-largest gold producer. Government officials said that last year industrial mining companies produced 13 tons of gold, but that freelance gold diggers lifted an estimated 70 tons of gold from the wilderness, worth almost $1 billion. **********Brazil's modern gold rush is nearly a decade old but it is accelerating as a severe economic recession leaves more and more people without regular jobs. The gold fever has reached such a vast scale that mineral experts are now describing it as the greatest mining rush on record. 'No One Knows the Number' **********In the past year, new wildcat diggings have opened. They are scattered over thousands of miles, reaching north to the rugged borders with Venezuela and Guyana and west to Colombia and Bolivia. **********Like pioneers, the gold diggers have cut new trails, opened trade routes and extended the settled parts of Brazil. They move across the north and center of Brazil, exploring or following rumors of new discoveries. **********''No one knows the number of camps and sites,'' said Jose Altino Machado, who heads the Federation of Independent Prospectors. ''You can't keep up. They open and close and reopen again.'' Some camps have a few hundred people, others thousands, he said. Serra Pelada, the biggest mine ever, drew as many as 60,000 prospectors. **********The fever's effects extend far beyond the men who strike fortunes. It has spawned networks of smugglers who take much of the bullion out of the country and trade it for dollars, weapons or drugs. Pilots, prostitutes and suppliers of equipment, food and alcohol have followed the camps. **********''If you count the dependants and the spinoffs, the whole economy of support and logistics, some five million people are now living off the gold rush,'' Mr. Machado said. **********The highest yield at the moment comes from Alta Floresta, a rough and muddy county seat set in a formidable rain forest. A tiny outpost on the cattle frontier in 1980, today it has 121,000 inhabitants and a floating population of about 80,000 diggers in the bush. There are eight banks, 36 establishments that buy and sell gold, 20 drug stores, 68 guest houses and hotels and a circuit of cabarets. **********Three inspectors at the tax office are responsible for monitoring the flow. ''We just cannot cope,'' said Jose Ojeda, the office director. In March they had registered 271 kilos, or about 600 pounds, in the Alta Floresta region, worth almost $4 million. ''We know the figure is much, much higher,'' said Mr. Ojeda. ''Most of the gold goes into the illegal trade.'' **********Alta Floresta's real heart is the airfield, a paved though unlit runway at the end of a sandy road. One recent morning it had the makings of a mobile market, with loaders putting bags of rice and beans into tiny planes, and a motley group of gold diggers waiting for a ride. The day before, a control post operator said, there were ''187 takeoffs and landings, worthy of the great capitals.'' **********Flights were going out to jungle camps, places not yet mapped, with names like Planet, Wild Turkey, Shootout. Passengers had no need to register. This was a world that used nicknames only, no questions asked. Paying the Fare in Gold **********''To Alto Alegre?'' a traveler with two heavy gold chains asked a pilot known as ''Spirit.'' In gold dust, came the reply, that would be 33 grams. **********Bush pilots like Spirit, who airlift people and goods, are an indispensable part of the modern gold rush. Often owners of their airplanes, they ride their craft like cowboys, wheeling them up and down bumpy strips just 200 or 300 yards long. But near Itaituba, another major gold digging area, two planes crashed recently, killing seven people. ''In the jungle you can find an airstrip by looking for wrecks,'' Spirit said. **********The harsh life at the remote jungle camps seems an antithesis of what gold can buy. The center of the camp is usually the bar-brothel. **********In the sprawling heat of the day, crews work from rafts on the river to pump gravel from the riverbed. Others blast open the earth in the diggings with high pressure water hoses. At makeshift ''refineries'' gravel and tailings pass through portable mills. Then the mud is washed and sluiced in boxes where the gold is leached out with mercury; people downstream have been poisoned by the mercury. **********Although many prospectors pan and sift on their own, others are contract workers. A young peasant here said he earns the equivalent of $250 per month, about four times the wage he could make on a farm. He also receives a small percentage of his bosses' findings. Some of that was now on display in fillings in his front teeth. ''I hope to get enough to buy land,'' he said. 'Gold Makes Trouble' **********But fortunes are usually made by less humble people, men who get control over an air strip or have enough capital to take equipment to the jungle and appropriate a site. Yet in this wilderness, rich and poor alike are pockmarked with insect bites and skin afflictions. Many have hepatitis or malaria. **********As the gold fever has grown, so have the conflicts. Reports of murder in the mining areas are frequent. Men have killed one another over a fixing of gold scales, over claim jumping and dividing profits. **********''Gold makes trouble, it creates ambition and jealousy,'' said Adalberto Oliveira, the Alta Floresta police chief. Half a dozen men were visible behind the bars of a communal jail cell. ''Now it's the rainy season, so the murder rate is down,'' the police chief added. **********Across the country, there are frequent reports of clashes between the armed guards of mining companies and prospectors who accuse each other of invading the other's claim. The companies as well as the prospectors in turn have invaded Indian lands. ''It's straight out of Brazil's 18th-century history,'' said Peter Rich, a mining consultant. ''It has the same elements: Indians, gold diggers, soldiers and missionaries.'' Prospector as Folk Hero **********In this nation where the frontier spirit is still strong and the rugged prospectors are widely seen as folk heroes, the Government has rarely intervened. But last month, in an unusual move, the Brazilian National Security Council decided that troops should be sent to clear prospectors from newly invaded Indian lands. **********As many as 15,000 gold diggers reportedly have recently encroached on the reservation of the Yanomami Indians near the northern town of Boa Vista. Tribesmen have been patrolling the makeshift air strip and are reportedly charging the small planes considerable sums for landing rights. A few weeks ago, when pilots refused to pay, tribesmen rolled out trees and blocked a landing strip. **********Several large corporations and financiers have obtained new mining licenses and joined the rush. But other companies say they fear the present climate of anarchy. **********''Our mining laws are being raped, they have become worthless,'' said Octavio Lacombe, the president of Parapanema, Brazil's largest private mining conglomerate. His company began work on a rich site south of Alta Floresta in 1986. But within a year it pulled out and sold off most of its equipment to local gold diggers. **********''It was madness, they were shooting at our people,'' said Mr. Lacombe in his office in Sao Paulo. ''The Government is crazy to let the gold diggers carry on. They make off with the gold, they pay no taxes.'' 'Only Viable Occupation' **********Along the wild Juruena River, an Amazon tributary to the west of here, prospectors and a mining company are now battling over a site that the company maintains holds as much as 40 tons of gold. Although the company obtained a legal mining license here, prospectors say they discovered the gold and were unjustly chased away. Last month, after a judge divided the Juruena land, 3,000 prospectors moved back in. Three men have been killed on each side of the conflict. **********With millions of dollars worth of gold at stake, confrontations are likely to continue. At issue, industrial miners say, is the future use of the Amazon. ''The only viable occupation in the Amazon is mining,'' said Antonio Dias Leite, the head of the Association of Gold Mine Industries. ''The soil is too poor for agriculture and it's a crime to destroy the forest for cattle projects. We have to mine the wealth but we need a policy, not anarchy, not this predatory prospecting.'' **********''This is an unfair battle,'' said Irene Briccatti, the lawyer for the Juruena gold diggers. ''The gold diggers get into the jungles and struggle and find the gold. Then the companies hear about it. They have power and money and they pay bribes to get licenses.'' **********The mining companies hope that law and order will be re-established this year when Brazil's new constitution is completed. But in several states, political leaders have made it clear they do not want to risk violence by confronting the gold diggers. **********Alta Floresta, for one, is on the side of the gold diggers. Town officials have lobbied for them in the Juruena conflict. When there is no money to send Mrs. Briccatti, the gold diggers' lawyer, to Brasilia, the far-off capital, local people hold street collections to raise the travel funds. Mrs. Briccatti said she has been to Brasilia 21 times."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/01/world/for-gorbachev-met-museum-and-trump-tower-visits-due.html": {"writer_name": "James Barron", "pub_date": "1988-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Gorbachev, Met Museum And Trump Tower Visits Due", "print_headline": "For Gorbachev, Met Museum And Trump Tower Visits Due", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

Pelletreau Jr., said after the 1-hour, 40-minute meeting. Mr. Pelletreau is the United States Ambassador to Tunis, where the P.L.O. has its headquarters.  Details Not Provided **********Mr. Pelletreau said the discussions were ''practical and characterized by seriousness of purpose.'' The head of the P.L.O. delegation, Yasir Abed Rabbo, said the session was ''constructive and fair.'' **********[ The talks began as four Palestinians were killed in clashes with security forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It was the highest one-day death toll in the Palestinian uprising since April. At the same time, Syria rejected the P.L.O.'s discussions with the United States, with official newspapers declaring that peace in the Middle East ''should be taken by force.''

But at a news briefing earlier today in Tunis, 10 miles south of here, Mr. Pelletreau said he would ''make it clear how we feel about terrorism.''  Arafat Reported in Rumania **********The meeting followed an American announcement Wednesday that Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, had fulfilled Washington's conditions for talks: recognition of Israel, renunciation of terrorism and acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for peace in the Middle East. **********In making the announcement, Secretary of State George P. Shultz designated Mr. Pelletreau as the sole authorized liaison. Joining Mr. Pelletreau at the talks here today was Edmund J. Hull, political counselor at the embassy in Tunis. The P.L.O. team was made up of Mr. Abed, executive committee member; Hakem Belawi, P.L.O. representative in Tunisia; Abdellatif Abu Hajla, director general of the political department, and Abdullah Hourani, executive committee member. **********Mr. Arafat was in Bucharest, Rumania, today, where he met with President Nicolae Ceausescu. A P.L.O. official said Thursday that Mr. Arafat might join the talks later. It is not clear whether the talks will resume before the Bush Administration takes office next month. Strong Attack on Israel **********While Mr. Pelletreau's statement was brief and general, Mr. Abed issued a strong attack on Israel and a defense of the yearlong Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Mr. Abed said he hoped the discussions would ''enable us to get closer to an international conference of peace in the Middle East.'' He said the American decision to begin talks with the P.L.O. put pressure on Israel to change its policies. **********''Only the rulers of Israel are insisting on a policy of arrogance, terrorism, continuing oppression and rejection of all United Nations resolutions,'' he said. **********''We're here to achieve the goals and aims of the uprising,'' he said. ''It will end with the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.'' **********At his briefing earlier at the embassy in Tunis, Mr. Pelletreau offered a more detailed account of American intentions and strategy. He had invited only American journalists for background information, to be attributed to a Western diplomat. Favors Direct Negotiations **********But some British reporters, briefed afterward by their American colleagues, filed articles quoting the Ambassador by name. **********Repeating several points made this week by Mr. Shultz and other American officials, Mr. Pelletreau said that ''part of our general principle is that direct negotiations are the best way'' to achieve peace between Israel and its Arab foes. He said he did not expect much from the opening round of talks, declaring that the fact that the meeting was taking place at all is ''perhaps a happening itself, the most important aspect.'' **********''A dialogue can only happen in a new administration,'' he said. ''On things of substance, we'll have a wait-and-see attitude.'' **********Mr. Pelletreau said the United States expected Mr. Arafat to condemn and disassociate himself from any acts of terrorism by Palestinian factions. Concern Is Expressed **********''What we want to do is to make sure P.L.O. performance matches Arafat's promise,'' he said. **********Asked about terrorism by factions other than Mr. Arafat's group, Al Fatah, Mr. Pelletreau said, ''We are capable of taking a realistic view of what happens, but expect the P.L.O. to disassociate itself very quickly.'' **********Mr. Pelletreau and other American officials expressed concern that too much might be expected from the talks. They said the process would be long, complicated and frustrating. **********The meeting was held on an unusually cold day for North Africa, with the temperature in the upper 40's. The participants gathered at 4:20 P.M. to pose for pictures and began their discussions about 15 minutes later. **********The delegations faced each other across two tables covered with green tablecloths and two pots of flowers.

Allen, addressing shareholders after being named chairman of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company last week. Mr. Allen, 53 years old, got the job after the sudden death of James E. Olson, who succumbed to cancer at the age of 62. **********And it was a moment of uncertainty for the corporation. Mr. Allen's background is as solid as that of any previous chairman. But where Mr. Olson was an outgoing and dynamic man, Mr. Allen is a laid-back manager who characterizes himself as a team player and admits to difficulty in public speaking. **********Some analysts wonder whether Mr. Allen will be forceful enough to command A.T.&T., which is still struggling to transform itself into a competitive computer and communications company. **********''Olson rallied the troops and convinced them to march to the same drum,'' said Robert B. Morris 3d, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc. ''Getting people to believe in your strategy is crucial to implementing it.'' **********As he presided over the company's 103d annual meeting here last week, Mr. Allen seemed, at first, to be confirming the fears about him. Shaken by his colleague's death, he looked fatigued and uncomfortable as he addressed an audience of about 2,000 shareholders and employees. He was the reserved, analytical executive - giving concise replies during the question-and-answer period. **********Then, about halfway through the meeting, another Mr. Allen emerged. He began joking with board members and shareholders. And he delivered a heated denunciation of a proposal by a white supremacist group to phase out A.T.&T.'s affirmative action program. At the end of the meeting, the shareholders gave him an ovation. **********It was the first public test of Mr. Allen's ability to command the giant telecommunications company, and he passed. But a one-time performance does not shed much light on Mr. Allen's management style. **********Many of Mr. Allen's close former associates say it is unfair to speculate on how he will conduct himself as chief executive so soon after his appointment. And, indeed, his style may still be evolving. Mr. Allen himself told reporters that he admired the way Mr. Olson managed, but that there was ''no style that could be characterized as mine.'' **********Some colleagues say that he has a ''controlled charisma'' that he can turn on and off when needed - as he did at the annual meeting. And people who have worked under Mr. Allen say that he delegates major tasks and allows members of his staff to work at their own pace as long as they produce results. **********''He does not hover over you every step of the way,'' said Hal Burlington, A.T.&T. senior vice president of human resources. ''You feel a sense of shared responsibility and that in itself is inspiring.'' Mr. Allen is also a pensive man who spends part of each day alone in his office. ''He may not be a dynamic speaker, but he's a powerful listener,'' said one A.T.&T. executive, who, like many at the company, including Mr. Allen himself, declined to speak publicly about the transition. ''He has the ability to read through any clutter and focus directly on the problem.'' **********Associates also say that Mr. Allen can be tough when he has to be. In 1985, he eliminated 24,000 jobs from the company's flagging Information Systems Division, which was responsible for computers. It was the largest staff reduction of a single division in A.T.&T. history. **********According to Mary Anne Devanna, management professor at Columbia Business School, a corporate leader does not have to be charismatic to be effective. ''We hear stories about Lee Iacocca and Jack Welch all the time,'' she said, referring to the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation and to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric. ''But there are plenty of others who are effective leaders, such as Larry Tisch, who are not very dynamic.'' (Laurence A. Tisch is chairman of the Loews Corporation.) **********WHATEVER questions the board may have had about Mr. Allen's charisma, his credentials are unassailable. He has spent his entire career at the Bell System, climbing the same corporate ladder as the 12 chairmen before him. **********He started at Indiana Bell in 1957, after graduating from Wabash College, an all-male school in Crawsfordsville, Ind. In 1972, the same year Mr. Olson became president of Indiana Bell, Mr. Allen became the regional's vice president in charge of rates and revenues. **********After serving as vice president of Bell of Pennsylvania from 1974-76, Mr. Allen became chief operating officer at Illinois Bell in 1976, where Mr. Olson was president. Illinois Bell was the launching pad for several A.T.&T. chairmen, including Mr. Olson, Charles L. Brown and John D. deButts. **********In 1981, Mr. Allen was president of the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company; by 1983, he was executive vice president and chief financial officer at A.T.&T. **********He moved to the Information Systems Division in 1985, as its chairman and chief executive, became president and chief operating officer of A.T.&T. in September 1986. He was elected chairman and chief executive last Tuesday night at a special meeting of the board of directors. **********Mr. Allen has said he will continue Mr. Olson's strategy of strengthening A.T.&.T.'s long-distance service and equipment businesses while expanding overseas and in the computer and data system markets. But he faces some significant obstacles. When it announced its quarterly earnings at the annual meeting, A.T.&T. showed continuing problems with computers and office equipment. Its strength was in services, mainly long distance, which reported an 8.2 percent increase in revenues. **********One item high on Mr. Allen's agenda will be a proposal by the Federal Communications Commission that would allow the company to increase profits from long distance calls. Currently, the F.C.C. restricts A.T.&T.'s profits from its long distance business. But the agency has proposed a new form of regulation that would impose ceilings on long distance rates but no limit on profits. **********The plan faces opposition from Congress, consumer groups and A.T.&T.'s rivals, who say that it would end the downward trend in long distance rates and limit competition. **********''Price caps should be at the top of Mr. Allen's list - they are vital to A.T.&T.'s future,'' said William S. McKeever, an analyst with First Boston. ''Removing the restriction on A.T.&T.'s profit from long distance will give the company more incentives to be more competitive.'' **********Mr. Allen will also be under pressure to control costs - a task that analysts say is particularly difficult for a company as big as A.T.&T., which is accustomed to throwing lots of manpower and money at problems. The paring had already begun under Mr. Olson, who, during his 20 months as chairman, sharply reduced A.T.&T.'s costs through layoffs and writeoffs. **********Mr. Allen faces a challenge of a different sort in building A.T.&T.'s computer business. The company has already decided that it will develop computers that can function as part of sophisticated data networks. But products with broad market appeal have yet to appear. **********A.T.&T. must also strengthen its push into foreign markets. The domestic market for telecommunications is so crowded with competitors that there is little room for A.T.&.T. to grow. To break down the barriers abroad - where many nations restrict foreign competition in telecommunications - Mr. Allen must develop political skills along with his business strategy. **********As a relatively young chairman, Mr. Allen may be at the helm of A.T.&T. for some time. His promotion may also change the shape of the top management tier altogether. **********Mr. Olson had created an Office of the Chairman, which includes Mr. Allen and three vice chairman: Charles Marshall, 58; Morris Tanenbaum, 59; and Randall L. Tobias, 46. **********Some analysts say that Mr. Tobias, who oversees long distance and computer marketing, would be next in line to replace Mr. Allen as president and chief operating officer. **********OTHERS, however, say that Mr. Allen may eliminate the position of president. At the recent press conference, Mr. Allen said that he is considering some organizational changes. One reason might be that there is no one who could fill the job of president right now. **********At least one of Mr. Allen's former colleagues says that if the post does survive, Mr. Tobias may be considered too inexperienced for it. In that case, says this former colleague, Mr. Allen may be tempted to look for someone outside of the Office of the Chairman - someone with Mr. Olson's dynamic style. **********Professor Devanna agrees. ''What may happen is that Mr. Allen will choose a president who has many of Mr. Olson's qualities - in effect, reestablishing the management team.''  AT A GLANCE: A.T.&T.

It was the first time that the Government had made public this indicator of its economic distress. **********Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev, in disclosing the anticipated 36.3 billion ruble deficit to a session of the Soviet parliament, or Supreme Soviet, said big Government subsidies of mismanaged industry and agriculture were among the main culprits. **********He said in an interview that similar deficits had been run in previous years, but never disclosed publicly. Usually the Government reports a slight surplus in its budget when it announces the financial plan for the following year. Barometer of Economic Ills **********The Finance Minister said he did not consider the deficit alarming by Western standards, but he said it was a barometer of economic ill health and could contribute to inflation. **********Inflation is another economic phenomenon the Soviet Union has just recently acknowledged, although there is no reliable estimate of how high inflation has been because the Soviet Union does not have a retail price index to measure changes in what consumers really pay for their goods. **********The new 494 billion ruble, or $790 billion, budget also bulges with evidence of the priorities of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, including sharp increases in spending to modernize the consumer products industry, housing and health, education and environmental protection. Lure Western Investment **********As part of the effort to revitalize the economy, Konstantin F. Katushev, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, said in an interview that the Government, eager to lure more Western investment, has agreed for the first time to let foreign companies own controlling interest in Soviet joint ventures. **********The officially admitted Soviet budget deficit is about 4 percent of the country's domestic production - including the total the Government estimates is involved in the shadow economy, which is not officially recorded or included in the official budget. **********By comparison, the United States deficit in the $1.06 trillion budget for the fiscal year just ended was about $150 billion, somewhat more than 3 percent of the gross national product, which was about $4.8 trillion in the last fiscal year. **********This afternoon the Finance Minister, Mr. Gostev, said his main strategy for restoring a budget balance would be to cut subsidies to failing state industries, including forcing some into bankruptcy if necessary. 'We Shall Have a Stock Market' **********Another measure to alleviate the deficit, he said in the interview, would be to raise new money for industry and agriculture by selling shares of enterprises to workers and outsiders. The newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported last week that the Government has approved such a plan. **********''This means we shall have a stock market,'' Mr. Gostev told a small group of reporters in St. George's Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace. **********The Finance Minister said the Government had also begun a wide-ranging study of Western tax systems with the idea of introducing an entire new tax system here in the 1990's. **********Mr. Katushev, the foreign trade official, said new laws to be introduced early next year would eliminate the current limit of 49 percent foreign ownership, and ease other restrictions on Western business operations here. **********Mr. Katushev predicted that the new laws on joint ownership would not set any specific limit on foreign ownership, but he indicated that some Soviet share would be required. The Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, has reportedly told visiting European economic officials that foreigners would be allowed to own up to 80 percent of a joint venture. **********The decision, ceding a large measure of management control and ownership to capitalists, is another indication of how far the Soviets are willing to bend Communist ideology to salvage their economy. **********Mark Vecchio, an American lawyer specializing in Soviet-American ventures, said today that the offer of controlling interest would be an enticement to some companies that have held back from the Soviet market for fear of losing control over quality, patents or technology. 'An Unbalanced Economy' **********But he noted that this would not remove the main obstacle that has dampened the interest of Western investors - the Soviet insistence that foreign partners take most of their profits home in Soviet rubles or commodities. **********Soviet officials began acknowledging the existence of a budget deficit earlier this year after many years of fiscal legerdemain produced paper surpluses. **********Mr. Gostev declined to estimate for reporters the deficits in the current or past years, but he said the sum has been ''stable.'' **********''This is not a problem that has cropped up all of a sudden,'' Mr. Gostev told the Supreme Soviet. ''It is a result of an unbalanced economy, of excessive subsidies, of huge losses caused by extensive management methods, parasitic attitudes and passive financial policy.'' **********Mr. Gostev's budget report today was more detailed than those previously made public, but it did not provide the full accounting of military spending Soviet officials have promised. Following traditional practice, the Finance Minister identified only the 20.2 billion rubles, or $32.3 billion, budgeted for maintaining armed forces personnel, but made no mention of weaponry, bases or other military expenses. **********Some Western analysts say they believe large parts of the military budget are buried in vague budget categories covering capital investments and in the budgets for such state-owned industries as aviation, electronics and machine tools. **********Mr. Gostev said one major factor in the deficit was the falling price of the oil Moscow sells on the world market, which he said had cost the state $64 billion since 1985. The Government was also battered by the cost of cleaning up the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and the loss of income from alcohol sales due to the Government campaign against alcoholism."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/17/business/rates-mark-time-in-quiet-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rates Mark Time in Quiet Trading", "print_headline": "Rates Mark Time in Quiet Trading", "body_text": " **********Interest rates were little changed in very quiet trading yesterday. **********Although 30-year Treasury bond yields of about 9 percent are almost a half percentage point lower than they were a month ago, securities dealers said the arguments in favor of lower rates were still too tenuous to entice more investors and bring yields down further. **********Yields of long-term Treasury issues have been fluctuating around 9 percent for about two weeks, ''but we need some more unequivocal signs of economic weakness to extend the rally,'' said the director of institutional sales at one firm. **********Declines in energy and gold prices yesterday were of little benefit to the credit markets, even though those two commodities are widely followed as leading indicators of inflation.

The two-year note yield is about a fourth of a percentage point higher than the recent average for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market.

The four-part financing was backed by a pool of Veterans Administration-insured whole loans with yields ranging from 9.61 percent for an issue with an estimated average life of 3.4 years to 10.39 percent for an issue with an average life of 19.9 years. Spreads over Treasury issues with similar maturities ranged from 1.1 percentage points for the 3.4- year issue to 1 3/8 percentage points for the 19.9-year issue. **********In other activity, the Ford Motor Credit Company issued $50 million of floating-rate notes due in 2048. The 60-year issue might prove to be much shorter, since investors have the option to sell the notes back to the Ford unit after 10 years and every three years thereafter.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, had no authority to sign it in the first place. **********By a vote of 91 to 6, the Senate rejected Mr. Helms's contention that the treaty eliminating Soviet and American land-based medium- and shorter-range missiles was invalid because Mr. Gorbachev, who is General Secretary of the Communist Party, is not the Soviet chief of state and therefore had no authority under Soviet law to have entered into a binding treaty. **********Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev signed the arms accord - known officially as the Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or I.N.F. - last Dec. 8 at their Washington summit conference. They hope to exchange formal ratification documents at their meeting in Moscow, starting May 29. **********''He is the boss of the Communist Party, nothing more, nothing less,'' Mr. Helms said of the Soviet leader. ''Accepting his signature would be comparable to allowing the chairman of the Republican National Committee to sign a treaty on behalf of the United States and thereby have him pretend to bind the country and future administrations.'' **********Mr. Helms complained that the State Department had neglected to obtain specific authorization from such officials as the President of the Supreme Soviet or the Soviet Foreign Minister to enable Mr. Gorbachev to act on behalf of the Soviet Union. He noted that such authorization had been obtained in 1972, when Leonid I. Brezhnev, then the Communist Party leader, signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. **********Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, cited the Vienna Convention of 1969 to show that the specific authorizations sought by Mr. Helms were not necessary. His Authority Not in Doubt **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, another committee member, suggested that even aside from the Vienna Convention, the United States had no doubt that Mr. Gorbachev determines foreign policy for the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Helms, a North Carolina Republican, opposes the treaty and has prepared a series of procedural and policy challenges in hopes of blocking its approval by the required two-thirds of the Senate. If and when the Senate disposes of those challenges, it will face a more serious, and largely partisan, battle within the ranks of treaty supporters over a proposed condition on treaty interpretation. The condition seeks to affirm the Senate's constitutional role in approving treaties and to establish that the executive branch cannot reinterpret treaties without Senate consent. **********It has its roots in a dispute between Democratic senators and the State Department counsel, Abraham D. Sofaer, over the Administration's contention that the 1972 ABM treaty can be interpreted to permit testing of certain components of the President's ''Star Wars'' anti-missile system. **********But Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said the condition had been carefully crafted to avoid reopening the specific ABM dispute and was simply intended to make sure that the interpretation presented at the time of treaty ratification was in fact the one that would govern the way the accord was carried out. **********Mr. Sofaer said today that Mr. Sarbanes and the Foreign Relations Committee report language he cited incorrectly stated the Administration's position on the treaty-interpretation issue.

''But the Japanese love big diamonds,'' she said. ''D.I.C. is working in Japan to promote the concept further.'' **********Ms. Phillips said a diamond ring would be a more suitable return gift than a diamond tie tack for American men. ''Because it has direct contact with the body, it's much more personal than tie gear.'' The industry's marketing people would like to see American women give the man their return-gift diamond wedding band at the ceremony, not at the engagement. **********Jeffrey Levitt, president of Alfred Levitt and Son Inc., manufacturers of bridal jewelry, agreed with Ms. Phillips's strategy of giving the ring at the wedding ceremony: ''The concept that engagement rings are only for women is too ingrained in men's psyche.'' The custom itself dates back to 1477 when Archduke Maximilian of Austria gave Princess Mary of Burgundy a diamond betrothal ring. **********But to Jane Goodman Baum, chairman and vice president of I.B. Goodman Inc., a New York jewelry manufacturer, the idea of a return gift has come of age. ''Our research shows when a man gives a woman a diamond engagement ring, she wants to reciprocate,'' she said. And, with more women in the workplace, women now have the earning power to return the favor. **********Diamond rings have been the most successful segment of the growing men's diamond jewelry market. In 1987 they accounted for 55 percent of the $1.3 billion retail men's diamond jewelry market. But convincing most men to wear diamond wedding bands isn't easy. N. W. Ayer's research shows that 25 percent of men would not consider jewelry under any circumstance; 75 percent would, but only if their wives bought it for them. **********Better designs may help break down this resistance. Current designs favor square cuts set low rather than high with prongs. ''A highlighted, solitaire stone is not considered as masculine,'' said Ms. Phillips. **********Mr. Levitt said DeBeer's may institute a national campaign to spread the return-gift idea, based on the results of testing they are doing. He believes that if DeBeer's puts money behind the concept, in five to 10 years, 50 percent or more of all grooms will have diamond wedding rings. **********The market is huge. There are 2.4 million marriages in the United States annually. The Diamond Information Center estimates that while 90 percent of men get wedding bands, only 16 percent get diamond ones. **********Tiffany's does not think diamond wedding rings, or any diamond rings, are appropriate for men. Peter Schneirla, group vice president of jewelry, said Tiffany's has historically maintained that diamonds are for ladies' fingers only.

Control Data and Primerica, formerly American Can, are among the major corporations that still occupy corporate buildings they have sold. **********The sale and leaseback is a maneuver that has been used by some major corporations as key aspects of reorganization programs. Eighteen months ago, in one of the largest such deals ever, the Union Carbide Corporation sold the 1.2-million-square-foot world headquarters it built in Danbury, Conn., in the late 1970's as well as most of the 600 acres of wooded property that surrounds it. **********Carbide Center, the headquarters building, was acquired by a group of investors known as Danbury Buildings Inc., and about 550 acres of the company's property was sold to Related Properties, a Manhattan-based real estate development concern.

Currently about 200,000 square feet of space in the headquarters building is available for sublet.

''But more companies that are not in trouble are discovering that corporate real estate can be used as a financial instrument.'' **********The sale of real estate is a way of raising operating capital without increasing corporate debt, Mr. Haggarty said, and sometimes agreements can be structured so that the cost of leasing is lower than the continuing expense involved in ownership. **********The buyer in the sale and lease-back deal benefits in the short term from an automatic rental income, and over the long term from the appreciation of the property. **********Mr. Haggarty said that the leaseback deals had become an accepted way of acquiring operating capital and that their popularity increased when interest rates went up. **********''If money is cheap, then companies do not want to be bothered with esoteric deals that involve selling property and negotiating leases,'' he said.

''The moment has come to examine the possibility of creating a European central bank that would manage a common currency,'' he said in a recent television interview. **********Although no one expects a powerful, Pan-European central bank to emerge next week or next year, many economists say France's sponsorship of such a move could pave the way for such a bank to be established in 5 or 10 years. Economic Pressures Build **********Indeed, calls for a European central bank are expected to crescendo during the next few years as Europe grows closer together economically and as more and more money crosses national borders. These trends will likely heighten exchange-rate pressures and reduce individual countries' control over their money supplies. A European central bank could help alleviate such problems. **********But creation of the bank faces strong opposition. On Thursday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said the idea of setting up a common bank was ''neither realistic nor of current interest.'' He added, however, that such a bank would be a sensible ''last step in the integration of Europe.'' **********German officials and economists fear that such an institution might adopt fiscal policies that put far more emphasis on economic stimulus and far less on fighting inflation than they would like. **********''As long as there are different priorities in economic policy from country to country in Europe, a common central bank is not feasible,'' said Hermann Rempsberger, chief economist for the Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank in Frankfurt. **********''The Bundesbank is a little bit more price-stability-oriented'' than some other countries' central banks, Mr. Rempsberger said. ''If we had a single central bank, we might find it very difficult to harmonize these different approaches,'' he added. French vs. Germans **********Many economists say French officials are vigorously calling for a European central bank because they are unhappy that West Germany -which stresses restrictive policies and anti-inflation measures far more than France - dominates the eight-nation European Monetary System. **********That system, founded in 1979, aims to maintain currency stability in order to encourage investment, growth and trade. Under the system, member nations pledge to keep their currencies from falling more than 2.25 percent (6 percent for Italy) below an index based on the average of Europe's currencies. Since the German mark and noninflationary German economy dominate the system, the other nations often have to keep their monetary and economic growth rates lower than they would like. **********French officials, troubled by an 11 percent jobless rate, are frustrated that they have had to keep their interest rates high in recent months to prevent the franc from falling below the monetary system's floor. **********''The French are keen on the idea of reducing the hegemony of the Bundesbank, and a European central bank would obviously be one way of overcoming that,'' said Brendan Brown, an international economist with County Natwest Bank in London. **********Since several or all the nations in the European Monetary System would place governors on the central bank board, the approach of such a bank would likely be more stimulative and less anxious about inflation than the Bundesbank. An Appeal to Britain **********Not surprisingly, at the same time that his Government was calling for a common central bank, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France called on Britain to join the European Monetary System. France wants Britain to provide a powerful, activist counterweight to Germany's slow-growth monetary and economic policies. However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain opposes joining the system because she does not want Germany's tight money policies to cramp Britain's economic independence. **********Economists say Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and Italy are likely to support a common central bank. What is more, Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank's president, said last May that he supports the creation of a European central bank and a single European currency as a ''long-term'' goal, but only ''if one guarantees that it has total independence from all political influence.'' **********Mr. Pohl recognized that the European Community's plan to establish an ''internal market'' in 1992 - aiming to erase borders for commercial and financial transactions - will increase the need for a common central bank. As exchange controls vanish, cross-border financial flows will increase, which can put more pressure on exchange rates and make it harder for individual central banks to monitor their money-supply growth. **********''One of the big reasons why it is appealing is it would eliminate some of the currency market instability that politicians are eager to avoid,'' said Chris Johns, an international economist with Phillips & Drew in London. **********He added that the main reason a central bank might never succeed is that ''nations are hesitant about giving up sovereignty over their monetary policy.'' Complex Questions **********Nations also might hesitate because setting up the bank would raise many complex technical questions. Some economists assert that the central bank could coexist with individual, national central banks, while others say it would have to supplant the existing central banks. In the view of these economists, coexistence means that the national central banks would never cede the new bank enough power to be effective. **********Similarly, some economists said the establishment of a common central bank would require a single uniform currency to replace the currencies of member nations. But other economists said the central bank could manage the money supply of the members even while these countries maintain their own currencies. **********Another point of debate is whether such a bank could be formed only after the member countries harmonize their economic policies or whether it could help bring about the harmonization. **********''Once we have coordination and harmonization, setting up a common central bank would be a logical last step,'' said Peter Pietsch, senior economist with Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. ''But if we harmonize policies and that helps stabilize exchange rates, then it wouldn't be so important to have a common currency and central bank.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/13/world/proposal-to-dismiss-charges-against-noriega-is-assailed.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1988-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 695, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Proposal to Dismiss Charges Against Noriega Is Assailed", "print_headline": "Proposal to Dismiss Charges Against Noriega Is Assailed", "body_text": " **********An Administration proposal to drop all drug-related charges against Gen.

D'Amato Assails Proposal **********In Washington, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, called the proposal to drop the charges a ''devastating blow to those of us who have been attempting to say that the United States is committed internationally and at home to the war on drugs.'' Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the offer ''would send a disastrous message in terms of drug fighting to Latin America.'' **********Panamanian opposition leaders expressed concern that the Reagan Administration might try to complete a deal without them. ''Unless General Noriega leaves the country you cannot have stability, which is precisely what Panama needs at the moment to recover its economic strength,'' said Gabriel Lewis Galindo, an opposition leader and former Ambassador to the United States. **********White House officials said dropping the indictments would be a useful lever to force General Noriega from power. **********''If you got a deal like that, it'd be the best plea bargain I ever heard of,'' the White House chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr., said today on ''The CBS Morning News.'' **********The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, who confirmed that the United States is ''still talking'' about a deal to drop the charges, said, ''What this amounts to is a plea bargain.'' **********Leon Kellner, the prosecutor who brought drug charges against General Noriega in Miami, met today with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d to argue against dropping the drug charges. **********Mr. Meese had expressed the concern of his prosecutors over dropping the indictments in discussions at the White House and elsewhere, a Justice Department official said.

The company recently reported a first-quarter profit of $85.4 million, up from $25.6 million a year earlier. Its stock, which traded as low as 5 7/8 after last October's market collapse, closed last week at 19 3/8. **********Bethlehem is not alone in its turnaround. In the last year steel companies have seen growing demand for certain products that have been in short supply, mainly steel plate used in heavy construction. Demand from makers of capital goods - machinery and equipment - has been particularly strong in the last two quarters. **********That and inventory rebuilding have helped create one of the most prosperous periods the American steel industry has seen in years. **********Moreover, in the last year, steel prices have increased an average of 8 percent. Prices of some products, such as plate, have soared as much as 50 percent. **********Conditions within the industry have inspired investors. Bethlehem initially intended to offer eight million shares. But the offering, which is being underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc., was oversubscribed. **********''The Bethlehem stock offering is an indication that people see better times ahead for the industry,'' said Leo J. Larkin, an analyst with the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''Bethlehem's stock had been up to about 21 but was off a bit because of the offering and the dilution of shares. But there is enthusiasm about the stock, and I think it has a lot further to go.'' **********The attractiveness of Bethlehem, as well as that of several other steel producers, reflects a growing excitement among many investors over the stocks of companies in basic industries. **********These companies have been beneficiaries of the weaker United States dollar and the higher output of American plants while foreign-made steel has been dealt a double blow: Government import quotas and higher prices for imported steel. **********''Bethlehem, like Deere and Caterpillar, is a concept stock,'' said John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. ''It reflects the prosperity of basic industry.'' **********Analysts, although not bullish on prospects for all the steel companies, are nonetheless encouraged by the industry's turnaround. ''On selective steel stocks, the prospects are good,'' said Mr. Larkin of Standard & Poor's. He said the outlook for Bethlehem and Lukens Inc. was especially good because those companies' products are more heavily weighted toward capital goods. ''Those companies sell a lot of plate steel, which is used in building bridges and manufacturing equipment, areas of the economy that are seeing growth,'' he said. **********The Inland Steel Company also has benefited from the industry's recovery, Mr. Larkin said. But he is less enthusiastic about Inland, he added, because it relies more than Bethlehem and Lukens on the flat-rolled products that go into automobiles and appliances. Growth in these areas has been less than robust. **********Other analysts, however, quickly point out risks that remain for the steel industry. **********For one thing, the new Administration in Washington will have to decide whether to extend the steel import quotas, which expire next year. How that issue is resolved will have a major effect on the steel industry. **********A less forceful quota program, especially for semifinished steel imports, would almost certainly lead to a production decline and lower prices, analysts say. **********Also, domestic demand has largely matured, and the substitution of other materials for steel is expected to continue. And, mini-mills, with their more streamlined processes, are likely to keep eroding the market share of the large integrated steel companies. **********Despite the risks, analysts contend that the steel industry's improvement will not be seriously hampered over the short term. In the years of huge losses between 1982 and 1986, steel companies lowered their break-even points through capacity reductions and cost-cutting. And many steel companies - notably Bethlehem, Inland and Armco Inc. - have had sizable equity issues, strengthening their balance sheets by reducing debt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/world/canada-endorses-us-trade-accord.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1988-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CANADA ENDORSES U.S. TRADE ACCORD", "print_headline": "CANADA ENDORSES U.S. TRADE ACCORD", "body_text": " **********The House of Commons voted early today to give final approval to the Canada-United States free-trade agreement, effectively clearing the way for the agreement to go into operation as scheduled on Jan. 1. **********The Commons vote, 141 to 111, marked a turning point for Canada, which had considered rejecting its high-tariff policies in favor of free trade with the United States three times in the past century but had rejected the move each time. **********Since the agreement has already been ratified by the United States, the Canadian action also sealed what the Reagan Administration has hailed as its most important trade breakthrough, the creation over a 10-year period of a largely free market of 270 million people. **********When the Commons vote was tallied at 1:49 A.M., only two steps, both essentially pro forma, remained in what has been a bitter 14-month struggle to ratify the accord.

This is a deal that we don't want to fix up.'' **********Under Mr. Hoffman's six-year tenure at the USX railroads, the company has developed new transportation services, allowing the company to be more responsive to its customers, about half of which are USX operations. **********By combining the rail, barge, and shipping operations under one management, Mr. Hoffman said he expected even greater synergy among his existing businesses and increasing competitiveness with the trucking industry. Transtar also expects to expand its business territory, now centered in the Great Lakes and Middle Atlantic regions and the South, Mr. Hoffman said. **********The son of a banker in Pittsburgh, Mr. Hoffman attended West Virginia University, where he earned a degree in industrial management before joining the Air Force. After attending the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Industry, he joined the United States Steel Corporation as a operations trainee and worked his way up through the ranks as a labor relations specialist. **********In 1982, Mr. Hoffman, who served as chairman of the public transportation body that developed Pittburgh's new subway system, took control of the steel company's railroad group. He and his wife, Mary, have four sons between the ages of 17 and 30 and live in Mount Lebanon, Pa."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/business/the-credit-card-wars.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1988-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Credit Card Wars", "print_headline": "The Credit Card Wars", "body_text": " **********THE New York Stock Exchange was threatened. With its slow, anachronistic trading methods it was losing business to a new, competing market. **********The situation may sound familiar, but the year was 1869. The exchange's system of auctioning each stock for just a short time each day was being challenged by another market - the Open Board of Brokers - where shares were bought and sold throughout each session. Investors preferred the continuous market. The New York Stock Exchange finally insured its survival by adopting the new system. **********Once again, the exchange finds its livelihood under attack. The threat comes not so much from the pressure for reform that has developed in the wake of last October's market crash, as it does from the fundamental shift in the investing practices of the exchange's biggest customers - large pension funds and money managers that account for more than half of all trading. **********Instead of trading shares of individual companies one at a time, these institutional investors are increasingly buying and selling ''baskets'' or diversified collections of shares using several different methods, some of which are known popularly as program trading. And they are doing so in any manner they can: through the Big Board's own electronic trading system, known as SuperDot; through stock index futures contracts, mostly those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which allow the investor in one step to buy the equivalent of a basket of stocks, and through complicated strategies that play off both the New York and Chicago markets. But because of the efficiency of trading stock index futures, Chicago is winning a growing share of the business that traditionally would have stayed in New York. **********So while politicians and academics debate the problems in the marketplace that were exposed by the chaotic plunge last October, the New York Stock Exchange has already set in motion important changes, both in its philosophy and in the way it conducts its business. Some of them deal with the possibility of another market crisis, but most go to the heart of the shift in trading strategies. And almost all mean significant upheaval for the exchange: *********** It is planning to introduce its own basket contract, the cash equivalent of a stock index future. *********** The exchange is exploring a reduced role for the floor brokers, called specialists, who control trading of individual stocks. These brokers are likely to lose their exclusive access to valuable information on the flow of certain buy and sell orders - known as a limit order book - putting more investors on an equal footing. *********** It is considering a rule that would stop all trading if the market rises or falls beyond a set point on any day, called a circuit breaker. Such a rule is a hallmark of commodity futures markets, which have traditionally functioned with daily price limits. *********** It is weighing the use of call auctions whenever there are order imbalances that threaten to shut down trading in individual stocks. These auctions - a throwback to the pre-1869 era - would act to ease volatility by giving investors more information about order flows. The call auction is designed to bring balance into an unsettled market by making available more information on the accumulation of buy and sell orders. **********The changes indicate the degree to which New York is adopting the basket trading techniques that are modeled on Chicago's futures markets. **********''What they're trying to do is adopt the innovations of their competitor, recognizing the economic reality,'' said Hans Stoll, a professor at Vanderbilt University's business school, who drew the analogy with 1869. **********Roberta S. Karmel, a member of the exchange's board of directors and a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, put it more directly. ''This is an organization with a very strong instinct for survival,'' she said. ''And I think that instinct is working now.'' **********MANAGING the critical transition is John J. Phelan Jr., the Big Board's chairman, who is trying to sell the changes to a large and cumbersome board of directors and a nervous group of floor specialists. He must also gain the acceptance of a Wall Street community divided between retail brokerage firms, which share the public's fears about program trading, and institutional firms, whose customers have embraced the basket approach. **********If Mr. Phelan succeeds - and most think he will - the process of trading stocks will become much more like trading commodities. By making the shift, the exchange hopes to regain some of the clout that it has lost in recent years to Chicago. **********''There has been a fundamental change in the way that some institutional trading is being done,'' said David S. Ruder, the chairman of the S.E.C. ''What the market must do is deal with that phenomenon.'' **********The pending moves are ''an acknowledgment of the commoditization of the stock market,'' said Donald Stone, a senior partner of Lasker, Stone & Stern, a specialist firm, and vice chairman of the Big Board. **********Not everyone thinks such changes are necessarily better. Some argue that they are likely to produce more volatile stock prices over all. And the changes suggest that the prices of individual stocks will be influenced more and more by macroeconomic developments that affect the overall market and less and less by the prospects of the company that issued the shares. **********Those side-effects may prove troubling for smaller investors, since they represent such a marked shift from the traditional style of investing in particular stocks. **********The changes are already well under way. The circuit-breaker concept, although still needing regulatory approval, was adopted by the exchange this month, Mr. Phelan said. He added that the rule would only go into effect if all other markets, including stock index futures exchanges, adopt similar circuit breakers and if there is a ''sunset'' provision for the rule to be re-examined every year or so. **********An exchange task force is expected to complete its design of a basket contract in the fall. It is possible, too, that the contract would be traded without a specialist. The trading might be done instead with a system of competing market makers - or even in a pit with open outcry, as in Chicago. If this were to happen, a possibility that Mr. Ruder said he is encouraging the Big Board to consider, it would mark the first time that floor trading of stocks would occur outside the specialist system. **********The exchange's technical staff is already working on the specifics of how it will open up the specialists' book to all investors. And the call auction proposal is also well advanced, Mr. Phelan said. **********The changes highlight the remarkable philosophical odyssey the Big Board has taken since the Oct. 19 crash. **********At that time, the exchange fiercely resisted the notion that it should ever be closed down in the face of wildly volatile trading, preferring to deal with that problem on a stock-by-stock basis. And it spoke out strongly against program trading and its presumed role in the crash. Indeed, comments by Mr. Phelan fanned public concerns over this often-misunderstood trading technique. **********SEVERAL different trading techniques come under the basket trading rubric. In the basic form of basket trading, an institutional investor buys or sells a large number of stocks simultaneously, usually with the help of computers. The investor can also buy or sell stock index futures contracts. **********The more complex strategies involve trading between the stock and futures markets. In index arbitrage, the investor watches for discrepancies between the level of the stock index future and the actual value of the stocks that make up the index. The investor then buys the cheaper of the two while simultaneously selling the more expensive. Some investors switch their baskets from one market to the other, depending on which is the cheaper of the two. **********The President's commission on the October crash and the S.E.C. blamed some forms of program trading for exacerbating the collapse in share prices. That conclusion spurred calls for measures to cut back on program trading and the use of stock index futures. In fact, the Big Board responded by instituting a ''collar'' that would shut down all program trading done through the exchange's electronic order system if the Dow Jones industrial average rises or falls more than 50 points in one day. **********But participants in the Chicago futures markets, who are major contributors to political campaigns and adept in the ways of Washington, have stanched further efforts to cut back on basket trading. An interagency review board led by the Treasury Department delivered a stunning victory to Chicago several weeks ago when it proposed that there be no basic changes in the way the stock index futures markets operate. **********And since the crash, many institutions have kept their billions of dollars in funds that use the basket strategies, maintaining pressure on the Big Board to adapt to their strategies. Thus, the tone at the exchange has shifted dramatically. **********''We've got major institutions that have found the futures and basket trading to be useful,'' Mr. Phelan said in a recent interview. ''How do you tell them not to use them? That's like resisting tomorrow. What Chicago wants is to be considered a major player. Well, they are a major player, not because of what they've done, but because of who uses them.'' **********INCREASINGLY, investors have been ''voting'' on their view of the economy - and where the overall market should be - not by buying stocks, but by going to Chicago. The prices of the individual stocks traded in New York then adjust to the level of the stock index futures, a classic case of the tail wagging the dog. **********To be sure, the Big Board runs the New York Futures Exchange, which trades its own stock index futures contract. But New York was late entering the financial futures arena and its contract has failed to draw the interest that Chicago's product has. **********''The New York Stock Exchange has lost its role as the locus for price discovery of the market,'' said one large fund manager devoted to the basket approach. ''It lost that when it ceded the stock index futures to Chicago.'' **********Reflecting this fact, volume in the stock index futures market has soared. In fact, the value of trading the most popular contract, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Standard & Poor's 500 index, is now significantly higher than the average daily value of trading on the Big Board. **********The growth of the stock index futures market is regarded by many experts as just a symptom of a more fundamental economic force - the desire of large institutions to avoid the risk and inefficiency of trading one stock at a time. The introduction of stock index futures in 1982 made basket trading more feasible and cheaper. **********''The real breakthrough was developing ways to trade baskets,'' said Roger M. Kubarych, the former chief economist for the Big Board and now an associate at Henry Kaufman & Company Inc., an investment firm. ''It didn't have to be through stock index futures. It was just an accident of history that they came first and that the battle has been over futures. The issue is baskets.'' **********The futures provided a way for investors to buy, with one contract, an instrument that rose and fell with the price changes of hundreds of individual stocks. To do this they had to put up only 5 to 10 percent of the value of the stocks. **********The large institutional funds that engage in basket trading take the position that, on average, the probability of beating the market, or market indexes, by picking the best performing shares is lower than the probability that they will underperform, or pick losers. So they construct a portfolio that produces the same return as the average by investing in all the stocks that make up the index, a strategy known as ''passive'' investing. Thus, when the funds move money into or out of the fund, they buy or sell simultaneously all the stocks in the index - a basket trade. **********Attracted by the logic of basket trading strategies, huge sums of money from pensions funds, endowments and other institutions have poured into so-called index funds. Index funds are not the only investors to use the basket approach, but they are the largest. And the approach is not limited to stocks. Large sums are also being invested in indexed corporate bond funds as well as funds that take an indexed approach to foreign stock markets. **********According to a recent survey of managers of large index funds conducted by Pensions & Investment Age magazine, the funds managed $161.4 billion in assets as of last Nov. 30. Of that total, $107.5 billion was in domestic stocks, with the rest in indexed bond and international stock funds. One large index fund manager, Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, handles $45 billion in domestic stocks. **********SOME of the more traditional investors do not see the basket approach as much of a threat because they are convinced they can still beat the average return that basket investors seek. **********''This hasn't changed what we do a bit,'' said Robert G. Kirby, chairman of the Capital Guardian Trust Company and a member of the Presidential task force that studied the crash, who manages $15 billion in old-fashioned, ''active'' stock portfolios. Like other active managers, Mr. Kirby combs through company reports trying to pick winners. **********''What they're doing is great as a theory,'' said Mr. Kirby of the basket investors. ''But to me the market has as many anomalies as ever. It's woefully inefficient, and that creates opportunities.'' **********MANY Big Board watchers attribute the sudden rush of developments to the peculiar consensus style by which the stock exchange operates, with its cumbersome 27-member board made up of many different constituencies. The board rarely takes the lead in economic or political developments, but tends to follow policies that already appear to be emerging in public debate, or in the marketplace. Clearly, a consensus appears to be developing on some of these issues, and the exchange is quickly following the mood. **********The changes also owe much to Mr. Phelan's pragmatic approach to the needs of the exchange's customers and the direction that the political winds are blowing. For instance, he expresses little enthusiasm for the idea of a circuit breaker, yet is facilitating its adoption. ''Even if you don't think it's a good idea,'' Mr. Phelan said, ''you have to go ahead with it'' because of the growing demand in Congress for such a move. **********In an earlier battle, Mr. Phelan fought off critics of automation of the trading system because he foresaw the increasing demand for the efficiencies of electronic enhancements. ''Some people on the floor have never forgiven Phelan for that,'' said one trader. ''But we survived because of what he did.'' **********Now the specialists are concerned about Mr. Phelan's new agenda. At a private luncheon meeting last Tuesday with Richard Grasso, the Big Board president, representatives from five leading specialist firms spoke of their fears. Privately, some specialists have threatened a battle. **********But the overall mood may be more accommodating. ''We're going into the new world cautiously,'' said Mr. Stone, the specialist. ''We're moving with an awareness that change is afoot, but wanting it to be done intelligently.''  THE EVIDENCE ON VOLATILITY **********AS basket trading has grown, so has the perception that it has made the market more volatile. Among academic specialists, this is a highly contentious subject, but there are now signs that the perception, at least in some respects, may well be true. **********Lawrence E. Harris, a specialist in markets who teaches at the University of Southern California business school, found that on average the price of a stock jumps about 3 percent the day it becomes a part of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, perhaps the most popular basket trading vehicle. The volume of trading in the stock also triples for a few days, Mr. Harris found. **********While short-term adjustments may not be surprising, Mr. Harris's research also showed that the prices of stocks in the S. & P. 500 are regularly about 5 percent more volatile than those outside the index. And that volatility, he said, has been increasing. **********There are some explanations now for what may lie behind the increased volatility. The answer, some believe, is in the notion of liquidity. **********In the 1960's, institutions sought more efficient ways of trading large amounts of stock. If they wanted to sell a 100,000-share block, for instance, it was impossible to go to the floor of the exchange and find one buyer. The order had to be broken up into many smaller trades, an inefficient and expensive method and a sign that the floor lacked the liquidity for trades of that size. **********The solution was to arrange these block trades away from the exchange floor, in what is known as the upstairs market, where significantly more capital is available. **********The advantage of this method was that brokers could probe the market, that is, they could call big investors and other brokers to determine the level of demand, or they could buy the shares themselves. It amounted to a sort of informal auction, spreading information and then balancing supply and demand. **********Program trading has reversed that process. Big basket trades route orders directly back to the floor specialists through the exchange's electronic Designated Order Turnaround system, known as DOT. **********''This is putting a lot of pressure on the floor, where you have insufficient liquidity,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, a professor at New York University's business school. **********John J. Phelan Jr., the exchange's chairman, added: ''What you had before was that you probed the market when you wanted to sell. With the advent of a way to route these orders directly into the system, that kind of probing has been bypassed.'' **********Nonetheless, it is still not clear that the relatively small jump in volatility noted by Mr. Harris has created the huge daily market swings that concern many traders. For instance, other academics have pointed out that on several occasions there has been far more program trading than on Oct. 19, and yet on those days the market hardly moved at all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/22/business/company-news-airbus-would-like-us-assembly-line.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airbus Would Like U.S. Assembly Line", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Airbus Would Like U.S. Assembly Line", "body_text": " **********Airbus Industrie, the European airplane consortium that captured nearly 25 percent of the world market for new jetliners in 1986, wants to set up an assembly line in the United States with an American aerospace company as a partner, a senior executive said.

He had been asked whether the men would consult their wives before taking the vital decision on when to return to Afghanistan. **********Sadia Ansari, a young teacher, was asked what had changed in the lives of women since they went into exile. ''This,'' she said, pointing to the veil she wore over her head. ''Purdah.'' She was referring to the custom of Moslem traditionalists of cloistering women from the view of outsiders by making them stay indoors and wear a veil in company. Fundamentalists Dominate **********The customs of Mr. Mohammad, the farmer, have been imposed on the educated women of Kabul like Miss Ansari in their exile in Peshawar and the refugee camps. Moreover, the dominance of Islamic fundamentalists in the war against the Soviet-backed Afghan Government and among the three million refugees in Pakistan has made the life of the village women even more restricted than it was at home. **********''The women are the main victims of the war,'' a refugee official said. **********Even before the establishment of a Communist Government in Kabul and the Soviet intervention in 1979, middle-class Afghan women had made significant progress toward liberation from Islamic orthodoxy. They wore Western clothes, went to university and held a range of jobs in Kabul and other cities. **********In the countryside, Afghans tended to live in villages populated largely by members of their tribes, clans and extended families. Even conservative Moslems, as Afghan villagers were, allowed the women of their families to be outside the house when the only men likely to see them were connected by such ties, particularly since much of the field work was done by women. No Fields to Be Tilled **********Life in the large and densely populated refugee villages has changed all that. Since there are no fields to be tilled or animals to be tended, the need for women to leave the house has diminished. At most, they go to the camp well to draw water, veiled and averting their faces from all men. **********With the certainty of encountering men from other families and tribes, the men - who make up 26 percent of the refugee population, compared with 30 percent women and 44 percent children under 13 - have imposed rigorous purdah throughout the camps. In four weeks of visiting camps, this reporter has not been allowed to talk to single woman. Any hut that he asked to visit was cleared of all females before he was permitted to enter. **********Miss Ansari and her principal, Tajwar Kakar, were interviewed at a girls' school run by the International Rescue Committee, an American voluntary organization, in Peshawar, a city near the border that is the unofficial capital of the Afghans in exile. **********Even the men who impose the restrictions speak with sympathy of the deprived lives of women as refugees. ''The women are like birds in a cage,'' a guerrilla commander who gave his name only as Mohammad in the Lakhti Banda camp south of Peshawar. ''They have only their housework and nothing else to do. They are not happy.'' **********''The women are confined,'' said an anthropologist working for an international organization . ''They used to do most of the routine agricultural labor. They got out of their houses because village life was much more homogeneous. Now they have no work and no reason to leave the house, while there is a high likelihood of being seen by men from outside the family.'' Boredom and Melancholia **********Refugee men, as well as Pakistani and foreign refugee workers, consider boredom and melancholia the woman's lot in all of the mud-hut camps that line the border. For the two Afghan women interviewed, it was the gravest problem of refugee life. **********''Camp life is so sad,'' Miss Ansari said. ''They cry from morning to night. In Afghanistan, the wives' life was very happy. They worked; they brought their husbands their food. Now they have nothing to do.'' **********The more the young teacher spoke of the sadness of the Afghan women, the more agitated she became and the less she cared that the black veil that she wore over her head without covering her face slipped off completely. An educated middle-class woman from the capital, she finds even limited purdah a new experience. **********''At home, sometimes I wore a little scarf,'' Miss Ansari said, scoffing at the bigger shawl of black cotton that is her concession to the prevalent traditionalism. **********''At home, when men came to visit, I stayed in the room,'' she said. ''Here I have to go away.'' **********''We had more liberty in Afghanistan,'' said Mrs. Kakar, the principal, who comes from Konduz, near the Soviet frontier. ''We went anywhere we wanted, even at night.'' Tradition Is Strong **********Despite the men's realization of the special difficulties of women's lives, tradition is so strong that it excludes the possiblility of lifting the isolation that makes their exile life more miserable than that of men. **********''We won't permit the women to go outside, even if we lose our lives,'' said Mr. Mohammad in the Thal camp. ''The only people they can meet are the women of our tribe. It's our religion.'' **********Scholars believe that the tribal customs of the Pathans, who live on both sides of the Pakistani-Afghan border, impose much greater isolation on women that Islam requires. **********''Most of the women want psychotherapy for depression,'' said Dr. Shehide Qazi, a Pakistani and Pathan who works at a woman's clinic run by the French International Action Against Hunger for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. ''They are sad and worried. I tell them the Afghan problem will be settled and they can go home. I just comfort them. In bad cases, I give them Valium.'' **********Asked how the women react to her comforting, she replied, ''They just keep quiet.'' **********Just to persuade the men to let the women come to the clinics in the camps is considered major progress by the relief organizations. Trust Has to Be Built **********''The women now come because the men know their women are safe,'' Dr. Qazi said. ''It takes a lot of time to build up community trust. They won't come if you don't prepare them mentally. The outreach workers go through the camps to prepare them.'' **********''Oh no, not women,'' the doctor said when asked about the outreach workers. ''They are men; they talk to the men. The men have to give permission for the women to come.'' **********Beatrice Koekoek, administrator in Quetta for the French organization, said, ''We have to fight with the men to take women to a hospital when necessary.'' **********The clinics have become the only social centers where Afghan women can meet women from outside their family circle. **********''If they're lucky, their husbands let them go to the basic health units,'' she said. ''They sit around and chat. That's why the doctors report that so many of the women have only minor complaints. To go to the doctor is their only chance to get out of the house.'' **********In all the camps visited, the clinics were always surrounded by women sitting and chatting. And always they hastily drew their veils and averted their heads at the arrival of an outsider. Photographs are possible only at a distance, with a telephoto lens. Most Schools for Boys **********As in health, in education as well the international aid organizations come up against the resistance of Afghan men. The camp schools run by relief agencies under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner are in the great majority for boys. There are 486 primary schools for boys and 76 for girls, 161 middle schools for boys and 2 for girls, and 4 secondary schools, all for boys. **********Total enrollment in the United Nations schools stands at 104,600 boys and 7,800 girls. **********''We are pushing very hard for more girls' schools,'' said Anne Willem Bijleveld, deputy chief of the High Commissioner's mission in Pakistan. ''But we have to respond to demand. It would be pointless to establish schools if you don't have the pupils or the teachers.'' **********Boys go to school for as long as possible, said Mohammad Mukhi, a 30-year-old principal of a primary school in Surkhab camp near Quetta. Girls leave school at age 10 or 11. **********''Then they go to weave carpets,'' Mr. Mukhi said. Intelligence Doesn't Matter What if a girl is particularly intelligent? ''Whatever her intelligence, at 10 or 11 she has to go to weave carpets,'' he replied. ''All the men think so.'' **********''I don't think it's bad for women to become doctors,'' Mr. Mukhi said, ''but it's better to weave carpets. They can start earning money from a very young age.'' **********An old man who gave his name only as Marjin, sitting on a rug in his hut in a camp near Thal, was asked how the women felt about their life in the isolation and boredom of exile. **********''They say, 'We are refugees. We have to live like this.'

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, suggested considerable misgivings in the party about the development of a critical press, a key aspect of Mr. Gorbachev's campaign to increase openness in Soviet society. **********His proposals to reshape the political system, outlined in a speech he delivered Tuesday at the opening of the conference, produced a spirited, sometimes pointed debate over specific aspects of his plan. But they were generally overshadowed by other issues today. Colloquium and Catharsis **********Delegates, with the clear blessing of Mr. Gorbachev, abandoned the normally stilted style of official Soviet meetings and turned the assembly today into a freewheeling discussion that included elements of a graduate-school seminar, a town meeting, a revivalist gathering and a national catharsis. **********The diversion of attention from Mr. Gorbachev's proposals appeared to reflect an expectation among delegates that the conference, deferring to the Soviet leader, would approve most of his recommendations before adjourning later this week. **********The real drama of the meeting seems likely to revolve around questions like how much freedom the press should have. Dual Role for Gorbachev **********Mr. Gorbachev, among other things, proposed creation of a powerful new post of president of the Soviet Union and a partial transfer of power from the party to popularly elected legislative bodies. **********It is commonly assumed among Russians and Western diplomats that Mr. Gorbachev would serve as president while retaining his position as party leader, evidently hoping to enhance his power and ability to steer the country in new directions. **********The spontaneity today seemed genuine enough, with several speakers all but run off the stage for making self-congratulatory remarks. Impressions of the meeting came from abbreviated, edited television broadcasts and briefings by party officials. The meeting itself, in the Palace of Congresses in the Kremlin, is closed to foreign reporters. **********The gathering of 4,991 delegates, the first special party conference since 1941, was suggested by Mr. Gorbachev last year in the hope of gaining a renewed mandate for change. The conference has the power to set national policy, order a reorganization of the political system and rule on other sensitive matters, including the limits of glasnost, or openness. **********Seventeen delegates, limited to 15-minute appearances on the podium, addressed the conference today, bringing to 24 the number to have spoken since Mr. Gorbachev finished his three and a half-hour speech Tuesday afternoon. Party officials said 206 delegates have requested time to speak, and the officials indicated that the conference might be extended into the weekend. **********Yuri A. Sklyarov, a party spokesman, gave journalists a detailed account of today's proceedings at a briefing tonight, reporting that most speakers, with some minor reservations, had supported Mr. Gorbachev's blueprint for restructuring the political system. A Conspicuous Omission **********He said that several key Gorbachev recommendations, including creation of a new presidency with powers to oversee domestic and foreign policy, had not been mentioned during the discussion. **********Mr. Sklyarov reported that many of the speakers criticized the Soviet press for being imbalanced, inaccurate and excessively negative, while others complained about economic problems, particularly bureaucratic obstacles preventing the decentralization of the economy that Mr. Gorbachev advocates. **********Yuri V. Bondarev, a writer who has often criticized colleagues for failing to emphasize positive aspects of Soviet life, lashed out at the press for presenting a distorted view of Soviet society, naming the weekly magazine Ogonyok as a prime offender. **********Svetlana I. Fedotova, an elementary school history teacher from Perm, an industrial city in the Urals, deplored the absence of reliable textbooks and said that newspapers and magazines had failed to fill the vacuum because they often published inaccurate or biased information. Gorbachev Seizes the Moment **********In one of the day's more dramatic moments, Mr. Gorbachev, seated behind the lectern at the center of a long row of party officials, interrupted a speaker to interject his own thoughts about the state of the press. **********Stabbing the air with his fingers to punctuate points, and addressing the hall in the tone of an instructor leading a graduate seminar, Mr. Gorbachev called for an unemotional assessment of glasnost. **********''We have to try not to replace one semi-truth with another,'' he said, as the speaker, Mikhail A. Ulyanov, one of the country's best-known actors, turned to face him. **********Mr. Ulyanov, defending the press, had called for increased protections against censorship. Glasnost Is One Thing . . .  Although the Soviet leader said that openness was essential, he added that the press must be responsible. **********The exchange was broadcast on television as part of a condensed report of today's debate. **********Several delegates responded to remarks made on Tuesday by Leonid I. Abalkin, an economist, who had questioned aspects of Mr. Gorbachev's plan for political change and charged that the Soviet leader's economic policy was not working. **********During his appearance Tuesday, Mr. Abalkin, according to Mr. Sklyarov, delicately questioned whether the Gorbachev goals for making the Soviet Union more democratic could be achieved with a one-party system. Bluntness From Arbatov **********Georgi A. Arbatov, a Central Committee member and expert on the United States, told the meeting that Mr. Abalkin's view of the economic situation was too grim. **********Joining the debate about whether party leaders should have fixed terms in office, another Gorbachev recommendation, Mr. Arbatov seized the attention of the hall when he said, ''If Stalin had retired in 1934 and Brezhnev had left office in 1974, we would have avoided many painful problems.'' **********This moment was also broadcast as part of the abbreviated television coverage. **********Mr. Gorbachev proposed that party officials, in all but exceptional cases, hold office for no more than two five-year terms. Stalin ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years and Brezhnev for 18. Of Mice and Mechanisms **********The unquestioned star of today's session was Vladimir P. Kabaidze, the director of a machine-building plant and an outspoken party member who at one time, before Mr. Gorbachev assumed power in 1985, was forced from work because of his unorthodox views. **********A balding, wiry figure somewhat out of place behind the imposing wooden lectern, Mr. Kabaidze used his 15 minutes to deliver a blistering criticism of the failures of the economy and of the efforts by centralized ministries to manage industrial enterprises. **********Speaking in a staccato, stream-of-consciousness style, Mr. Kabaidze said: ''Let the ministries catch mice. If they don't, they don't eat.'' **********''I can't stand this proliferation of paperwork,'' he added. ''It's useless to fight the forms. You've got to kill the people producing them.'' Smiles of Recognition **********The delegates greeted his most stinging criticisms with applause, and Mr. Gorbachev and other members of the Politburo broke into smiles as the plant director spoke. His entire appearance was shown later on television. **********Two speakers, according to Mr. Sklyarov, were prevented from completing their prepared remarks when the delegates, in the Soviet equivalent of a Bronx cheer, started slow, sustained applause. **********One speaker, an official in the Moscow party organization, was praising the group's work when the derisive applause began. **********''They did not exactly boo him off the stage or throw tomatoes, but there was a lot of exaggerated applause,'' Mr. Skylarov said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/28/business/market-place-specialists-seek-deeper-pockets.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1988-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 830, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Specialists Seek Deeper Pockets", "print_headline": "Market Place; Specialists Seek Deeper Pockets", "body_text": " **********IN the wake of October's stock market collapse, the nature of the specialist system at the New York Stock Exchange appears to be changing as old-line partnerships are acquired by large investment banks. Several acquisitions have been made in the last six months, and talks are under way about a number of other deals. **********Drexel Burnham Lambert is aggressively seeking specialist firms on both the New York and American exchanges, and is considering deals involving firms on other exchanges, Drexel officials said. Several other investment banks are quietly exploring similar acquisitions, according to people familiar with the discussions. **********''There are a lot of firms that are getting interested in the specialists now,'' said one adviser to several firms. ''It's a profitable venture. And if you have the right hedging techniques, it can become very profitable.'' **********Specialists stabilize the market for particular stocks by buying when there are no other buyers and selling when there are no other sellers. They assume the obligation in return for an exclusive franchise to deal in the stock on an exchange. They also act as agents for brokers, who leave orders with them for execution. **********Problems can arise when huge amounts of stock are traded in a single day and the specialists do not have the liquidity to cover all the transactions. Since the October collapse, that hazard has been cited for the growing concern about the specialists' capital position. One result has been that capital requirements have been increased for specialists on the New York Stock Exchange. These changes in the system are occurring amid a growing interest in specialist firms by brokerages, an interest that has been a long time developing. **********In 1986, the Big Board approved a provision known as Rule 98 that allowed business combinations by the brokerages and the specialists. But the combinations would be permitted only if brokerages established strict confidentiality standards, setting up so-called Chinese walls between the specialist units and other operations. **********Some industry officials remained concerned, however, about potential conflicts of interest, as well as about the possibility that brokerages could steal business by capitalizing on the close relationship specialists have with the companies whose shares they handle. **********In response to those concerns, the Big Board restricted brokerages from acting as the lead underwriter and specialist in the same stock. No brokerages were willing to operate under those terms, industry officials said, and none applied to acquire specialist firms. **********After the October market crash, the Big Board revised Rule 98, temporarily suspending the provision on lead underwriters. The suspension, which is scheduled to end Monday, was intended to attract more capital to the system, Big Board officials said. **********Since the suspension began, several brokerages have acquired or entered joint agreements with specialists. Drexel has a joint venture with Carl H. Pforzheimer & Company; Merrill Lynch & Company acquired A. B. Tompane & Company, and Bear, Stearns & Company acquired the specialist operations of Asiel & Company. **********Interest in acquisitions strengthened in recent weeks after the Big Board formally filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission asking that the lead-underwriter provision of Rule 98 be abolished. **********The S.E.C. has said that, despite the Monday deadline, the suspension of the provision will remain in effect until it rules on the request, New York Stock Exchange officials said. **********The officials' interest in bringing investment banks into the specialist system can be simply explained: Oct. 19 demonstrated the need for specialists to be heavily capitalized. **********''The specialist operations in the past have been limited in a world that has become very capital intensive,'' said Thomas A. Russo, a securities lawyer with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a former staff lawyer with the S.E.C. ''You want to have firms that are well capitalized, and to do that, you have to allow the big players in.'' **********While brokerages are wanting to buy, many specialist firms are eager to sell. Small partnerships have traditionally dominated the specialist field, and many of them were frightened by the maginitude of the October collapse. **********''The owners of these franchises are re-evaluating their risk-reward,'' said an official with one Wall Street brokerage house. ''These have been individual partnerships. But suddenly the stakes have gone up, and a lot of the old partners have been frightened.'' **********The situation appears ripe for more combinations of specialists and brokerages. **********''As the game gets bigger,'' one Drexel official said, ''The specialist units are going to depend more on the institutionalized capital.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/19/business/company-news-meritor-financial.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Meritor Financial", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Meritor Financial", "body_text": " **********Meritor Financial Group's drive to restore profits is being slowed by rising interest rates, Frederick S.

Gen. H. M. Ershad, reached individual agreements with India and other neighboring countries for cooperation. But he has thus far failed to win sufficient support for a regional response to the flooding. **********''What we want is a regional water authority, including the five concerned countries, to regulate and harness water resources for the benefit of all,'' Mr. Choudhury said in an interview before his address. This would mean no diversion of water, construction of dams or other such projects, without common consent, he said. Looking to Dutch and Germans **********He said such a regional agency would need international support both in technology and financing because of the magnitude of the problem. Specifically, it would look for technological help from the Netherlands and West Germany, ''which have cooperated successfully in taming the Rhine,'' he said. **********Bangladesh and India have been at odds for some time over the control of the waters of the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other common rivers. Bangladesh accuses India of permitting rampant deforestation that has resulted in flooding, and building dams that divert badly needed water from Bangladesh in the dry season. Specifically, these officials are concerned over an Indian proposal to build a canal across Bangladesh to drain water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges system. **********The Bangladeshi official said his Government has tried to generate enthusiasm for regional cooperation. Ershad and Gandhi Meet **********He noted that General Ershad and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India agreed late last month to set up a joint task force to study the flood management and water flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Subsequently, the President visited Nepal, and it was agreed to set up a joint study team on the problem. He will also visit Bhutan this week and later China to take up the same issue. **********Referring to the recent catastrophic flood, Mr. Choudhury said 1,250,000 houses were destroyed, leaving about eight million people homeless. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to the flooding. **********The Foreign Minister said the country's ''highest priority needs'' are now wheat and construction materials. **********Emphasizing the need for a permanent solution to the problem, he said, ''The primary imperative will be in harnessing regional cooperation among all our concerned neighbors with a view to arriving at coherent and well-coordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/14/world/montreal-journal-in-plain-english-printer-s-sign-is-a-cause-celebre.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1988-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 966, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Montreal Journal; In Plain English, Printer's Sign Is a Cause Celebre", "print_headline": "Montreal Journal; In Plain English, Printer's Sign Is a Cause Celebre", "body_text": " **********Allan Singer has paid a price for his principles, and whether that makes him courageous or stubborn could get you a good argument in many of this city's bistros and bars. **********So far, Mr. Singer has appeared in court 45 times and spent $120,000 of his own and his supporters' money defending his right to hang a battered sign outside his stationery store in this city's Notre-Dame-de-Grace district. The sign was simple, an ocher-colored board proclaiming ''Allan Singer Ltd., Printers and Stationers,'' but it contravened a 12-year-old law that made it an offense to hang a sign in anything but French in Quebec, where 83 percent of the 6.5 million people are French-speaking. **********Mr. Singer could have settled the matter in 1978 by paying a $25 fine and hauling down the sign. But the stationer, now 76 years old, stuck with his legal battle - and with his sign, until faltering business caused him to move his business two years ago, and the billboard was too big to hang on the railings outside - all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court. Argument on the case was heard in November, and the court's ruling is expected before the justices rise for the summer. New Political Battle Feared **********Most legal experts expect Mr. Singer to lose on the ground that his sign was not written in English and French, Canada's two official languages. But along with the Singer ruling, the court will hand down its decision on another case heard in its November session, involving a Montreal-based retail chain, Brown Shoes Ltd., that was prosecuted because it included English alongside French on its signs. Hundreds of other cases against shopkeepers who hung out bilingual signs depend on the outcome of the Brown case. **********If the court finds in favor of the shoe company, as is widely expected, it could set off a bitter political battle. Language issues have been explosive here since the British defeat of the French garrison at Quebec City in 1759, and there are fears that a new struggle over the primacy of French could re-ignite the passions among French-speaking Quebecers that led to a high tide of the Quebec separatist movement in the 1970's. **********For the moment, Quebec appears to be as stable as at any time in years. After its landslide defeat of the separatist Parti Quebecois in the 1985 provincial election, the Liberal Party of Premier Robert Bourassa negotiated an agreement that renewed Quebec's commitment to the Canadian confederation. That deal, involving recognition of Quebec as a ''distinct society'' in the Constitution, has yet to receive the assent of several provinces, but opinion polls show that it has the strong support of Quebec's French-speaking majority. **********Mr. Bourassa made a pledge to the province's 800,000 English-speakers during the 1985 campaign to allow bilingual signs, but after the election he hesitated, saying that most English-speakers placed a higher priority on ''social peace'' - meaning harmony with the French-speaking majority - than on their right to post signs. 'Persecution and Bullying' **********When Quebec's highest court ruled 5 to 0 in favor of bilingual signs in the Brown Shoes case, in December 1986, the Premier instructed the province's lawyers to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The decision set off a round of skirmishing among militants, who want to influence the Premier before he decides, as he is constitutionally empowered to do, whether to override the Supreme Court's eventual ruling. **********Mr. Singer, the stationer awaiting the Supreme Court ruling, compared the climate to the ''persecution and bullying'' by Nazi Germany that caused him to volunteer for combat service with Canadian forces in Europe during World War II. Attired in a battered pin-stripe suit, he described with indignation how provincial investigators visit the store incognito, looking for stationery items with English-only markings. ''I can spot these fellows now, when they start coming in here and sniffing around among the rubber bands and paper clips,'' he said. **********On the opposite side of the dispute is the powerful Quebec nationalist group, the Societe St.-Jean-Baptiste, which has been barnstorming the province warning of a betrayal of the gains won by the Parti Quebecois. Nicole Boudreau, the 38-year-old former journalist who heads the society, aims to collect 101,000 signatures on a petition demanding that Mr. Bourassa stick by Bill 101, the 1976 law that established the primacy of French as the province's working language, as the language of instruction for most immigrant children - and as the only language to be used on signs. **********Mrs. Boudreau depicted French language and culture as being at inescapable risk - ''like a sugar cube beside a coffee pot'' - because of Quebec's position as the only predominantly French-speaking jurisdiction in a continent with 270 million English-speakers. The electoral defeat of the Parti Quebecois had fostered a climate of lethargy on the language issue among the province's ''most dynamic elements'' that could lead to the ''Louisianization of Quebec,'' she said. **********But at Alliance Quebec, the English-speaking lobby group that has financed many of the legal challenges to Bill 101, there is not much tolerance for the province's argument before the Supreme Court that freedom of expression for English-speakers is not reduced because they are obliged to hang out signs in French. **********''You might as well say, 'You have the right to say what you want as long as you say it in Swahili,' '' said Michael O'Keefe, an Alliance official who speaks fluent French.

The Sandinistas were rarely able to force them to stand and fight, and when they did, the contras lost. **********A provision of the agreement reached by the two sides two weeks ago, however, prevents the contras from remaining hidden in the forested mountains of Nicaragua. It provides that they are to move into yet-to-be defined cease-fire zones during the first 15 days of the truce. **********When this occurs, the Sandinistas will know the whereabouts of the contras and can attack them if the truce breaks down and fighting resumes. One American military officer said that for the Sandinistas it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. ''The contras have had it,'' he said. A Defeat Two Weeks Ago **********American officials, who were surprised by the cease-fire agreement, said the contras had not been defeated in the field even though two weeks ago they suffered a defeat in a Sandinista offensive in the Bocay Valley. These officials point out that the Sandinistas stopped short of overunning a key contra headquarters and supply depot in the region. If they had done so, it would have been an even more serious blow to the contras. **********The Administration assessment that the contras could have continued to fight appears accurate based on discussions with both contra and Sandinista officials. **********The contras reportedly have not suffered high casualties in recent fighting, and they stockpiled enough arms and ammunition before American military aid was cut off in February to allow them to operate at a modest military level for many months. Some American officials expected them to adopt just such a strategy in hopes that the United States would eventually resume military support. **********The contras also operated freely and in considerable strength in four mountainous provinces of Nicaragua, Jinotega and Matagalpa in the north, Chontales in the central region and Rio San Juan in the south. At the time of the cease-fire, 8,000 to 10,000 armed contras remained inside Nicaragua. Despair Over Aid Seen **********The fact that the contras agreed to a truce is seen as an indication that they despaired of getting American military aid soon. **********The contras could resume their war by slipping out of the cease-fire zones and back into the forests where their supplies are undoubtedly still hidden. A few may do this if they become dissatisfied with the negotiations with the Sandinistas, but for all practical purposes the contra military arm has been neutralized by the cease-fire. **********Even if the contras had not agreed to enter cease-fire zones, they would have difficulty resuming military operations if negotiations broke down. Guerrilla forces such as the contras are emotionally committed to their cause, and that is what sustains them in the face of adversity and deprivation. But once an event like a cease-fire causes an insurgency to lose its momentum, it is difficult to maintain morale, much less resume fighting quickly. **********It has not been precisely clear what the Administration and the contra leadership actually hoped the contra fighters would achieve in their war. Five years ago, the Administration said the contras were putting pressure on the Government in Managua to dissuade it from supplying arms to a Marxist insurgency against the American-backed Government in neighboring El Salvador. To this date, the amount of support provided by the Sandinistas to the Salvadoran guerrillas has never been established conclusively. Overthrow Was the Hope **********As the insurgency grew less threatening in El Salvador and the contra movement grew larger in Nicaragua, the goal of the contras was said to be to bring pressure on the Sandinistas to make democratic changes. It was an open secret among contra leaders and many people in the Administration, however, that the hoped-for goal was the overthrow of the Sandinista Government. **********In the last year, the Sandinistas were worried by growing contra strength and effectiveness. But few military specialists believed the contras could defeat the Sandinista army and oust the regime, even though the contras scored some impressive victories in Nicaragua in 1987. Experts in insurgent warfare said the contras needed to create political appeal throughout Nicaragua and, most important, an urban insurgency to match the one in the countryside. **********Opposition to the regime exists in Nicaraguan cities, but there is no known underground movement that could try to overthrow the Government. Counterinsurgency experts point out that the Minister of the Interior, Tomas Borge, with the help of Cuban and Soviet bloc security advisers, has established an effective police apparatus that prevents the contras from establishing an underground in Nicaragua's cities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/31/business/more-cigarette-exports-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Cigarette Exports Seen", "print_headline": "More Cigarette Exports Seen", "body_text": " **********Cigarette exports are expected to rise sharply this year, largely because of growing demand in some Asian countries, according to an Agriculture Department analysis. **********An increase of 10 percent, to 110 billion cigarettes, is forecast, the department reported. **********''Recent efforts to lower trade barriers in Japan, Taiwan and now, South Korea, are having a major impact on U.S. cigarette trade,'' the report said.

Withdrawal Plan **********Under the United Nations plan, officials say, Morocco will withdraw about two-thirds of its estimated 150,000 troops from Western Sahara. The Polisario will then confine all its forces -estimated by the United Nations to number between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers - to camp under United Nations supervision. In a third stage, Morocco will confine its remaining troops to camp under United Nations supervision, with the United Nations choosing campsites far from polling places. **********United Nations officials say their peace plan tries to capitalize on the Polisario's weakness and on growing signs that Morocco and Algeria are tired of the war. **********The Governments of Algeria and Morocco, enemies for decades, are increasingly preoccupied with similar internal problems, diplomats report, including efforts to restructure their economies and pay off huge foreign debts. The two countries restored diplomatic relations in May and then held direct talks in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. **********At present, the United Nations plan gives the territory's indigenous people, who number about 400,000, a choice between becoming an independent state and remaining part of Morocco. **********But United Nations officials are encouraging a compromise giving the people a third choice: a loose form of federation with Morocco. **********The officials say they are not convinced that Morocco would ever completely surrender sovereignty over the territory.

Below it is a logotype designed by the agency, one person's hand atop another person's hand in a consoling manner. **********The telephone number in the advertising copy is not yet in service. **********A single visit will cost $100 and the center will suggest quarterly tests. **********Mr. O'Connell, 53 years old, was a counselor and then principal of Bethpage High School until 1980. He got out of the education business and into health care when he established the Ovex Fertility Corporation, which later went public. The company has six physician-staffed offices that gives couples help, for a fee of $2,000 to $20,000, with infertility problems. **********Ads for the company ran with the headline, ''Sometimes it takes more than love to make a baby.'' **********As many as 900 couples a month visited the offices and many of the women were artificially inseminated with donors' sperm. However, the AIDS crisis has drastically cut into the number of people willing to undergo insemination. Then the October stock market crash eliminated many couples who previously would have spent the money. **********The first AIDS center will open later this year at 1625 Third Avenue at 92d Street and negotiations are under way for a second further downtown. Mr. O'Connell has plans to take the concept to other cities as well, noting that one has already been started in San Francisco. **********What is preventing Mr. O'Connell from giving a specific date for the beginning of the ad campaign is the need for a proper liability-insurance policy, since the enterprise could be destroyed by a lawsuit should there be a misdiagnosis. **********The agency's approved media plan calls for ads in New York and Long Island newspapers, on radio and in transit advertising. **********Sturtevant & Hildt was begun two and a half years ago by Mr. Hildt and Robert S. Sturtevant, who died in January. It is a subsidiary of AC&R/ DHB & Bess, which is part of the empire of Britain's Saatchi & Saatchi. **********It is billing about $11 million from such clients as the New York Racing Association; Connoisseur, a Hearst magazine; MGM/UA Home Video, Central Federal Savings of Long Beach, L.I., and the Bide-A-Wee Home Association, an animal welfare organization. **********And it has added Safecom to the roster thanks to the good offices of a creative guy at another agency who plays tennis with Joe O'Connell and put in the good word."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/03/business/finance-new-issues-connecticut-and-los-angeles-make-large-debt-offerings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Connecticut and Los Angeles Make Large Debt Offerings", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Connecticut and Los Angeles Make Large Debt Offerings", "body_text": " **********Competitive bond issues dominated the tax-exempt market yesterday with Connecticut and Los Angeles issuing $312 million of debt securities. **********Underwriters led by Citicorp made the winning bid on a $182 million issue of Connecticut general obligation bonds.
