A year and a half ago, he was convinced that he was going to be executed, that only Allah could save him. **********As it happened, Rachid Ghannouchi, who has spent 5 of his 48 years in prison, was, rather mercifully, sentenced to life imprisonment on Sept. 27, 1987, after a trial of 90 Islamic militants; seven of his comrades were condemned to death. **********The executions were never carried out, because on Nov. 7, 1987, Habib Bourguiba, the country's 84-year-old President-for-life, was ousted by his Prime Minister, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Last May, Mr. Ben Ali, now President, pardoned Mr. Ghannouchi and let Tunisia's Islamic genie out of the bottle. **********Some 2,500 supporters of the outlawed Islamic Tendency Movement marched out of jail and into the swirl of Tunisia's first free parliamentary elections, which were held on April 2. The electoral law tipped all 141 parliamentary seats to Mr. Ben Ali's ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally, but nominally independent candidates loyal to Mr. Ghannouchi's banned party won 14.5 percent of the vote, demonstrating that it was one of the strongest fundamentalist movements in the Arab world. No Risk-Free Options **********A man of mournful countenance set off by dancing brown eyes, Mr. Ghannouchi incarnates the trickiest challenge facing Mr. Ben Ali as he seeks to endow Tunisia with something resembling a democracy. If the President legalizes Mr. Ghannouchi's renamed Renaissance Party, it may well enlarge its following, particularly in municipal elections next year; if it festers in the twilight of illegality, it will almost certainly expand its extensive underground network, cloaked in mystery and martyrdom. **********''We believe that the decision to legalize our party should be made soon, because we have respected the law,'' Mr. Ghannouchi said in halting French, sitting behind a simple desk surrounded by a clutch of aides who interjected their own views from time to time in Arabic and French. ''Our activity is not a revolutionary one. It is more one of reform.'' **********Even before the election, Mr. Ghannouchi had won a string of symbolic victories from Mr. Ben Ali. Mr. Bourguiba had little time for Islamic tradition - he once outraged the faithful by sipping orange juice in front of television cameras during the Ramadan fast - and he clearly saw the rise of the Islamic Tendency Movement as a threat to his secular, modernizing legacy. Invoking Allah, for a Change **********In his first words to the nation on Nov. 7, 1987, President Ben Ali set a new tone, invoking ''Allah the compassionate and merciful'' to justify his coup d'etat. Since then he has multiplied such gestures, having himself filmed at prayer in mosques and making the pilgrimage to Mecca. **********The President has restored the independent status of the ancient Zitouna theology school, suppressed by Mr. Bourguiba, and has created an agency for religious affairs. The call to prayer is now broadcast five times a day on television, and the broadcast of a major European championship soccer game a few nights ago was interrupted so that a cleric could intone the official start of Ramadan. **********Tunisian soccer players now sometimes wear long, baggy shorts that cover their knees out of deference to the Islamic injunction to modesty. Before the elections, thousands of Tunisians thronged an exhibit here on the mosques at Mecca and Medina, with women standing in one line and men in another. **********Startled by the Renaissance Party's impressive showing in the cities, where it draws its recruits from teachers, low-level bureaucrats, artisans, traders and the unemployed, some secular-minded Tunisians argue that Mr. Ben Ali has already gone too far and that he has legitimized Mr. Ghannouchi's program. The next Bourguiba legacy to be sacrificed, they predict, will be the Monday-to-Friday work week, which interferes with the Muslim sabbath. The Pen Belies the Words **********Yet the core calculation President Ben Ali must make is whether to believe the sweet words of moderation that flow from Mr. Ghannouchi's mouth - in the awareness that the cleric's pen has attacked ''a West in revolt against God'' and that extremists in his ranks denounce Tunisia's ''corruption'' with the vehemence of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. **********A onetime philosophy teacher in a Tunis high school who styles himself ''emir,'' Mr. Ghannouchi sampled several varieties of politics during wanderings through Syria, Egypt, France and Iran, and after Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979, the Tunisian was caught up in enthusiasm for the Iranian revolution. But now, as he puts it, he has ''registered not a few reservations'' about the Iranian upheaval, notably its sectarian Shiite cast. **********''We are in principle against executing people for their ideas,'' said Mr. Ghannouchi, asked about the violent repression of dissent in Iran. ''If that is happening in Iran, we are against it.'' **********It is this kind of conditional answer that makes some Tunisians and many Western diplomats believe that Mr. Ghannouchi is speaking with a forked tongue. One European ambassador said flatly, ''Islam is simply a way for these people to conquer power in Tunisia.'' A Greater Tolerance **********But others say that prison and experience have tempered Mr. Ghannouchi and his closest collaborators and that, as their movement expands, it inevitably reflects the relatively tolerant qualities of Tunisian society. Michel Camau, a French academic authority on Tunisia, noted that Westernizing and Islamic currents have since the 19th century vied for control of the country's nationalist movement. **********''They are certainly not anti-modernists,'' Mr. Camau said of the Renaissance militants. ''They are in fact reformers who are seeking a synthesis between modernity and Islam.'' **********Last December, Mr. Ghannouchi visited Islamic centers in St. Louis and Washington. He said he was awed by the ''strength, riches, liberty and scientific development'' that he saw but also by ''the monumental buildings in which people live.'' **********From the dusty, second-floor office from which he exercises considerable spiritual and political influence in Tunisia, Mr. Ghannouchi observed, ''I am not sure that man is very happy in these monumental buildings.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/18/business/defaults-up-on-debts-owed-us.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1989-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1098, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Defaults Up On Debts Owed U.S.", "print_headline": "Defaults Up On Debts Owed U.S.", "body_text": " **********Delinquent debts that farmers, students, veterans and taxpayers owe the Federal Government have more than doubled in the Reagan years despite stepped-up efforts to curb it, the White House is expected to report later this week. **********Advance copies of the President's annual management report on the Government, prepared by the Office of Management and Budget, show that the total delinquent debt grew every year, from $42.7 billion in 1982 to $83.2 billion in 1987 and to $88.7 billion last year. **********Uncollected income taxes account for the bulk, $56.6 billion, and loans for the rest. 'People Pay for a While' **********''It just continues to grow,'' said James C. Miller 3d, economist at the Citizens for a Sound Economy, a research group here, and until October the director of the budget office. ''There's so much of it out there. People pay for a while, but then they get into a nonpayment status.'' **********Despite the Reagan Administration's frustrating efforts at better debt collection, the Bush administration is likely to study what can be done on that front. Better debt collection would bring in revenue and reduce the Federal budget deficit without raising taxes. **********Some debtors are people who borrowed to pay college tuitions or buy homes and fell behind on payments because they lost income or became disabled. Others are tax scofflaws and people who simply put off debt payments and never resumed them. **********The delinquent loans also include those made by Government agencies and those that were made by banks and backed by the Government. More Enforcement Pledged **********Soon after President Reagan took office, he promised to increase enforcement to collect delinquent loans, including many involving Federal employees who had earlier taken loans the Government makes to students and veterans. **********The management report faults the Justice Department for some of the difficulty. ''Debt collection litigation must compete with other priorities in the U.S. Attorney offices, such as prosecution of drug dealers and organized crime,'' the report says. **********''Significant backlogs in debt collection litigation have developed, with bankruptcy and foreclosure cases referred by Agriculture and defaulted student loan cases from Education and Veterans' Affairs, creating particularly serious workload problems,'' it adds. **********The figures would be significantly larger had the Government not sold some loans to private investors at bargain prices, used private collection agents and attorneys to collect back payments, and garnisheed many debtors' tax refunds and wages. **********It also reduced the outstanding debt by determining last year that $11.3 billion was impossible to collect. That sum was removed from the totals. In 1987, the Government wrote off $4.2 billion as uncollectible debt. 'Tempting Territory' **********''They're probably going to have to find some way to raise revenue,'' said John H. Makin, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, referring to the Bush administration, ''and this strikes me as tempting territory for bargaining with Congress.'' **********Reagan Administration officials attribute the surge in delinquent debt partly to the high-risk liability the Government assumes as a lender to people who cannot borrow from private lenders, to constraints Congress imposes against collection of loans to some groups, to lax lending standards in the 1970's and to its forbearance in cases of people who fall on hard times. **********These include the farmers who were struck by the prolonged recession in agriculture in the first half of the 1980's and those hurt by the continuing weakness of the oil patch economies of the Southwest. Criteria Less Stringent **********In addition, the Government, unlike private banks, lends to promote such goals as assuring college educations for young people and homes for veterans and farmers. It therefore uses less stringent criteria in making loans than banks do and runs a greater risk of delinquency. **********''We have been concentrating a lot of these programs on the less affluent, where you would expect higher default rates,'' said Rudolph G. Penner, economist at the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. **********Mr. Penner said it took money to collect money and said the Reagan Administration's emphasis on spending restraints might have been counterproductive. Justice Department Priorities **********But Mr. Miller said the problem arose because of the priorities the Justice Department set. ''Going after deadbeats is something that is not nearly as sexy as going after drug dealers,'' he added. **********The report said the Justice Department had embarked on ''a multi-faceted strategy to reduce the current inventory of 84,000 cases valued at over $7 billion'' that had been referred to it. **********Unpaid taxes, the largest portion of the delinquent debt and also the fastest growing, raises questions about the overhaul of the tax system that the Administration and Congress enacted in 1986. By eliminating loopholes and special breaks, the Government hoped to discourage tax avoidance. But since 1966, tax delinquency has grown faster than in previous years, from $41.9 billion in 1986 to the $56.6 billion of last year. Varied Measures Used **********To reduce delinquencies, the Administration has resorted to a variety of enforcement measures. Last year, the report says, the Government collected $236 million by withholding tax refunds due on taxpayer returns and an additional $82 million that people paid upon receiving letters theatening them with cuts in their refunds. **********In the case of its own payroll, the Government has started withholding up to 15 percent of the take-home pay of Federal employees who have become delinquent on loans. During 1987 and 1988, the report said, 140,000 such workers were found to owe $500 million, and in those cases, it added, ''the offset procedures are being implemented.'' **********The President's management report is one of the series of documents that the budget office prepares as part of the budget proposal that the President submits to Congress. More Use of Technology **********The report examines the Government from a management perspective, and among other things, the report recounts the growing use of computers and other technology to improve Government efficiency. **********For example, it says that a widespread use of Diners Club cards by agency employees has helped reduce the cost of processing expenses and that the number of Federal workers who are paid electronically, with automatic deposits in their bank accounts, has jumped from 18 percent in 1981 to 80 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/06/business/bache-draws-a-censure-from-sec.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1989-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bache Draws A Censure From S.E.C.", "print_headline": "Bache Draws A Censure From S.E.C.", "body_text": " **********Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. was censured yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission for numerous violations of securities laws governing accounting procedures and operational controls. **********The securities firm settled the S.E.C. charges without admitting or denying guilt. Although the firm will not be fined, it will be required for two years to maintain reserves in cash or securities significantly above those mandated by law. It will also be required to take steps to prevent a recurrence of the problems. **********The charges involved $218 million worth of securities the firm was required to hold for customers but had sold and used in other transactions. The S.E.C. also charged that the firm was unable to determine whether the value of its reserves was accurate because of errors in the formula used to calculate the reserves. The charges also said that the firm had failed to maintain a record of its customer reserve allocation for one day, and that its general ledger on two days was inaccurate by $28 million. Protection Rule Violated **********''What you've got here is a firm that violated the most important customer protection rule regarding the safeguarding of customers' funds and securities,'' said Martin A. Kuperberg, associate regional administrator of the New York office of the S.E.C. ''The commission took this case very, very seriously.'' **********In a statement, Prudential-Bache said the violations, which it described as ''purely technical in nature,'' occurred in areas that the firm ''felt needed improving.'' The statement added that the violations did not have an effect on client accounts. **********A number of the violations involved so-called custody repurchase agreements that the firm had with customers. Under such agreements, a firm sells a security at the same time an agreement is reached to repurchase the security on a specified date. **********Under such agreements, brokerages are required to hold the securities as collateral for what essentially amounts to a loan. The arrangement is typically used for overnight or short-term placements of blocks of securities. **********The S.E.C. said Prudential-Bache sold securities that were being used as collateral in a custody repurchase agreement. The firm also purchased, but did not receive, 38 security positions that had been pledged as collateral for such agreements. In addition, the firm did such repurchases for security positions that it did not own and for securities that were subject to a lien. The transactions occurred in February and March 1988. Unable to Verify Reserves **********In addition, the S.E.C. charged that Prudential-Bache violated the securities laws because the firm was unable to determine whether its computation of reserves was correct. At least four significant errors were misstated in that computation, the S.E.C. charged. The commission also said that its checks of the firm's net capital computation had revealed inaccuracies on two occasions. **********Moreover, the firm failed to maintain a record of its customer reserves on Sept. 25, 1987, and made errors in its receivable and payable balances from its syndicate fees, the S.E.C. charged. **********Under the terms of the settlement, Prudential-Bache has agreed to a number of Government restrictions, in addition to holding the additional money in reserve. The terms of the settlement require the firm to establish new policies regarding compliance in the division responsible for custody repurchases within the next 120 days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/25/business/company-news-1992-whets-bsn-s-big-appetite.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1989-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "1992 Whets BSN's Big Appetite", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 1992 Whets BSN's Big Appetite", "body_text": " **********France's largest food company, BSN Groupe, is making a name for itself as a young giant in a hurry as it jockeys for position in the unified, barrier-free market that the European Community envisions for 1992. **********In a whirlwind of deals engineered by Antoine Riboud, BSN's 70-year-old chairman, the company has begun to chip away at the gap between it and Europe's two food giants, Nestle of Switzerland and Unilever, which is Dutch- and British-owned. **********''BSN is by far the most aggressive group in France in preparing for 1992,'' said Alain Kerfourn, an analyst with Sellier S.A., a Paris brokerage. ''Mr. Riboud thinks it's better to attack than defend.'' 'Extremely Fast Change' **********BSN, a 23-year-old concern that is best known in the United States for its Dannon yogurt, Evian mineral water and Kronenbourg beer, joined with Italian partners last week to buy Galbani, Italy's largest cheese company, for $1.35 billion. A month ago, BSN bought Henninger Hellas, Greece's No. 2 beer company, and in June it paid $2.5 billion to RJR Nabisco for five biscuit and snack food operations in Britain, France and Italy; it has since sold two of those companies to Pepsico for $1.35 billion. **********''We're in a period of extremely fast change, and if you see something pass in front of you, you have to seize it,'' said Mr. Riboud (pronounced ree-BOO), a straight-talking, animated man. ''It won't pass in front of you again.'' **********The acquisitions should lift BSN's net income to about $375 million on sales of $8 billion this year, up from $342 million in profits on sales of $6.6 billion in 1988, said Joanna Clapp, an analyst who follows the company for Hoare Govett, a London brokerage. **********Mr. Riboud says BSN has to hurry not just to compete with other food companies, but to keep up with the growing power of supermarket chains that are linking across borders and television networks that are starting to broadcast throughout Europe. The goal is to transform BSN into a powerhouse with plenty of strength to bargain with broadcasters over advertising rates and with supermarkets over product display. **********The core of Mr. Riboud's strategy is to expand as fast as possible and across as many European borders as it can. BSN has made close to 30 acquisitions or mergers in the last three years, and its revenues are expected to reach $8 billion this year, more than twice those in 1983. Some recent acquisitions include La Familia, a pasta manufacturer in Spain, and HP Foods, a British sauce company. **********In Mr. Riboud's view, becoming a multinational, multiproduct company is vital in keeping up with the growing global reach of food retailers. For example, three of Europe's largest supermarket chains - Casino of France, Ahold N.V. of the Netherlands and the Argyll Group of Britain - recently agreed to cooperate in purchasing and marketing. **********''If the retailers are making purchases in different nations, then I have to be in those nations to serve them,'' Mr. Riboud explained. ''I have to be ahead of them. If I am not ready, then the distributor might pick another multiproduct company to be its supplier. I must become European before they do.'' **********Like most modern executives, Mr. Riboud loves to talk about synergies and economies of scale. He says BSN can save money by having its trucks carry not just cookies, but cookies and mineral water. He sees savings in marketing because one advertisement can be beamed to a dozen countries, with only the voice-over changed. **********Mr. Riboud sees another important reason for expanding beyond France. ''If my consumer goes to Spain on vacation and drinks Heineken beer because he can't find Kronenbourg there, he might continue drinking Heineken when he returns home,'' he said. '''I have to follow my consumer all over. I have to keep him from from picking up bad habits.'' **********This helps to explain the moves last year to take a 50 percent stake in Maes, Belgium's second-largest brewer, and a 20 percent interest in Peroni, Italy's biggest brewer. Mr. Riboud wanted those links to insure that his flagship brand, Kronenbourg, is distributed in other countries. **********Mr. Riboud - who seems to view Europe as a chessboard full of pieces to capture - makes his acquisitions with another aim: to be No. 1 or No. 2 in each of BSN's markets. His acquisition of RJR Nabisco's cookie operations propelled BSN from Europe's third-biggest cookie maker to No. 1. What is more, BSN is first in Europe in dairy products and mineral water. It is second in beer sales, behind Heineken, and third in champagne. **********Mr. Riboud noted that many supermarkets carry only three brands of a product. ''That's why it so important to be first or second, or, in extreme circumstances, third,'' he said. **********The next step after acquiring famous brand names is to exploit them. Thus, in announcing the Galbani acquisition last Wednesday, BSN said it would use its distribution network to help expand Galbani's well-known brands, including the Bel Paese and Santa Lucia cheeses, well beyond Italy. Similarly, Galbani's distribution network will help push BSN's Dannon and Gervais dairy lines deeper into Italy. **********Broadly speaking, Mr. Riboud believes it is especially urgent to jump into southern Europe. ''Industrial consolidation is pretty much complete in Britain, West Germany and Belgium, and is almost complete in France, but it is not at all complete in Italy and Spain,'' he said. ''We have to act when the opportunity is still there.'' **********Mr. Riboud not only appreciates Italian cuisine, he loves the growth prospects for Italian food. He sees pasta marching over the Alps and winning the hearts and palates of Europe, helped by the increasing popularity of microwave ovens and growing concerns about consumption of animal fats. **********''Southern cuisine will conquer northern Europe just as Mexican food has crossed the border into the United States,'' he said. **********For now, Mr. Riboud says he is so busy in Europe that he has no plans for a large expansion in the United States. He has made some small American acquisitions, including Scharffenberger Cellars, a California champagne company, and Lea & Perrins, the Worcestershire sauce maker. There have been suggestions that BSN might be willing to sell the United States operations of Dannon, the leading American yogurt, to raise money to expand in Europe, but Mr. Riboud dismisses them. ''I don't want to let one of the great names go,'' he said. Began as a Bottle Maker **********BSN's drive to build a food empire began a little more than 20 years ago, not long after Mr. Riboud, who never attended college, became head of Souchon-Neuvesel, a Lyons-based bottle-making business run by his uncle. In 1966, Souchon-Neuvesel merged with Boussois, a flat-glass company, to form Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel, soon renamed BSN. **********Mr. Riboud saw hard times ahead in the glass industry as more food and beverages were packaged in paper and plastic. Having failed in 1968 to acquire Saint-Gobain, France's largest glass company, in the country's first hostile takeover battle, Mr. Riboud concluded that he did not have the capital to compete in packaging. His survival strategy was to buy the things that would fill his bottles. In 1970, he purchased Kronenbourg and Evian, beginning BSN's dizzying ascent in the food industry. **********Mr. Riboud's current goal is to give BSN five pillars, areas in which it hopes to stand up against, and perhaps outperform, Nestle and Unilever. He will let Nestle dominate in chocolate and coffee, and Unilever in detergents, while BSN concentrates on dairy products, beer, mineral water, cookies and grocery goods. **********BSN has formed many alliances to enable it to expand without ruining its balance sheet. The recent flurry of acquisitions has raised its debt equity ratio to 75 percent, from 30 percent. **********Perhaps BSN's most important ally is the Agnelli family, which has helped open doors in Italy. In last week's acquisition, BSN acquired 35 percent of Galbani while IFIL Partecipazioni, an Agnelli holding company, took 65 percent. BSN also cooperated with the Agnellis in 1987 in acquiring a stake in Sangemini, an Italian mineral water company, and last March in acquiring a stake in Star, a large Italian grocery group. **********''In countries like Spain and Italy, one needs a godfather, and we chose the best possible godfather,'' Mr. Riboud said. **********The Agnellis could also help protect Mr. Riboud from what he fears the most: a takeover. BSN acquired a small French bank to make sure that any purchaser would require the approval of French banking authorities. BSN has also approved an anti-takeover ''poison pill'' that would trigger a share issue, equal to 25 percent of its equity, if a hostile bid began. Questions About a Successor **********Some analysts say the biggest challenge facing BSN is to find a successor for Mr. Riboud. A workaholic who is more a strategic thinker than a hands-on manager, he nonetheless has not hesitated to tell managers how to consolidate operations. **********Some analysts speculate that if raiders do pounce, they will wait for him to step down. But that is not likely to be soon, since Mr. Riboud has asked shareholders to extend BSN's mandatory retirement age to 80, from its current 75. **********Asked about his plans for retirement, Mr. Riboud acted in part insulted, in part too preoccupied to think about it. ''We're in a very special period,'' he said, ''the construction of Europe.''

''But it is also good that they're returning to their homes.'' **********The dramatic slowing of emigration after East Germany's decision to open its borders Thursday night should give its Government much needed breathing space to address other acute problems. It also has brought relief to West Germans who were bracing for a new flood of refugees. Estimated 1 Percent Settling **********Of the 60,000 East Germans estimated to have visited Helmstedt since Friday morning, less than 1 percent have sought to settle in West Germany, the town manager, Lothar Wien, estimated. ''Most people are going back because they want to work tomorrow as usual,'' he said. **********A similar phenomenon was witnessed this evening along the entire border between the two countries. The Government in Bonn reported that, excluding Berlin, 540,300 East Germans entered the country between 2 P.M. Saturday and 2 P.M. Sunday, but that only 3,742 had applied to become immigrants. **********The Government added that it had no accurate calculation of the number of East Germans who had visited West Berlin in recent days. Between Thursday night and Sunday, a total of 4,950 East Germans filed requests in Berlin for the right to migrate to West Germany. **********At Ehra-Lessien, 40 miles north of here, more than 1,000 East Germans who arrived last week through Czechoslovakia were moved out of an army camp to make way for a fresh wave of immigrants. **********But by this evening, with immigrants being funneled deeper into West Germany, the Government had not made use of the camp. **********The West German Red Cross even disclosed tonight that some East Germans who fled here in recent weeks were now planning to return home. The East German Government will reportedly set up offices at the four main border crossing points in the coming days to handle emigrants who have changed their minds. Girding for More Visitors **********Nonetheless, though the miles-long jams of cars entering West Germany began to ease Sunday evening, some East Germans were still arriving here for their first visit to the West. **********''We expect more visitors tomorrow and throughout the week, and probably as many visitors next weekend as we've had this weekend,'' Mr. Wien said. ''The East German Government says it has already issued over 4 million visas.'' **********The sight of old-fashioned East German Trabant cars chugging along the autobahns 200 or more miles from the border indicated that many visitors had grabbed the chance to visit relatives deep inside West Germany. As they headed back eastward this afternoon, West Germans gathered on bridges over highways, waving to them cheerfully. **********Many visitors have waited in traffic jams for between 5 and 10 hours to enter West Germany since Friday. Even with East Germany adding eight new crossing points today to the traditional four, travelers had to wait in lines that stretched as long as eight miles to return home tonight. **********Many of their old cars broke down, forcing West German repairmen to improvise. ''It's very difficult because we have no spare parts for their cars, which have very old mechanical systems,'' said Rainer Bengsch of the Government Highway Assistance Service. Stores Ordered to Remain Open **********The mood among the visitors, however, was one of universal delight. ''I never thought I would ever come over here,'' Silvia Meyenkoth, a 27-year-old secretary, said, adding that her three previous requests for an exit visa had been refused. ''I can't stop crying, with the emotion.'' **********In Helmstedt as in other West German towns and cities, the authorities have donated 100 West German marks, the equivalent of $54, as ''welcome money'' to each visitor. ''This morning we had some scuffles because we had 12,000 people in the square here waiting for their money,'' Mr. Wien said, ''but we managed to clear the backlog in less than one hour.'' **********West German shops are prohibited by law from opening on Saturday afternoon and Sunday. But Mr. Wien said he ordered that some shops remain open through the weekend so that visitors could take home a souvenir of their visit. ''We even had a Sunday street market for the first time ever,'' he said. **********One problem has been finding beds for those spending the night here. Many families have invited East Germans into their homes, and schools, churches and other buildings have been turned into temporary dormitories. Beer, Sausages, New Friends **********In Helmstedt's main square tonight, stalls were set up to serve beer and sausages to the visitors, with a local band providing live entertainment. ''I waited to see people going over on television before I was ready to believe this,'' said an 18-year-old girl who arrived this evening by train for a two-hour visit here. **********Ines Wohling left her two children at home in nearby Eilsleben and came over with her husband to visit a long lost aunt. Later, however, they met some West Germans, she said, ''and now we're going to spend the evening with them.'' **********One 65-year-old man who gave his name only as Gunther L. - ''We don't know what will happen next week,'' he explained - said he had lived in Helmstedt until 1946. **********Only now was he able to visit the old friend who took over his house here, ''but we arrived too late,'' he said sadly. ''The friend is dead.'' To Shop, or Window-Shop?  For many visitors, the greatest excitment was the opportunity to shop, or, in many cases, just go window-shopping. ''It looks as if people design everything with love here,'' Mrs. Meyenkoth said, ''but I'm going to look carefully before I spend my money.'' **********Some shops here pasted signs on their windows reading ''We greet our fellow countrymen from East Germany.'' While the official rate of the East German mark to the West German mark is one to one, only a few visitors here were willing to accept the offered rate of 10 East German marks for one Deutsche mark. **********''I earn 800 marks per month and keep my family on it at home,'' one man said, ''but for 80 Deutsche marks I can buy very little.'' **********The one item many visitors could not resist buying were bananas, which apparently are rarely available in East Germany. ''Now we know that humans are not descended from monkeys,'' Gunter L. said, roaring with laughter at his own joke, ''because we have survived for 40 years without bananas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/world/central-american-nations-urged-to-take-lead-on-refugees.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 459, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Central American Nations Urged to Take Lead on Refugees", "print_headline": "Central American Nations Urged to Take Lead on Refugees", "body_text": " **********The United States and other Western countries have approved a plan by five Central American nations for resettling the roughly two million people driven from their homes in the region by more than a decade of strife and civil war. **********But the aid-giving countries avoided any specific new commitment to finance the plan and stressed that the five Central American countries -Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica - cannot hope to resolve their refugee crisis until their governments make peace with rebel groups and show greater respect for human rights. **********The donor countries also urged the five governments to cooperate more closely with church groups and relief agencies, which have been quick to report human rights violations. **********Diplomats said the aid donors' stand, taken today at a United Nations conference on Central American refugees here, reflected frustration at the failure of Central American governments to carry out the commitments they made under the regional peace plan formulated in 1987 by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica.

But the real motive, evident to many if not most in the crowd, was to draw attention to and galvanize the still shaky coalition as leaders of opposition parties sense they may be able to win the next election if they can bury their differences long enough to agree on common candidates. **********The sense of common effort harks back to the end of the 1970's, when a similarly disparate and fractious group of politicians forged the Janata coalition that defeated Mr. Gandhi's mother, the late Indira Gandhi, before capsizing three years later when Mrs. Gandhi returned to power. **********Estimates of the crowd ranged from 300,000 to 500,000. Most of them were rural people brought in by bus and truck from surrounding states to enjoy a day in town in return for their cheers. As India heads toward a national campaign, the opposition is putting great stock in large demonstrations, since Government-controlled television cannot be used to present its case. Displaying the 'Vote Bank' **********The ability to field a crowd by whatever means is, in Indian democracy, a demonstration of the implied ability to get out votes, also by any means. Mr. Lal used today's good-natured celebration to display his formidable ''vote bank,'' a term used in Indian politics to connote something between a constituency and a claque. **********The Chief Minister, a champion of farmers who believe they are being left behind by urbanization, hopes to play a major role in framing the next government if Prime Minister Gandhi is defeated. In his speech today, he said he was writing off loans of poor farmers in his state, a policy the opposition has pledged to pursue nationally. **********Opposition leaders were permitted to stage their rally on the Boat Club lawns, a public park along the Rajpath boulevard in the shadow of the highest offices of government. It was one of the largest gatherings here in years. **********The rally coincided with a slide in the political fortunes of Mr. Gandhi, who has been on the defensive in recent weeks after questions of official bribery in a 1986 weapons purchase have again been raised. Mr. Gandhi is now expected to call an election in late December or early January. He is required to give only 45 days' notice. **********The presence on the platform of Atal Behari Vajpayee, a former Foreign Minister who heads a growing Hindu-based organization, the Bharatiya Janata Party, was considered significant. Mr. Gandhi's support in the Hindu-dominated north-central states will be crucial to him in the voting, as the south and parts of the northeast have clearly been drifting toward the opposition in recent state elections. **********But cooperation with the Hindu party is a gamble for the National Front, the core coalition of the opposition.

Gorbachev declared today that the Soviet Union has no moral or political right to interfere in the affairs of its East European neighbors, and held up neutral Finland as a model of stability in stormy Europe. **********His spokesman embroidered the theme jokingly, saying that Moscow had adopted ''the Sinatra doctrine'' in Eastern Europe. ''You know the Frank Sinatra song, 'I Did It My Way?' '' said Gennadi I. Gerasimov to reporters. ''Hungary and Poland are doing it their way.'' **********''I think the Brezhnev doctrine is dead,'' he added, using the Western term for the previous Soviet policy of armed intervention to prevent changes in the Communist governments of the Warsaw Pact, In talks with Finland's President, Mauno Koivisto, at the beginning of a three-day state visit, Mr. Gorbachev was reported to have said that the current political upheavals in the East bloc must be allowed to run their course. Of Regional Interest **********Mr. Gorbachev has repeatedly pledged a policy of noninterference, but his emphasis on the point - and his lauding of the Finnish example - were striking in a week when Hungary was joining Poland in a retreat from orthodox Communist rule, and East Germany was boiling with demands for political liberty. **********''The events that are now taking place in the countries of Eastern Europe concern the countries and people of that region,'' the Soviet leader told the Finnish President, according to Mr. Gerasimov, whose formal position is that of spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry. ''We have no right, moral or political right, to interfere in events happening there. We assume others will not interfere either.'' **********Finland, once an autonomous part of czarist Russia, gained its independence in 1917. It was invaded by the Soviet Union late in 1939, after the formal outbreak of World War II, and was forced to cede some territory to the Russians. The Karelian Autonomous Republic, which borders on Finland, is largely populated by Finnish-speakers. **********Today, as Mr. Gorbachev moved through largely friendly crowds, there were some cries of ''Give us back Karelia,'' but no indication that he heard them. **********Mr. Gerasimov, who served for many years as a correspondent for the Soviet news-feature agency Novosti in New York, has used the ''Sinatra doctrine'' expression before to explain the willingness of the Soviet Union to allow its allies to follow different political lines. A Deft Response **********Mr. Gerasimov declined a direct answer when asked how Moscow would respond if its allies wanted to move toward neutrality. He noted that Hungary and Poland still have obligations as members of military and economic alliances with the Soviet Union. **********''We may witness a change of government in Warsaw or Budapest, but international obligations do not necessarily go away with a change of government,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. **********He added that Moscow has long proposed a mutual breakup of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, but he did not say how the Kremlin would react if the Warsaw Pact showed signs of breaking up on its own. **********Still, Mr. Gorbachev's remarks today seemed to suggest that Moscow is open to more fundamental changes in its relations with East bloc allies. **********Both Poland and Hungary have said they do not plan to leave the alliance, but some officials in both countries favor drastic military changes, including withdrawal of Soviet forces now based on their soil. **********In recent months, Finland - with a largely free-market economy but reliant on Soviet trade, formally neutral but always attentive to Soviet security concerns - has loomed large in the minds of East bloc countries. Hungary has sent several delegations to study Finland's economy, its laws and its relations with Moscow. **********Asked during a brief walk in downtown Helsinki this evening whether he considered Finland a model for countries in Eastern Europe, Mr. Gorbachev replied, ''To me, Finland is a model of relations between a big country and a small country, a model of relations between states with different social systems, a model of relations between neighbors.'' **********As if to underscore the advantages of good-neighborly relations, Soviet officials this week are to sign an agreement to sharply reduce sulfur emissions that have been poisoning Finland's forests. **********Kaj Barlund, the Finnish Minister of the Environment, said in an interview today that it was ''the most radical'' anti-pollution agreement ever signed between a Communist and a non-Communist country, but he conceded that the Soviets would probably require costly technological help from the Finns to live up to their end of the deal. **********The treaty calls for reducing the two countries' 1.4 million tons a year of sulfur-dioxide emissions by half before 1995. The largest share of the noxious emissions comes from two Soviet nickel smelters a few miles east of the Finnish border. **********Mr. Gorbachev also made a significant concession to Finland's pride tonight when he said at a banquet speech, ''I want to greet neutral Finland.'' **********It was the first time that a Soviet leader had given full weight to this country's policy of neutrality in world politics. Moscow's reluctance to directly acknowledge that Finland is neutral has long been resented here as an implication that Finland owes special deference to the Kremlin. A Finely Tuned Ear **********In turn, Mr. Koivisto, the Finnish President, demonstrated the kind of sensitivity to the Soviet Union that the Kremlin prizes in this relationship. He included in his banquet speech an implicit but unmistakable message of non-support for separatist movements in Soviet Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, across the Baltic Sea from Finland. **********Mr. Koivisto said that although tensions are now erupting in the Soviet Union, ''underneath the surface, there is every reason for confidence in the ability of this community of peoples to solve its problems in a way that enables the distinctiveness of the parts to be increased while strengthening the whole.'' **********Finland and Estonia, which face each other across the Gulf of Finland, have longstanding ties that are now expanding. Direct air connections and a new, second ferry line across the gulf are due to open this winter, adding to an already fast-growing business and tourist traffic. Finnish bankers and businessmen say they see promising investment opportunities if Estonia gets greater economic independence from Moscow.  Russian Praises Baker **********MOSCOW, Oct. 25 (Reuters) - The Soviet Union today welcomed what it said was a new American approach to security relations outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and said Washington's view was close to its own. **********A Foreign ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliyev, said that recent speeches by Mr. Baker in New York and San Francisco ''clearly demonstrate a new U.S. approach to relations with the Soviet Union.'' **********After a wait-and-see attitude in Washington during the Bush Administration's early months, the Secretary of State said that American interests lay in the success of Mr. Gorbachev's program of political and economic change. **********''The stated principle of stability and predictability in strategic relations completely coincides with our own views,'' Mr. Perfiliyev said, alluding to Secretary Baker's speeches. **********But Mr. Perfiliyev also said that his Government could not accept all of Mr. Baker's propositions without qualification.

Both versions were immediately challenged by Nicaraguan diplomats involved in the incident. **********The Nicaraguan Ambassador to Panama, Antenor Ferrey, rejected American suggestions that the invasion of his residence had been an inadvertent ''screw-up,'' as President Bush called it in Texas. The Ambassador described the action as ''a deliberate and open provocation'' in violation of diplomatic norms and said American officials were lying about key detils of the confrontation. **********In separate briefings for reporters this morning, officials of the United States Embassy and the United States Southern Command differed on whether shots had been fired in the incident, on the number of people in the residence and on whether there was diplomatic identification on the residence. They also differed on whether Nicaragua was due a formal apology and on the sequence of events concerning the arrival of Mr. Ferrey at ''what is now claimed to be the alleged home of the Nicaraguan Ambassador,'' as the Southern Command put it. Confusion Over Address **********The Southern Command said its troops fired warning shots, found seven people in the house and had their entry impeded by Mr. Ferrey. The embassy said it was unaware that shots had been fired, reported 10 or more people in the residence and said Mr. Ferrey ''was not at the house when the incident happened.'' **********A senior embassy official professed to be unaware of the Southern Command's detailed account of the incident. When reporters pointed out contradictions between the account he said he had been given by the military and the offiicial military statement, he said he was hearing of them for the first time. **********In its statement this morning, the Southern Command suggested that much of the confusion had arisen because information it had been given by the American Embassy here listed an address that was not Mr. Ferrey's as the official residence of the Nicaraguan Ambassador. That address later turned out to be the residence of Mr. Ferrey's predecessor, who left here nearly a year ago. **********Based on ''this information that the house was not covered by diplomatic immunity, the commander on the scene informed Mr. Ferrey that he had received authorization to search the house and intended to do so,'' said Col. Ronald Sconyers, a Southern Command spokesman. **********A Latin American diplomat said all embassies here are routinely notified by the Panamanian Foreign Ministry any time an ambassador moves. He said that for the United States Embassy not to have known the residence of diplomats of a nation whose activities it considers a security threat ''was an incredible and inexplicable lapse.'' Incidents 'Inevitable' **********The senior American Embassy official admitted that American diplomats were not initially advised of the imbroglio. But he said he did not think it unusual that military officers on the scene did not seek clarification from diplomats more familiar with Panama. **********''When you have a lot of troops, you're always going to have incidents of confusion,'' he said. ''That's inevitable.'' **********The American Embassy is ''generally aware'' of the activities of American troops here and sets general policy guidelines for them, he continued. ''But there are a lot of military'' and relatively few diplomats, he said, which makes it difficult to stay abreast of individual cases. 'It Was a Mistake' **********American Embassy and military officials characterized the raid as consistent with a policy of searching out arms, usually with the help of Panamanian informants. The raid originated, the senior American Embassy official said, with a report of a house ''where there were a lot of arms, and, they thought, Nicaraguans.'' **********The American diplomats said the raid was not a deliberate action intended to send a message to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or to the Vatican mission, where the deposed military leader took refuge on Christmas Eve. He said The United States continued to accept the rules of the Vienna Convention governing the sanctity of diplomatic chanceries and residences. **********''It was a mistake,'' the diplomat said of the raid. ''We do not go into diplomatic residences.'' **********Military officials, however, said no apology was owed Nicaragua. Colonel Sconyers said American forces did not ''make a mistake.'' ''We did exactly what we should have done,'' he said, ''but we decided it was prudent to return the weapons.'' **********He also said the residence may have been identified as part of the Nicaraguan Embassy by ''a small placard on the building, but that of course is insufficient evidence to assure diplomatic immunitgy.'' The embassy officials, however, said the confrontation had developed because Mr. Ferrey's house ''bore no outward identification of any sort that it was a diplomatic facility.'' ''It looked like any other house.'' Mr. Ferrey disputed that version of events, saying that the official shield identifying the house as a diplomatic residence went up not long after his arrival here on April 3. The plastic emblem was clearly visible in a window of the house this afternoon, measuring about two feet in circumference and reading ''Republic of Nicaragua, Central America, Embassy.'' Shield There 'for Months' **********A Panamanian woman who lives across the street from the Nicaraguan Embassy residence corroborated Mr. Ferrey's statement. ''That shield has been there for months,'' the woman, Cecilia Chang, said. **********Mr. Ferrey said that in any case his residence was well known to American forces. ''They've been sending patrols around here on a regular basis ever since the invasion began,'' he said. **********The Nicaraguan Ambassador also said that he had arrived at his home in a vehicle with diplomatic plates, immediately identified the house as his residence, and produced the credentials the Panamanian Government supplies to all diplomats here. He said his arguments, relayed to an American colonel in charge of the operation through a translator, were simply ignored. **********''I told them they would regret what they were doing because this was Nicaraguan territory,'' he said. ''They said they had their orders to go in, willingly or unwillingly.'' **********Mr. Ferrey said that he then scuffled with American soldiers as they entered the house and at one point ''fell to the ground with an officer.'' He said that people inside the house had been given orders to open fire on the American troops if the soldiers had begun shooting at the embassy residence. Items Reported Missing **********Inside the residence today, family members were cleaning up and trying to make a list of damaged or missing goods. In a room off the main hallway, two telephones had been ripped from the wall and files and a cabinet rifled. **********Alvaro Ferrey, brother of the Ambassador who also lives in the house, said $3,000 in cash was discovered missing after the American soldiers left the house. The watch of a maid was also said to have disappeared during a one-and-a-half-hour search of the residence by what the Nicaraguans said were more than 30 armed soldiers. **********The Southern Command said the search of the house had uncovered seven grenades and a dozen AK-47's, as well as pistols, Uzi machine guns, antitank weapons, shotguns, bayonets, machetes and a large stock of ammunition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/03/world/pact-in-nicaragua-us-resists-too.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 984, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pact in Nicaragua: U.S. Resists Too", "print_headline": "Pact in Nicaragua: U.S. Resists Too", "body_text": " **********Although the United States has vehemently denounced President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua for ending a cease-fire and violating regional peace accords, the United States itself has resisted key provisions of those accords. **********A regional peace plan adopted in August obliges Nicaragua to hold free, fair elections by February and calls for the voluntary disbanding of contra camps in Honduras by early December of this year. Well before the regional peace accord was signed in Tela, Honduras, by five Central American presidents, Nicaragua and the contras agreed to a cease-fire in negotiations in Sapoa, Nicaragua. **********The truce took effect April 1, 1988, and was to last 60 days. It was extended, usually a month at a time, by the Nicaraguan Government until Mr. Oretga ended the cease-fire on Wednesday. **********But from the start, the United States had trouble with the agreement signed in August. Washington was not a party to the regional peace plan and has made known its opposition to the early disbanding of the contras. Because of the heavy American influence on Honduras, which relies on the United States for protection against Nicaragua and for economic and military aid, the Hondurans have steadily resisted demands from Nicaragua that they force the contras to disband if they do not do so voluntarily. **********The wording of the Tela agreement was ambiguous enough to allow the Hondurans to take that stand, since the accord did not explicitly oblige the Hondurans to force the contras to break up. Rather, there was a call for a special commission drawn from the United Nations and the Organization of American States to organize the voluntary disbanding. But that commission has not succeeded yet in persuading the contras to leave Honduras. **********The Americans have argued that the contras should stay intact to put pressure on the Sandinistas to hold free and fair elections in February. **********If the rebel forces were disbanded before February, Washington has argued, there would be no leverage on the Sandinistas to permit free elections. That argument has generally been persuasive with many members of Congress, who have hoped that elections in Nicaragua would lead to a more open society and removal of that issue from American politics. **********The United States, according to Administration officials, has supplied cash to the contras inside Nicaragua at a rate of $150,000 to $200,000 a month. The United States Agency for International Development, which runs the program, says the money - $759,084 from May through August - is intended for food and other ''essential goods.'' 'They Will Infiltrate Nicaragua' **********Administration officials also said they were aware that large numbers of guerrillas were going back into Nicaragua with their weapons in the last few weeks. Richard A. Boucher, the deputy spokesman at the State Department, said 2,000 guerrillas had crossed into northern Nicaragua from Honduras to rejoin 3,500 fighters who have been there on the ''northern front'' for 18 months. **********President Ortega says that some of those returning contras have tried to disrupt the election campaign, even though the United States says it urged the rebels to refrain from offensive military operations. To American officials, it was no surprise that some of the contras went back to Nicaragua with their guns; that is exactly what they had said they would do. **********In an interview on Aug. 2, Ernesto Palazio, a spokesman for the contras, said: ''They will stay intact until they see the results of the elections. They will infiltrate Nicaragua, going in clandestinely. They will relocate, but not demobilize.'' **********State Department officials and Republican members of Congress said today that the Nicaraguan Army had been relentless in conducting search-and-destroy missions against the contras and had violated the cease-fire much more than the rebels had. Washington's Role Criticized **********Mr. Boucher said that Sandinista troops, using artillery and attack helicopters, launched ''large scale'' operations against contras today in two regions of Nicaragua. **********Nearly everyone in Congress criticizes Mr. Ortega, but some say they believe the United States could have done more to prevent the resumption of fighting. **********Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said in an interview: ''The United States should definitely have discouraged the contras from infiltrating into Nicaragua. Instead, the U.S. turned a blind eye and allowed the contras to carry out hostile acts that they hoped would provoke Ortega to do something intemperate. Our Government has done nothing to stop the contras' attacks on farm cooperatives and Sandinista reservists.'' **********By a vote of 379 to 29, the House of Representatives today approved a resolution that condemns Mr. Ortega for ending the cease-fire. The Senate unanimously approved the measure on Tuesday. Question of U.S. Aide **********The White House said today that it was unrealistic to expect the contras to lay down their arms when the Nicaraguan Government was out ''to destroy them.'' **********''You can't ask people to repatriate themselves into a climate where they're threatened with death,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. ''It's very hard for them to consider demobilization when they're being wiped out by offensive forces from the Sandinistas.'' **********Mr. Fitzwater said the White House was not even counting votes in Congress to see if there would be support for a resumption of American arms shipments to the contras. The chief question on Capitol Hill is whether the United States should continue sending food, clothing and medical supplies. With more than a trace of bitterness, Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the contras, said, ''This whole debate is about whether the contras should be killed with their stomachs full or their stomachs empty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/world/an-indian-city-begins-to-suffer-from-success.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1989-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Indian City Begins to Suffer From Success", "print_headline": "An Indian City Begins to Suffer From Success", "body_text": " **********Almost everything about Bangalore, the country's fifth-largest and fastest-growing city, makes it different from the rest of India. **********The people of this genteel place like to think they have realized the elusive dream of a modern India where life is sweet and most things work.

It can be solved by refining a national aviation policy with the input of groups that use the system. **********In fact, $10 billion for such action is already available in the Aviation Trust Fund created by user taxes on general aviation products and airline tickets. If appropriated by Congress, these funds would go a long way to provide the equipment, manpower and airport facilities to make a national aviation policy work for everyone on an equitable basis.

Prices set contract highs before closing with a sharp decline. **********Heating oil prices, which have propelled the advance in the crude oil market, continued to rise and set contract highs. **********At the close of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading market for energy futures, the expired spot January crude oil contract was settled at $22.33 a barrel, up 11 cents on the day, after setting a life-of-contract high at $22.95. The low of $15.49 was posted on Feb. 14. The new spot crude oil contract, for February, settled at $21.28, down 15 cents. **********The spot January contract for heating oil, which expires Dec. 28, rose a further 0.35 cent a gallon, to 75.01 cents, after setting a life-of-contract high at 75.80 cents. The spot unleaded gasoline contract, which also expires Dec. 28, posted a seasonal decline of 0.58 cent a gallon, at 53.93 cents. 'Would Have Expected Problems' **********''Despite the volatile trading and wild 5- and 10-cent price moves we saw, the spot crude delivery went off the board in a fairly orderly manner without a squeeze developing,'' said Bradford H. Hughes, energy analyst at Cargill Investor Services. ''Given the unusually large number of open contracts in the spot month on the morning of expiration day, one would have expected problems.'' **********Apparently those who had sold January crude oil short had the oil to deliver, or bought out of their positions, without having to pay a steep premium. In a classic squeeze on the futures market, those who have sold a commodity short and cannot deliver it on expiration day are forced to pay dearly to buy out of their contract. **********Peter C. Beutel, energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said, ''There is no shortage of crude oil - quite the opposite.'' **********He continued: ''Part of the current problem can be traced to the unusually mild winter of 1987-88. That caught many refiners and distributors of heating oil with large inventories, much it carried at relatively high financing costs. They were determined not to be caught again. Thus, the unseasonably cold weather this fall in the Northeast caught them with relatively short supplies of heating oil.'' **********Demand for heating oil has pushed up crude prices in Europe as well as in the United States. Prices of North Sea Brent blends, similar to the high-quality West Texas Intermediate grades traded in the United States, have soared. The nearest Brent delivery, for February, traded earlier in the day in London at $19.54 a barrel.

Mr. Pope persuaded bank lenders to allow a reopening of some of the terms of the financing if United should find itself in a severe recession like the one that hit the industry in 1980 and 1981, the source said. **********Also, the source said, the pilots' union would reopen parts of its seven-year contract under certain conditions, if the bid was approved. **********On the other hand, the source said, if the airline does well and is able to repay debt much faster than expected, then some of the cuts in wages and benefits might be shortened or modified. Some Possible Advantages **********The airline could end up with an operating cost advantage over other airlines. The pilots, under a new contract, would take 10 percent cuts in pay. Also, rather than being paid for some hours worked, the pilots would get credit toward company stock. **********The union would also be committed to a seven-year contract. It would not strike during that period and its members would be obliged to cross any picket lines put up by other unions. **********The other major union at United. the International Assocication of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, remains unwilling to participate in the offer.

In papers filed in Federal court in Manhattan, they referred to records of Mr. Boesky's bank accounts and other information obtained through depositions. **********Mr. Boesky's lawyers monitored his bank accounts and either knew or should have known that he had at least $125 million assets in the fall of 1986, before the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the court papers said. **********And the lawyers knew that he controlled at least $5 million in liquid assets and a total of at least $25 million after he settled the insider charges, the papers said. Almost No Money **********More than a year later, when Mr. Boesky was sentenced on related criminal charges, his lawyer, Leon Silverman, repeatedly told the sentencing judge, Morris E. Lasker, that his client was on the verge of bankruptcy. At around the same time, Mr. Boesky filed a net worth statement with the Government that said he had almost no money. **********The court filing raises questions about Mr. Boesky's current resources. **********Mr. Silverman of the firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson declined yesterday to comment on the case.

''If that turns out to be false, he has a great number of things to respond to.'' The firm continues to represent Mr. Boesky. **********Since the settlement of the civil charges were announced in 1986, S.E.C. officials have discounted repeated criticism by lawmakers that the settlement was too lenient. **********Mr. Boesky's personal finances at the time of the 1986 settlement were listed in detail yesterday in amendments to a civil suit in 1987 by investors in defunct Boesky partnerships against him, his lawyers and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********The amendments were filed by George D.

In 1987 he pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false statements with the S.E.C. about a stock transaction. **********After he announced that he would settle the civil charges and plead guilty to a felony, Mr. Boesky's salary from one of his investing enterprises was raised to $250,000, from $35,000, the papers state. The increase was given at the direction of another Fried, Frank partner, Herbert Minkel. **********''I have no recollection of Ivan's compensation being increased,'' Mr. Minkel said.

He is on the verge of bankruptcy. His life is now doomed. He faces bankruptcy.'' **********Similar statements were made by Mr. Silverman a few weeks later, when Mr. Boesky was sentenced. Bank Accounts Monitored **********The court papers state that Mr. Boesky's bank accounts were monitored in 1986 by Frederick Lubcher, of Fried, Frank. On Nov. 11, the same week that Mr. Boesky announced that he would pay $100 million to settle insider charges, Mr. Lubcher received Mr. Boesky's personal financial files.

It holds 60 percent of the market for noncorrosive fiberglass-constructed tanks. **********Some analysts think that demand for the company's tanks will grow at a 15 to 20 percent annual rate, assuming that one third of the 1.6 million unprotected tanks will be replaced rather than upgraded.

Michel Aoun, the Prime Minister of the Christian admijistration, and obtained promises to cooperate, officials at the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said today. **********Arab nations offered help after efforts to bridge the divisions failed. Parliament, which served as one of the institutions of central government during 13 years of intermittent civil strife, has been unable to meet. A conflict between its Muslim and Christian members prevented it from electing a new head of state to replace President Amin Gemayel. **********There is doubt here that the Arab effort will produce results. Arab involvement in Lebanon is as old as the civil war itself; 40,000 Syrian troops were sent to Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to end the national strife.

The management of Eastern, a subsidiary of the Texas Air Corporation, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on March 9 and has been hiring and training replacements for members of all three unions since then. **********In a separate development, a spokeswoman for American Airlines said yesterday that negotiations for the purchase of Eastern's Latin American routes were ''at a standstill.'' Mary K. O'Neill, the spokeswoman, said American had been holding occasional talks with Eastern since the bankruptcy filing. **********''We're not clear what it is they want to sell us,'' she said. **********American, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, has applied to the Transportation Department for permission to fly to South America, she added. Airline executives have said Eastern wanted about $375 million for its routes. **********Eastern has made no decision on whether to sell the routes, said Karen M.

The board consists of the leaders of the pilots' union units at the 46 airlines the union represents. **********The Eastern pilots were also unsuccessful in persuading the executive board to transfer their seniority at Eastern automatically to other airlines that hire them. Under existing union rules, pilots may keep their seniority - and corresponding pay and choice of when to fly - only when they change airlines during a sale or lease of assets. **********The Eastern pilots have formally discussed the seniority issue with pilots at Pan Am and informally with pilots at Midway Airlines, following the recent leases and purchases of Eastern aircraft and airport gates by those two airlines, said Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Eastern pilots. **********J.

''The temperature and the tension are heating up. I don't think the army wants to shoot again, but the threat does more than hang in the air.'' **********Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's leading opposition figure and leader of the National League for Democracy, is drawing between 10,000 and 15,000 people to political rallies, a clear contravention of a martial law regulation limiting such meetings to fewer than five people. The gatherings are the largest and most disciplined since the Burmese Army shot down demonstrators in August and September, killing at least 3,000 unarmed civilians, and diplomats say they are getting larger. **********''We don't have any intention to seek a confrontation,'' Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said in a telephone interview. ''We intend to carry on peacefully with our rallies. We do not want any trouble.'' 'Slack in the Rope' **********She said that since soliders shot a man and she was temporarily detained at a rally two weeks ago, the military had kept armed men away from her rallies. That is encouraging, she said, but some diplomats said the ''slack in the rope'' could also be ominous. **********''They would love to declare the N.L.D. an illegal organization,'' Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said. ''They're looking for pretexts.'' **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of the man considered the country's founding father, U Aung San, has called for mass gatherings on Wednesday, Martyr's Day, which commemorates the assassination of her father and six Cabinet colleagues in 1947, just before independence. The military Government, led by Gen. Saw Maung, plans its own commemorations. **********On Sunday, the Government warned that it ''would not permit political exploitation of the ceremony,'' according to the official radio. ''Action will be taken against disruption of the ceremony by way of procession, slogan chanting, incitement and forcible mobilization of people,'' the radio said. **********Four days later is the anniversary of the resignation speech last year of U Ne Win, the country's ruler since a 1962 coup. While he now keeps to the background, diplomats and ordinary Burmese believe that General Ne Win still controls the Government; General Saw Maung admits to relying on him for counsel. **********Other anniversaries come thick and fast: On Aug. 5 last year, 30 demonstrators were shot in Pegu; on Aug. 8, at least 1,000 were killed in the capital; on Aug. 10, demonstrators were shot in front of the capital's general hospital. The calendar of violence to be commemorated continues through Sept. 18, when the military formally took over the Government and at least 2,000 more civilians were shot down by the army over two days, according to estimates by diplomats. No Correspondents' Visa **********Apparently as part of its own preparations for a difficult summer, the Government last week suspended the issuing of visas to foreign correspondents. It began giving such visas only in February. **********Diplomats point to other recent signs of tension, including two bomb explosions. One a week ago in the lobby of City Hall killed three people and wounded four, and one the previous Friday in the important oil refinery town of Syriam, nine miles outside Yangon, killed the son of the refinery director and at least one other person. **********Diplomats say the explosions could be terrorism or a pretext by the military to justify another crackdown. **********Today, in announcing the arrest of three young members of the National League for Democracy in the refinery bombing, the Burmese intelligence chief, Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt, said, ''Now it is obvious who is behind the recent bombing and plans to disrupt law and order,'' The Associated Press reported from Yangon. **********Apparently referring to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the general said a party leader had made ''insinuations that the military was after her life,'' adding, ''We are worried that she might fall and hurt her toe even, because we will be blamed for any harm to her.'' **********The diplomats also cite a long speech by General Saw Maung warning of the dangers of ''confrontation,'' citing the National League for Democracy and saying martial law would be enforced. He also said the military Government, in the name of neutrality, would not engage in any talks with the political parties, in effect rejecting Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's calls for dialogue. Food Prices Soaring **********Along with these signs of tension, food prices are soaring. The price of rice, regarded as a reasonable barometer of trouble ahead, has risen to its highest level in anyone's memory. The cost of cooking oil, eggs, meat and gasoline is also high and rising. **********''The price of rice worries me a lot,'' a diplomat said. ''The demonstrations last year were fueled as much by frustration with economic disaster as by any desire for democracy.'' **********The Government has also continued to arrest student leaders and political workers involved with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and other political parties. A spokesman for the National League for Democracy said that at least 2,000 members have been arrested since last September."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/business/data-bank-dec-17-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA BANK: Dec. 17, 1989", "print_headline": "DATA BANK: Dec. 17, 1989", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/20/business/finance-new-issues-jersey-unit-offers-tax-exempt-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jersey Unit Offers Tax-Exempt Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Jersey Unit Offers Tax-Exempt Issue", "body_text": " **********The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency is offering $80 million of tax-exempt home buyer revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 7.90 percent for an issue due 2022 through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Yields for serial bonds range from 7.20 percent in 1993 to 7.50 percent in 1999 and 7.70 percent in 2004.

The first test comes this month as Texas Air, Eastern's corporate parent, tries to convince Eastern's creditors that it can protect their interests better than any of the half-dozen prospective buyers courted by labor. **********That may not prove as difficult as the unions argue. A strong market should allow Eastern to realize a mountain of cash from the sale of aircraft and gates not needed to run a downsized airline. And airport congestion might well prevent competitors from muscling in on Eastern's core business, giving it time to polish its tarnished image. **********Texas Air's decision to take down the ''for sale'' sign at Eastern after the 11th-hour collapse of the Ueberroth deal was greeted with a mixture of suspicion and surprise. If Eastern was as close to death as conventional wisdom suggested, the best Mr. Lorenzo could do was to sell it before rigor mortis set in. **********But Bob McAdoo of Oppenheimer & Company, who has worked for both Texas Air and one of its rivals, believes the decision to go it alone made economic sense. Frank Lorenzo, he argues, can rebuild Eastern as an upscale carrier - one big enough to benefit from Texas Air's marketing power, but small enough to duck head-on competition with industry giants. **********Under the proposed reorganization plan, Eastern would sell gates and landing rights at some airports, along with a third of its airplanes and all of its Latin American routes. Half of the $1.8 billion in proceeds would go to pay off debt, leaving a war chest of about $800 million. That should be more than enough cash, Mr. McAdoo says, to cover Eastern's start-up as a Piedmont-sized, Atlanta-based carrier catering to business travelers. **********Eastern would, in fact, emerge from the cocoon with major advantages over other airline start-ups. It would still be a partner in Texas Air's OnePass program, giving hundreds of thousands of Eastern, Trump Shuttle and Continental frequent fliers an incentive to try the new carrier. And it would remain linked to Texas Air's System One computer reservation service, giving it a marketing edge with thousands of travel agents. **********The old Eastern lost $1.5 billion in the last nine years. Why would ''New Eastern'' do any better? **********The obvious reason is labor costs. Eastern would be able to replace thousands of ramp attendants at half the current $15-an-hour union wage. More important, it would start with a clean slate on labor relations, ending a decade of confrontation that lowered productivity and tarnished Eastern's image with travelers. **********The not so obvious reason is competition. The old Eastern was forced to shave fares, and service, in search of cost-conscious vacationers. New Eastern would abandon its most competitive, lowest-yield routes through New York and Miami for the more hospitable business climate in Atlanta. **********The revamped carrier would have to share many routes as well as the Atlanta hub with Delta, which has earned the loyalty of business travelers. But unlike United or American, Delta lacks the killer instinct: Mr. McAdoo believes that Delta would not risk a price war to try to drive cash-rich Eastern from its markets. Competitors more inclined to serve as Eastern's executioner would not be able to purchase enough gates at the crowded Atlanta terminal. **********Until very recently it was widely believed that Eastern could never find 1,700 experienced pilots needed to replace striking union members. But Eastern says that it has already hired 200 pilots on top of the 230 who crossed the picket line. And it has applications from another 1,400 with qualifications that far exceed Eastern's established standards. **********By Mr. McAdoo's reckoning, it should not be difficult to convince creditors that a relatively small, nonunion carrier with lots of cash, a relatively light debt load and marketing help from Texas Air has a better chance of succeeding than a highly leveraged Eastern committed to keeping all its union employees on the payroll. **********But New Eastern is not a guaranteed winner: a deep recession, or a union campaign impugning the airline's safety might prove its undoing. Thus Mr. Lorenzo's toughest task may be to convince creditors that Eastern is worth more as an airline than as a portfolio of salable assets. **********Indeed, Mr. Lorenzo may face an ironic embarrassment of riches: With used planes selling at premium prices and East Coast airport facilities in scarce supply, he may ultimately have a hard time convincing his own board that Eastern is worth more in the air than in the bank."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/business/brazil-seeks-extension-for-getting-money.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1989-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil Seeks Extension for Getting Money", "print_headline": "Brazil Seeks Extension for Getting Money", "body_text": " **********Brazilian negotiators asked commercial bankers yesterday to allow Brazil more time to qualify for a $600 million payment from the banks that was scheduled to be made this month, bankers said. **********The Brazilian request comes as the country apparently heads toward missing a September deadline for a $1.6 billion interest payment on outstanding commercial loans.

According to the association, 1988 was the best year for machine tool orders since 1980. **********''While year-to-date metal forming orders remain level with 1988, metal-cutting orders have fallen - largely due to a drop in automotive orders,'' said Albert W. Moore, president of the association. **********But he added, ''Industry analysts have predicted another upturn in automotive machine tool purchases in the second half of 1990, as some of the uncertainties over fuel economy and clean-air requirements become settled.''

For the year to date, shipments rose to $2.5 billion, up 35.1 percent from $1.85 billion in the comparable period in 1988, largely because of the rise in orders placed last year by domestic and foreign manufacturers. It typically takes six to nine months to deliver machine tools after they are ordered. **********The report also stated that export shipments were up 37.8 percent for the year, while export orders were down 27.1 percent as foreign demand for American tools continues to ease. **********Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were down 24.7 percent in October, to $144.9 million, compared with September's $192.5 million.

The callers said they represented ''The Extraditables,'' who are believed to be the drug cartel figures wanted for extradition to the United States. **********The attack occurred as the first of $65 million worth of military equipment and other American aid was leaving the United States.

Paper Opposes Traffickers **********The newspaper, the nation's second largest, has refused to yield in its condemnation of drug traffickers even after the assassination of its publisher, Guillermo Cano, two and a half years ago, and repeated death threats against the staff. **********The explosion stunned the already tense capital. In the last week the drug traffickers unleashed a series of bomb and rocket attacks in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city and the center of its narcotics trade. **********Until now there had been one bombing in Bogota, which shattered the offices of a travel agency last week but did not injure anyone. In nearly 20 explosions in Medellin, two people have been killed and a dozen wounded, leading the mayor to impose a 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. nightly curfew. **********Since shortly after President Virgilio Barco Vargas declared war on the drug traffickers on Aug. 18, hours after the assassination of Colombia's leading presidential candidate, the traffickers have seized the initiative. **********Their objective, stated in anonymous telephone calls to radio stations and letters published in newspapers, is to force the Government to enter peace negotiations and to abandon its plans to extradite traffickers wanted for narcotics crimes in the United States. **********President Barco's Government has refused to negotiate, and officials say they are moving to extradite Eduardo Martinez Romero, an economist linked to the Medellin cocaine cartel who has been indicted in Atlanta on charges of money laundering.

In the last several years, they have murdered dozens of journalists and scores of judges. **********The traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited to the United States. **********Immediately after the explosion, the police began putting up roadblocks throughout the capital, stopping and searching all vehicles, but by early afternoon they had made no arrests. **********In the first few days of the Government campaign, the police and army arrested more than 11,000 people in more than 2,000 separate raids against drug traffickers. **********But none of the leaders of the nation's drug cartels were captured, and more than 70 percent of those who were taken into custody have been released for lack of evidence, the police said. **********The police said the bomb this morning had been made with 130 to 220 pounds of dynamite and had been detonated with a timing device. **********''The idea was to blow up the gas station with thousands of gallons of fuel and this way destroy El Espectador,'' one police official said.

But Mr. Salinas's economic team is trying to use the accord to generate the confidence that would encourage the private sector, both foreign and domestic, to make up expected shortfalls of billions of dollars in Mexico's resources. **********''The agreement is not exactly what the Government asked for, but it should be sufficient for the short-term objectives the Government has in mind,'' said Luis Pazos, a leading conservative economist here. ''It is not in itself a solution to the problem, and the President knows that. But his hope is that it will create expectations so positive that money now abroad will return, which would in turn have a more positive effect than the negotiation of the debt itself.'' Nestle's Big Investment **********There are already some signs of success from the effort. On Tuesday, the Nestle Company announced that it would invest $300 million in Mexico in the next three years, a decision that company officials said was taken in June with the expectation that economic conditions here would soon improve after seven years of debt-induced austerity and recession. **********''We, like other companies, have suffered the consequences of the economic crisis the country has lived through and the drop in purchasing power of the population,'' said Carlos Represas, president of the Nestle group here. ''But we feel Mexico has reached the end of the decade having carried out profound changes and structural transformations that open new perspectives of growth in the 1990's.'' **********Mr. Represas said the new money would be funneled into expanding production, introducing new product lines and increasing exports to the United States, Central America and the Caribbean. He added that he was ''sure more companies will follow suit'' and that Nestle's Mexican and foreign rivals here have ''accelerated their own plans to do so'' to remain competitive. 'This Wave Is Going to Grow' **********''Surfers say that when a wave is forming, it will pass you by unless your board is ready,'' he said. ''We think this wave is going to grow, and that's why we've made the decision to get aboard it.'' **********In what the Government is calling another demonstration of confidence in Mr. Salinas and the agreement, 11 European banks announced this week that they would lend $210 million to a Mexican copper company that was once owned by the Government but is now in private hands. New foreign commercial bank loans to private companies have been virtually frozen since the debt crisis erupted in the summer of 1982. **********Mexican stocks have also risen in the wake of the agreement, but the market is small and volatile. A more telling indication of the overall investor reaction has been the fall of interest rates on Mexican Treasury bonds. They have declined to 34 percent from 56 percent since the beginning of the month, with 12 points of that drop coming in Tuesday's auction. **********A drop in domestic interest rates is crucial to the success of Mr. Salinas's program, not only as a gauge of public confidence but also in concrete terms. Mexico's internal debt has grown to more than $50 billion, and drains three times as much from the economy each year as repayment of foreign debt obligations. Capital Outflows **********Nevertheless, one diplomat said, ''It takes more than a few swallows to make a spring.'' As much as $50 billion in capital is estimated to have fled the country since the economic crisis began, and continued doubts about the true benefits of the debt-reduction package could encourage Mexican investors to keep their money in banks and real estate in California and Texas. **********The new agreement permits banks to choose among three options: a 35 percent reduction on the value of existing loans, a 6.25 percent interest-rate cap on those loans or lending new money. As a result, several months are expected to pass before it is clear just how much debt reduction Mexico has actually achieved. In the meantime, Mr. Salinas has to begin preparing next year's budget, uncertain of what the cash-flow situation will be and with every move being watched by skeptics. **********''He's got some problems on the 1990 budget, since they need a minimal amount of new money,'' an American banker said. ''If everyone goes for debt reduction, then you have to worry about the deal blowing up or being cut back. The distribution is very important.'' Finance Minister's Estimate **********On July 17, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe said the new accord would immediately reduce Mexico's net annual outflow of capital to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product from the current level of 6.3 percent, a calculation that implies that the vast majority of bank creditors will grant debt reduction instead of new loans. Even so, Mr. Aspe's estimate of the effect of the relief was viewed by many here as too optimistic. **********''This agremeent is not the last word on this theme,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a Mexican economist and the head of a consulting firm whose clients include many large companies. ''In a year or two, Mexico will have to return and negotiate again. Two years ago, the banks rejected the principle of debt reduction, so who knows, in two years they may accept principles they will not accept today.'' **********By raising expectations in his speech announcing the agreement a week ago, Mr. Salinas has encouraged demands that could lead to a new surge of inflation. Already, the labor unions and peasant groups that are important constituencies of his Institutional Revolutionary Party are clamoring for increases in social spending. Modernization Program **********Government officials, however, said Mr. Salinas would continue to move ahead with the economic modernization program that won Mexico its model-debtor status. A liberalization is said to be in the works for the rules governing the booming maquiladora industry, which assembles components brought into Mexico duty-free and then exports them at a reduced tariff rate back to the United States. And the process of cutting Government spending and selling state companies is expected to continue. **********''To recover, we need confidence, and you gain confidence not only with a debt settlement but with good economic policies, good economic policies and more good economic policies,'' a senior Government official said. ''We are certainly not going to change our approach now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-in-the-east-walesa-s-view-of-glemp-irks-jewish-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Neil Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clamor in the East; Walesa's View of Glemp Irks Jewish Leaders", "print_headline": "Clamor in the East; Walesa's View of Glemp Irks Jewish Leaders", "body_text": " **********When Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, entered a midtown law office yesterday to meet with about 70 leaders of Jewish organizations, he was enthusiastically applauded.

But many of the Jewish leaders told him it was important to acknowledge what they said was a sad but undeniable history. **********''There was a great disposition to greet him in the warmest possible way, to treat him as a hero,'' said Philip Baum, the associate executive director of the American Jewish Congress. ''People were very much captivated by him, although many found some of his answers very unsatisfying.'' **********Seymour D. Reich, president of B'nai B'rith and the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, presented Mr. Walesa with an ancient vase from Israel as a gift. Mr. Walesa kissed the vase and declared his ''love of Israel and the Jewish people,'' Mr. Reich said. **********Mr. Reich said he was one of several who told Mr. Walesa that ''Polish anti-Semitism existed and it had to be acknowledged and it could not be hidden.'' He said that Mr. Walesa seemed to feel that such an emphasis ''could tarnish the mood for investment.'' **********Much of the discussion focused on the dispute over an agreement to move a convent from the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the position taken on the issue by Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland. **********Although the Vatican agreed in 1987 to move the Carmelite convent in deference to complaints from Jews, Cardinal Glemp resisted and eventually repudiated the agreement, complaining of what he said were shrill Jewish protests. **********Angered by Jews' insistence that the convent be moved in accordance with the agreement, Cardinal Glemp complained in August that national sovereignty and the ''feelings of all Poles'' were under attack from the Jewish community. In September, he relented and said the convent would be moved to an interfaith center to be built nearby. **********Mr. Baum said that Mr. Walesa described the August statement as unfortunate and badly formulated. **********Justin J. Finger, the associate national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said that Mr. Walesa said he regretted that Cardinal Glemp had made the remarks, but that he considered the reaction to the Cardinal's statement to be excessive. Mr. Finger quoted Mr. Walesa as saying that the Cardinal ''is my Primate and I listen to him in matters of religion, but not politics.'' Leaves Some 'Quite Cold' **********Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish Congress, said that Mr. Walesa's ''defense of Cardinal Glemp left the community quite cold.'' He said that many pointed out to Mr. Walesa that the Solidarity newspaper had been quick to criticize the Cardinal. **********''In view of that,'' Mr. Lifton said, ''I found it surprising he felt obliged not to say he disagreed with Glemp.'' **********Rabbi Henry D. Michelman, executive vice president of the Synagogue Council of America, said that Mr. Walesa ''spoke very directly about his abhorrence and rejection of anti-Semitism.'' Rabbi Michelman said that while he was slightly dismayed by some of Mr. Walesa's responses, he applauded his overall approach to Polish-Jewish relations. **********In a meeting yesterday with editors of The New York Times, Mr. Walesa said he was greatly troubled by the dispute over the Auschwitz site and that he was ''ashamed that they can fight over a thing like that.'' **********Mr. Walesa said he told the Jewish organization leaders that ''the Jewish community is the nation that has paid the highest price in the history of the world. And we, the Polish nation, have paid the second highest price. Are we supposed to fight among ourselves?'' **********Mr. Walesa said that ''Auschwitz belongs to the world.

The amount is about $70 billion at the official exchange rate of 1.85 marks to the dollar. **********Mr. Hofner said further that the efficiency of factories producing goods for export had sunk by almost 50 percent in the last nine years and that this would lead to further deficits, perhaps 65 billion marks - about $35 billion at the official rate - in the 1990's. As a small consolation, he told the Parliament that East Germany's counties, cities and villages were debt-free. **********The Finance Minister said he could not confirm an estimate by a member of Parliament that East Germany's inflation rate stood at 12 percent. But today a party economics expert said the rate was much higher than that. $20 Billion Foreign Debt Gerhard Schurer, the departing chairman of the State Planning Commission, told Parliament that East Germany's foreign debt was a state secret. But today Berliner Zeitung, the organ of the Berlin party, cited the Swiss Central Bank as saying that East Germany's short-, middle- and long-term obligations to Western creditors totaled $20 billion. This sum would put East Germany's per capita foreign debt close to or ahead of those of Hungary and Poland. **********Seeking to defend his performance as planning chief in the Government of the ousted party leader, Erich Honecker, Mr. Schurer said he had been unable to block excessive investments in the electronics industry and other areas of the economy. **********Mr. Schurer said that all of his proposals to ease the economic situation were ''rejected by the Central Committee Secretary for Economy, Gunter Mittag, with attacks and false accusation.'' Mr. Mittag, a Honecker associate, was dismissed from the Central Committee last week. **********The planning chief was backed up by Willi Stoph, the former Prime Minister, who told the Parliament with bitterness in his voice that his own efforts in economic policy-making had been subverted by Mr. Mittag, who he said had approved huge investments in the electronics and fertilizer industries without informing him or his aides. Flight of Skilled Workers **********The fresh gaps in the economy created by the flight of skilled workers and professionals was underlined in a report today by Berliner Zeitung, which said the departures registered since June included doctors and transport personnel. It named the Narva electrical products factory as one of the big losers. And a person knowledgeable about health personnel said today that more than 200 staff members had fled from the well-known Charite Hospital. About 1,200 East Germans fled to West Germany today, either directly or by way of Czechoslovakia. **********Adding to these problems are the relatively new phenomena of large-scale smuggling and hoarding, according to Gunther Arndt, deputy head of East Germany's Customs Administration. **********Edda Kaiser, an executive of the Centrum department store in Berlin, said in an interview about those problems, ''It is an untenable situation for our house and surely for similar establishments, not only in Berlin.'' Berliner Zeitung, which quoted Mrs. Kaiser, said the offenders were mostly Poles and members of the American, British and French forces stationed in West Berlin. These people can purchase East German marks at a very low rate outside this country. Although the official exchange rate is 1.85 East German marks to the dollar, the currency can be exchanged outside at a black-market rate of over 10 marks per dollar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/23/world/chinese-execute-24-more-people-including-7-from-beijing-protests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1082, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chinese Execute 24 More People, Including 7 From Beijing Protests", "print_headline": "Chinese Execute 24 More People, Including 7 From Beijing Protests", "body_text": " **********Twenty-four executions were reported in China today, bringing to 27 the number of people executed in two days. **********The authorities announced that seven people were executed in Beijing today for their role in violent anti-Government protests, and editors at Jinan Daily News in the eastern city of Jinan said 17 people were executed there on Wednesday, immediately after being sentenced. **********But the editors said that these 17 people were common criminals whose activities were unrelated to the democracy movement. This could not be confirmed, and the only official report about them has said they were accused of ''seriously endangering public order.'' Foreign Press Not Admitted **********One of the seven executed in Beijing may have been a woman, based on videotapes shown on television. All seven were workers, like all the others known to have been sentenced. While many students have been arrested, they have apparently not yet been tried. **********Official information about the trials and executions has been scarce and sometimes conflicting. On some occasions, the condemned have been paraded before large crowds before execution, but officials have not permitted foreign journalists to attend the trials or these gatherings. **********If the new executions followed the standard practice, the condemned were taken to a field outside the city and forced to kneel with their hands tied behind their back. Then they would have been executed with a pistol shot at the base of the skull. **********Leaders around the world have denounced the executions, reports of which began with the official announcement Wednesday that three protesters in Shanghai had been executed. The three were accused of helping to set fire to a train, after the train plowed into a human blockade and killed six people in a crowd that until then had been demonstrating peacefully. Sentences in Shanghai **********While the Government asserted again today that it would never bow to foreign pressure, there were indications that the authorities were no longer issuing death sentences as frequently as they had been. **********The official New China News Agency reported today that six young men who were also involved in the Shanghai train fire had been sentenced not to death but to prison for periods ranging from five years to life. **********The evening radio news also reported that in the central Chinese city of Changsha, 27 people had been sentenced to prison for taking part in violent anti-Government demonstrations on April 22. One of the 27 was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, intended to give him a chance to demonstrate a change of heart and win commutation to life imprisonment, but none were sentenced to be executed immediately. **********''These criminal elements had a hand in beating, smashing and looting,'' the radio declared. It accused rioters in Changsha of wounding 21 policemen, damaging five cars, looting 32 stores and causing direct economic losses of about $150,000. Last Item on News Program **********Until Wednesday, all eight people whose sentences had been publicly reported had been sentenced to death. But none of those whose sentences were announced today were sentenced to death immediately. **********In what might also be a sign that the Government is becoming more sensitive about executions, the national television news did not broadcast news of the seven executed in Beijing. There was a brief mention on the Beijing city news, but it was the very last item in a half-hour news program. **********A day earlier, People's Daily had called for the cases of such ''counterrevolutionaries'' to be given extensive publicity to frighten criminals and encourage the masses to report on them. **********The seven workers who were executed today in Beijing were sentenced Saturday after being found guilty of attacking army troops and vehicles on June 4, when troops stormed the center of the city and repeatedly clashed with pro-democracy demonstrators. Troops fired on crowds with their submachine guns, and demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs at troops whenever they had the opportunity. One May Be on Appeal **********It is not clear exactly what role the seven had played, nor what evidence there was against them. At the time of the sentencing, eight were given the death penalty, suggesting that one may still be on appeal. **********The authorities have seemed more deferential when arresting student leaders than when seizing workers, and those students shown on television have not shown signs of having been beaten up the way many workers have. **********The higher status of university students, compared with workers, may be the reason the Government has shown reluctance to execute them and to risk making martyrs of them. Yet few who follow the events here will rule out the possibility that some students may be executed. **********Still, the official propaganda has been extremely critical of several of the student leaders for inciting the ''counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' #13 Accused of Aiding Taiwan The Government has also accused some of the arrested students of taking part in violent attacks on troops in the clashes on June 4, in addition to leading the peaceful protest movement. **********The Government also announced the arrest of 13 men it accused of being secret agents for the Taiwan Government. The New China News Agency said the agents had been trained to stir up unrest at the recent pro-democracy demonstrations, and it showed videotapes of some of them taking part in demonstrations. **********The 13 had operated in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Canton and other areas of the country, but while they apparently represented a significant network there was no indication that any of them had access to any secret information they could have given Taiwan. The authorities did not indicate how the 13 were caught, but the news programs said they had been arrested in small groups beginning on May 19 and ending today. **********In its first direct comment on the Bush Administration's announcement on Tuesday that it would suspend high-level contacts with China and that it would seek to postpone new loans to China from international institutions, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that foreign countries should stop interfering in China's internal affairs. **********''The Chinese have never yielded to any external pressure,'' a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Li Jinhua, said.

But the diplomats said they believed that the accounts were correct, and two Hong Kong student leaders who helped to raise money for the demonstrators in China confirmed the escapes. **********Hong Kong and its 5.7 million people are scheduled to revert to China in 1997 under an agreement in which the Communists pledged to let Hong Kong continue practicing capitalism for 50 years. Confidence Shaken **********But the crackdown in Beijing on June 4 has shaken confidence here, raising fears about the territory's future and spreading concern among residents that Hong Kong should avoid doing anything to offend China. **********There are fears here that if people in Hong Kong were involved in helping arrange the escapes, this could lead to charges by Beijing that Hong Kong was being used as a base for subversion, a situation the colony's British administration has always sought to avoid. **********One dissident, Wuer Kaixi, a charismatic 21-year-old leader of the Independent Students Union in Beijing, which is now banned, appeared on Hong Kong television in a taped interview Wednesday night. Neither the television station nor the students who provided the tape would say when or where it was made. **********In the interview, Mr. Wuer called the Communist Government ''a batch of reactionary warlords and fascists'' and predicted its demise in six months to three years. **********In contrast to the Communist view that the student union was illegal, Mr. Wuer said: ''It is they who are illegal. A government that opens fire on the people is, of course, illegal.'' **********The tape was furnished to Asia Television in Hong Kong by some of the local student organizers. Pao Wan-lung, the news editor of the station, said there had been a heated debate over whether to broadcast the tape because Mr. Wuer's remarks might be ''too radical'' for Hong Kong. **********Among the others who are said to have been brought out of China by an underground network are Chai Ling, a Beijing University student who ran the demonstrators' headquarters in Tiananmen Square, and Yan Jiaqi, 47 years old, a close adviser to Zhao Ziyang, the ousted General Secretary of the Communist Party. On Wanted Lists **********Mr. Yan, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, provided much of the philosophical inspiration for the demonstrations and headed a newly created group, the Beijing Association of Intellectuals. **********Another who was said to have been smuggled out of China was Wan Runnan, who founded China's first private computer company, the Stone Corporation, and provided financial aid to the demonstrators. **********Mr. Wuer and Miss Chai are on the Communists' list of 21 students accused of inciting a ''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' in Beijing. Mr. Yan and Mr. Wan are on a separate list of seven intellectuals sought by the police. **********All four dissidents, along with Mr. Wuer's companion, Miss Chai's companion and Mr. Yan's wife have already been secretly taken out of Hong Kong and are now in the United States, Europe and Australia, the Hong Kong student organizers said. Appearance Planned July 4 **********The local students said the dissidents hope to appear in public on July 4, exactly a month after the shootings in Beijing, to announce the establishment of the Independent Students Union in exile. **********They might appear at rallies in Washington, London or Paris, the Hong Kong students said. **********The Hong Kong students declined to say how the dissidents had escaped a nationwide manhunt in China. But over the last two years, as the Communists carried out economic initiatives and relaxed many of their controls, networks of smugglers grew up, with officials and fishermen along the coast near Hong Kong and Macao prepared to do business for a price. **********There was also speculation that intelligence agencies on Taiwan may have helped in the escape, and in the case of Miss Chai, that she had assistance from the Australian Embassy in Beijing, where some reports said she sought refuge after the military crackdown. An Australian diplomat said he had no information about Miss Chai. 'Devisive for Hong Kong' **********A spokesman for the Hong Kong Government said, ''I couldn't even possibly comment.'' **********However they managed to get out, their escape would constitute a major breach of security in China and would pose a further embarrassement for the Communists. **********Over the last two weeks Chinese officials have sought to assure Hong Kong that Beijing will stick to its promise of autonomy, under the policy of ''one country, two systems.'' But these officials have also warned that actions by Hong Kong Chinese in raising money for the demonstrators and taking part in the pro-democracy movement inside China constitutes subversion. **********''The escapes pose a very devisive issue for Hong Kong,'' said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist and the dean of the School of Arts at the Open Learning Institute, a new university here. ''Many people here say, let's not do anything to antagonize China.'' Beaming News to China **********''But a small minority now realize Hong Kong's only protection from China in 1997 is to get a democratic government there, and they are willing to try to help the democracy movement,'' Mr. Cheng said. **********In fact, an increasing number of people here are taking action likely to upset Beijing. One group has started a small radio station beaming news to China to counter the Communists' propaganda campaign about the demonstrations. **********Some lawyers are trying to document the killings in central Beijing. And another group has put up a likeness of the Goddess of Democracy, the statue crafted by students in Beijing modeled after the Statue of Liberty. **********Mr. Wuer, a member of the Uighur minority from Xinjiang Province in the far northwest of China, gained fame when he repeatedly criticized Prime Minister Li Peng in a televised meeting between students and Government leaders. 'The Judgment of History' **********In his 23-minute taped interview shown here Wednesday, he admitted that the students had been ''naive'' about the Communists. ''We had not realized how despicable these wild beasts could be,'' he said. **********''The real counterrevolutionaries, the rebellious hooligans, are Li Peng, Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun,'' he said. Mr. Deng is China's senior leader, and Mr. Yang is the President. **********''They will receive the judgment of history,'' Mr. Wuer said. **********Mr. Wuer said the objective was not only to overthrow Mr. Li, who became a particular target during the protests, but also ''to establish in China a political system of checks and balances and a truly democratic machinery.'' **********Mr. Yan, the adviser to Mr. Zhao, said in a booklet published in Hong Kong this week that China should follow the American system of a three-way division of power, ''depoliticize the military, make the Constitution supreme and obey the rule of law.'' **********Mr. Deng's ''extermination policy'' will ''not only increase the hatred of the people but sow the seeds of democracy and freedom in more and more people,'' Mr. Yan said.

Gorbachev. Mr. Bush's audacious new plan for the conventional arms talks in Vienna, and his success in persuading his allied colleagues to endorse it, fulfilled that first important demand. **********Everybody also said he must avoid a rift in the alliance, and he did that, too, steering a steady course between Britain and West Germany on the vexatious question of negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. **********''I think he's given a very clear lead,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said about a man whom she has been widely suspected of wanting to supplant at the helm of the alliance. They Liked What They Saw **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d insisted that ''there is no change in course'' and said ''the fact that the President has put a bold proposal on the table does not mean he has abandoned prudence.'' **********But the allies saw change, whatever Mr. Baker said, and they liked what they saw. That strengthens the President's hand for future dealings with them, and the reaction on Capitol Hill will probably help Mr. Bush in that arena as well. **********''From our point of view, the picture has changed radically in the last five days,'' said a senior official at the Foreign Ministry here in Bonn, where Mr. Bush has been subject to intense cricitism over the last couple of months. **********''There no more of this leaning back and enjoying the show that you used to hear from the White House. Now the President is talking about making the most of our great opportunity. That's more like it.'' 'Thoroughly Professional' **********It was not only the President's new, less passive approach - the willingness of this deeply cautious man to aggressively seize the moment when it had seemed he would shrink from doing so - that most of the allies liked. **********They were impressed by the care with which Mr. Bush sounded them out through a variety of channels before the Brussels meetings even began, by his success in keeping his initiative secret almost until it was unveiled publicly and by his generosity in crediting the alliance and not just himself. **********''Very thoroughly professional,'' the long-serving Belgian Foreign Minister, Leo Tindemans, said in a comment echoed by many Europeans. **********Mr. Bush believes he has turned a major corner in his Presidency, one of his intimates reported tonight. He himself said that ''whatever political arrows have been fired my way, it has all been worth it.'' But by all accounts the arrows stung more than he wished to let on, and had much to do with his decision to develop a major new policy in only a week or so. **********Despite the President's comment that ''I haven't felt under siege because I knew all along exactly what we wanted to do,'' a senior United States arms-control official said of Mr. Bush's initiative, ''This was an improvisation, pure and simple.'' **********One sign of the hasty nature of Mr. Bush's initiative was the inclusion of aircraft in the American proposal for the conventional arms negotiations. **********Less than 10 days ago, American officials senior enough to have known if the Administration's stance was about to be changed were telling reporters with some passion why such an inclusion - long sought by Moscow, long denied by Washington - would be unacceptable. **********Suddenly, talking about aircraft was described as wholly logical by United States officials explaining the change of tack in Brussels. Expected Divergences **********There were the expected divergences over what the compromise language on short-term missiles meant; it was cooked up by Mr. Baker with the precise intent, as he frankly acknowledged, of fuzzing the question of the minimum number of such weapons the allies would accept. Mrs. Thatcher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and their aides took some thinly disguised potshots at each other, indicating that the conference had produced no nirvana of good feeling among nations. **********But there was no divergence at all on the overall outcome. The conference was universally acclaimed as a triumph, even by Mrs. Thatcher, who probably had to move further from her base position than anyone else. Mr. Bush will be very fortunate indeed if he matches this outcome at another major international conference, especially one like the Brussels meeting, where there had been no opportunity to write the usual ''script'' in advance. **********Now the technical experts must try to put the President's proposals in fuller form, confronting the colossal complexity of such matters as the means of counting, destroying and verifying the destruction of tanks and planes. Those complexities, together with the problems of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union, cast the one real cloud over Brussels. **********Mr. Bush proposed to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on conventional arms within six months to a year after the next round of talks opens in Vienna in September, but few people think that is very probable. Task Seen as Difficult **********Manfred Worner, the Secretary General of NATO, said ''it will not be easy.'' Mrs. Thatcher said of the timetable, ''I think that's a little bit optimistic, I think it's quite optimistic, I think it's very optimistic.'' Even Secretary Baker spoke of an optimistic but realistic plan of action. **********Talking with his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, after the final communique had been approved but before his news conference, the President said he was worrying about how to develop a sufficient head of steam behind the talks in Vienna, suggesting that he knows full well he has given a hostage to fortune by setting 1991 as a target date for finishing work at Vienna. **********But Mr. Bush has shown that he can play and win at Mr. Gorbachev's game.

The Yankees' over-the-air broadcaster, WPIX, is broadcasting another 75 games a season, with the remaining 12 games reserved for national broadcasts. **********The systems had sought to charge for the games as options, as they had through last season when they were carried by Sportschannel. The MSG network wanted its programming included in the systems' basic packages to have as large a viewer base as possible for advertisers. **********In December, the Yankees and MSG signed a $500 million deal that provides for the network to carry 75 games this season and next, and 150 games a year for the next 10 years. The deal is expected to serve as a model for other professional teams. **********The dispute between MSG and the cable systems reflects a nationwide battle over access to televised sports events and how much of the cost of providing such coverage will be passed on to viewers. **********MSG officials said the agreements with the three New York City systems and a number of systems in New York State and Connecticut brought the total number of cable subscribers receiving Yankee games in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to 2.2 million, or almost two-thirds of the 3.5 million cable households in the three states. **********The major holdouts continue to be Cablevision, which has 750,000 subscribers on Long Island and elsewhere in the New York suburbs, and two affiliated systems, Brooklyn-Queens Cable and Queens Inner Unity Cable System, which have a total of about 120,000 subscribers. **********At the request of the New York State Commission on Cable Television, Cablevision, which had dropped the MSG network in a dispute over whether Knick basketball and Ranger hockey games would be part of its basic service or an extra-cost option, agreed yesterday to restore Knick and Rangers games for this season's playoffs without an extra charge to subscribers. **********The hockey playoffs began last night, with the Rangers losing their opening game with the Pittsburgh Penguins. **********Although neither the cable operators nor the network would disclose details of the five-year agreement reached yesterday, it appeared to be a clear victory for MSG, which had insisted that the Yankee games be carried as part of the systems' basic service. **********The agreements also represented a victory for Yankee fans among the systems' subscribers since with the games part of the basic service the cost will be shared by all subscribers, something the operators had argued was unfair, especially in view of the high cost of the Yankee package. **********The agreements vastly increase the number of subscribers who will receive Yankee games.

German unification, a taboo subject until a few months ago, is becoming a realistic prospect. After Austria - a neutral country - it will soon be Hungary's turn to request associate status in the European Community. **********The movement for democratization will not leave the Warsaw Pact unscathed. NATO will also have to evolve as the postwar Yalta order crumbles. A new European order is clearly on the agenda. **********In light of this, Europeans and people outside the region are asking if the goal of creating a single market, to be completed in 1992, will still be Europe's central program. The answer to this question must be a firm ''yes.'' In addition, the European Community must add to the single market program the economic and monetary union of its member countries. In this way, Europe will have the strength to deal with the rapid changes in the world. **********It is commonly acknowledged that by launching the 1992 single-market project, Europe has gained new momentum. But however important this new momentum may be, the significance of the 1992 single market should not be overstated. That is because the individual countries of Europe remain autonomous and independent when it comes to control over economic and financial matters. The result is a conflict between growing economic integration on the one hand and fragmented political decision-making power on the other. This disparity between national and shared control cripples Europe's abilty to deal with the challenges of a globalizing world economy and a newly democratic Eastern Europe. **********If Europe is firm in its goal of developing genuine economic and financial unity, it can only take place within the framework of a single currency. In the 19th century, the economic unification of Germany and of Italy was only realized after each of these countries created its own central bank. These central banks were then able to issue the German reichmark and the Italian lira, which were necessary in order to unify commerce within these countries. In the United States, the dollar is what made it a single market. **********Today, with the purely national currencies circulating within the European Community member states, intra- and extra-Community trade is treated in an identical manner with respect to each country's trade balance and exchange accounts. Merchandise or services traded between Belgium and France - or France and Germany - have the same economic and financial significance as trade between France and Japan or the United States which are not community members. This means that trade still takes place in Europe as if the European Community did not exist. Every E.C. member country has to balance its accounts with the E.C. and the world. **********This archaic and absurd situation handicaps all member countries and reduces their potential for economic growth. The United States does not have to take into account the balance of trade or different exchange rates between Texas and California or Michigan and Florida in its internal accounting. Europe should not have to either. **********The advantages of a single European currency are clear: the disappearance of exchange operations between the economies of the 12 countries. Interest rates would be harmonized within the E.C. In addition, the European Currency Unit, the monetary unit of the single European market, would wield considerable economic weight and take its place alongside the dollar and the yen in managing the world monetary system. **********Monetary integration would create a truly unified economic region, overseen by a European central bank system, somewhat analogous to the Federal Reserve. This would call for an economic union of closely coordinated budgetary, fiscal, monetary and even - to a certain degree - incomes policies. **********Only a more integrated European Community - based upon a genuine economic and monetary union - will have the economic strength and united political perspective to welcome the democratizing Eastern European countries into its fold. Only an economically united Europe -leading possibly even to a confederation of European states - will have the strength to solve the problem of the reunification of Germany. **********Since the days of the Marshall Plan, The United States has been a staunch supporter of the idea of a single, united Europe. The United States should continue to pursue this goal. A strong, united Europe will be a reliable partner for the United States in the quest for a new world order - an order in which both NATO and the Warsaw Pact undergo dramatic change."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/03/business/jacobs-offers-to-buy-avon-for-2.2-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Freitag", "pub_date": "1989-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jacobs Offers to Buy Avon for $2.2 Billion", "print_headline": "Jacobs Offers to Buy Avon for $2.2 Billion", "body_text": " **********Irwin L.

Some said a normal spring selling season would do the job by itself; others argued that excessive stocks of cars at the General Motors Corporation would lead that company to begin another round of discounts . **********In the Feb. 21-28 period, sales of American-made cars and light trucks totaled 324,351, off 14.3 percent from the comparable period last year, the eight domestic manufacturers reported today. But sales were exceptionally strong in the period last year, after the stock-market crash. Average Daily Sales **********For the month, domestic car sales averaged 23,002 a day, down 11.4 percent from February 1988, while imported cars averaged 8,238 sales a day, down 13.3 percent. Domestic trucks were down 5.8 percent, to 13,171 a day, and imported trucks were down 18.8 percent, to 1,638 a day. **********There were seven selling days in late February this year and last; there were 24 selling days in the month this year and 25 days last year. **********Domestic cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.6 million in Feb. 21-28 period, bringing the overall rate for the month to 7.1 million. Imports, meanwhile, sold at a 2.7 million rate, well below their 3.0 million rate a year earlier. Annualized rates were based on a formula devised by the Department of Commerce. **********Scott Merlis, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley, in New York, said today's sales report was better than he had expected and augured well for the spring. **********''I believe inventories are a tad high but tolerable, and we do not see Draconian rebates now,'' Mr. Merlis said. ''If sales come in a little over a seven million annual rate in March, further incentives will not be necessary.'' Ford's Production **********This view appeared to gain support today from the Ford Motor Company's announcement that it has added 27,000 cars and 18,000 trucks to its second-quarter production plan. At the same time, Ford renewed its existing incentive program, which was to have expired today, with only minor changes. **********But Michael M. Luckey, an independent auto analyst, interpreted Ford's move as an anticipation of imminent discounting by General Motors. Ford would want more cars on hand to fuel the sales a price war would stimulate, he said. **********Mr. Luckey predicted that G.M. would begin new incentives, even though he estimated that it has actually reduced its car inventory to 85 days' supply, from 95 days at the end of January. Ford has about 80 days and Chrysler about 90, he added. **********''If we don't see these incentives sweetened, by the end of March the industry will have higher inventories and will have to make some tough choices on production,'' Mr. Luckey said. ''Besides, G.M. has said to analysts, in so many words, that it has set aside additional money for incentives.'' Incentives Are Expected **********Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst for Duff & Phelps, in Chicago, agreed that incentives were bound to increase. He predicted they would strengthen later in the model year, which ends in September. **********Ford was the only Big Three auto maker to increase its share of the market for all cars and light trucks, domestic and imported. Ford had a 25.6 percent market share, up 2 percentage points from February 1988. General Motors lost 2.6 percentage points, taking 35.8 percent of the market; Chrysler lost 1.2 points, taking 14 percent. **********Mr. Merlis of Morgan Stanley said the poor performance of imported vehicles confirmed a pattern he said had been forming for months. ''The decline in imports is a serious trend, not a blip on the radar screen,'' he said. ''The reason is that after the last round of price increases, in September, imports went from pricey to very pricey.''

That is essentially the situation that most railroads are in, said Todd Burger, a senior transportation consultant at Arthur D. Little. Most customers call just a few days ahead for rail cars. **********Shortly after deregulation, carriers began scheduling in advance intermodal traffic - trains carrying ship containers and truck trailers, recalled Mr. Burger. As a result, the productivity of intermodal equipment is now higher than that of most of the industry's standard rail cars, he said. **********While only about 10 percent of the nation's rail freight is now reserved in advance, more railroads are expected to move in this direction. By doing so, they will be able to better predict demand and put their cars and locomotives to better use. And rather than charging fixed rates, they can price according to demand. **********''If 50 percent to 75 percent of the freight isn't scheduled by 2010, I'd be greatly surprised,'' Mr. Burger said. **********Recently, carriers have begun scheduling grain freight in advance. Last year, for instance, Burlington Northern set up a program under which grain shippers could bid for space on its scheduled trains. **********Locking in rates and equipment for future shipments enables the shippers to plan ahead and minimize the risk of not getting a car. While shippers sometimes negotiate contracts with a railroad, they more typically buy space on the spot market for rates listed publicly by the carrier. **********In either case, the railroads only commit to furnish the car within ''a reasonable period,'' said Roger Sperry, a grain specialist at Burlington Northern. That could mean waiting two weeks or more for a car, he said. **********Burlington is now handling about 40 percent of its grain traffic through the bidding process. It says it will expand the process to other freight if customers demand it. **********The program vastly improves the railroad's efficiency. By accommodating demand it previously could not, Burlington Northern is now running about 23 trips per year with its trains, compared with the national average of 12 per year. **********''We can evaluate the need for equipment six months out,'' Mr. Sperry said. ''Up until now, most carriers had no idea what demand would be.'' **********Having a more accurate picture of future demand could also enable railroads to reduce their fleets. By reserving space and taking other steps to increase productivity, the railroads could cut their fleets to about 850,000 railcars by the year 2010, from 1.3 million today, Mr. Burger said. That could generate a one-time savings of about $3 billion. **********The reservation system could also lead to higher revenues. Railroads, after all, could start pricing their service more competitively. They could increase prices when demand was brisk and reduce them when they needed to fill empty freight cars, said Mr. Burger. And the rails could charge customers needing freight to arrive quickly higher rates than they charge those that are not in a hurry, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/29/business/china-in-crackdown-orders-many-companies-to-close.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1989-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China, in Crackdown, Orders Many Companies to Close", "print_headline": "China, in Crackdown, Orders Many Companies to Close", "body_text": " **********Continuing a crackdown on private enterprise that began after the crushing of the democracy movement in June, China announced today that it would close a large number of privately owned companies. **********The Government's lengthy announcement of the new policy on page 1 of The People's Daily said that ''too many companies have been set up'' and in many cases ''management was in great disorder.'' It also said that private salaries have soared out of control for some top company officials and charged that Government officials have taken stakes in the companies they were regulating, leading to ''embezzelement, theft, profiteering and bribery.'' **********The announcement appeared to focus on Chinese-owned businesses and there was no immediate indication that the Government expected or wanted it to have any effect on the foreign companies that have ventures here. But foreigners and Chinese alike have said the Government is adopting a more hostile attitude toward private enterprise here and is starting to reassert control over the sectors of the economy that slipped its grasp as capitalism took hold. **********Private enterprises in Beijing in particular were deeply involved in the democracy movement that was crushed in June. There has been widespread speculation in the diplomatic community that Government officials are trying to punish shops and factories that gave student demonstrators food, money and equipment. **********Some observers suggested that the move bore the stamp of Jiang Zemin, the new Communist Party leader, who is generally viewed as being more comfortable with a centrally planned economy. **********The article in The People's Daily set no target for the number of private enterprises to be eliminated. But it suggested that some have already been ordered closed. It is estimated that there are about 14.5 million businesses here that each employ fewer than eight people, and 225,000 that employ more. They account for only 3.5 percent of China's economy, but they have been the fastest-growing sector. **********Their growth has highlighted the weaknesses of many of the state enterprises. In July, Chinese officials said that about 20 percent of the state-owned businesses are now operating at a loss. **********Earlier this month the Government said it was beginning an inspection of all individually owned businesses, because of suspicions that they are avoiding taxes. It was not clear whether today's announcement was related to the earlier move. Process Will End in April **********The People's Daily article today said that the ''screening and rectification'' of companies would be finished by next April. While its criteria for eliminating companies appeared vague, the Government said that the first to close would be those that were ''an unnecessary copy of another company'' or in violation of a rule prohibiting Government administrators and Communist Party officials from taking part in running the companies. In some cases administrators who also have a stake in the companies they oversee have been reported to be a major source of corruption in China's economy. **********''Those who still hold responsibility in the companies should give up their Government and party posts,'' the article said. ''Companies with business power and at the same time administrative power will not be approved.'' **********It also said that ''special privileges'' enjoyed by some companies would be revoked. **********It is not at all clear that the closing of the companies will have any significant effect on foreign companies operating in China. In recent weeks officials here have gone out of their way to stress that foreign investment is still welcome, meeting with bankers and industrialists and stressing that the anarchy in the streets during the May and June rebellions is over. **********''I think there is a consensus among the senior leadership that the policy of openness will continue,'' said A. Robert Abboud, the chairman of First City Bancorporation of Texas and the head of a joint venture with a Chinese bank. Speaking in Tokyo during the weekend, on his way home from a meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng, Mr. Abboud said that the Chinese were trying to make a basic realignment of their economy. Debate Has Just Begun **********But if the Chinese press is any indication, the debate over how to reorganize the economy has just begun. **********For example, in a lengthy article in the English language China Daily today, an unidentified official wrote, ''The Government will not tolerate indiscriminate Westernization and bourgeois liberalization, but it will continue to absorb and assimilate advanced foreign technology and management techniques.''

The new President, who took office after the assassination of Rene Moawad last week, also threatened to use force against the general if he continued his armed opposition. **********General Aoun, who considers himself the leader of Lebanon and has refused to accept the election of Mr. Hrawi by Parliament, commands a force of Christian troops of the national army and militiamen estimated at 15,000. President Hrawi has the support of Muslim elements of the national army as well as 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in the country. A Shift in the Balance **********President Hrawi was elected in a process set up by an accord of Muslim and Christian members of Parliament approved in Saudi Arabia last month. The accord provides more political power for Muslims in Lebanon, at the expense of the Christians. The old political balance favored the Christians, who are now outnumbered by Muslims. **********General Aoun denounced the accord because it does not provide for a scheduled departure of Syrian troops, who have been here since 1976 as a peacekeeping force authorized by the Arab League. The general, a Maronite Christian, considers Christians who approved the accord and elected Mr. Moawad and Mr. Hrawi as traitors. **********The main road linking Beirut to the north with southern Lebanon was jammed today with cars carrying furniture and bedding that were leaving for safer areas outside the capital. **********A high-ranking Lebanese Army officer who requested anonymity said a showdown was being planned for as soon as the new President and his government appoint an army commander to challenge General Aoun's leadership. Syrians Moving Troops **********Members of the militia and the police confirmed that Syrian army units were being moved to positions facing General Aoun's stronghold in Baabda.

Toyota and G.M. have operated a plant in Fremont since 1983, producing the Geo Prizm, formerly called the Chevrolet Nova, and the nearly identical Toyota Corolla. **********A Toyota source said the company wants to begin producing trucks by the spring of 1990. **********After selling 384,000 trucks in the United States in 1986, Toyota's truck sales fell to 304,000 in 1987 and about 247,000 last year.

In addition, the American tariff has made Japanese trucks relatively expensive compared with those built domestically by G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.

Since Carlos Saul Menem took office two months ago, his Government has awarded 24 exploration contracts to private concerns, many of them foreign, including several American companies. **********But as it moves closer to the promised sale of pieces of the state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the Government expects a conflict with the strongly nationalistic views of the oil workers union. Rampant Inflation **********The company, known as Y.P.F., is an example of the problems the Menem Government faces in trying to reduce the state's role in the Argentine economy. The effort will require bringing fiscal order and better management to more than a dozen state companies that account for most of the immense fiscal deficit, which, in turn, is blamed for the country's vulnerability to rampant inflation. **********Octavio Frigerio, who was named by Mr. Menem to head Y.P.F., inherited a company with an operating deficit running at an annual rate of more than $1 billion. He said that much of the deficit was the result of selling gasoline at the pump far below international prices and that the situation had been corrected by raising them to about $1.50 for a gallon of premium-grade gas, more than three times what they were two months ago. **********Mr. Frigerio said the basic requirement for reorganization of the state companies was ''mostly political.'' Against the Heritage **********In deciding to turn the Argentine economy more toward free enterprise, President Menem is going against the heritage of his Justicialist Party and the political movement founded four decades ago by Juan D. Peron. Until now, its basic tenets had been economic nationalism and a big role for the state in the economy. **********The choice of Mr. Frigerio to run Y.P.F. reflects the drastic shift that Mr. Menem has led in his party. Mr. Frigerio is an economist known for free-market thinking, and not a Peronist. His father, Rogelio, was a leading adviser to President Arturo Frondizi, whose 1958-62 Government unsuccessfully attempted a similar opening of the economy. **********Many in Peronism, including the labor movement, the traditional backbone of the party, still differ with Mr. Menem. The union representing the 36,000 state oil workers has been in the forefront of opposition. **********Diego Ibanez, secretary general of the oil workers union, declined to be interviewed, but his public statements suggest that he wants Argentine oil production to be used mainly to assist the nation's industrial growth, without the country trying to become an exporter, and that he does not want Y.P.F. broken up. 'Mix of Distinct Interests' **********Mr. Frigerio said he considered the labor opposition to his plans to be based on ''a complex mix of distinct interests, part ideological and partly an attempt to protect old corporativist privileges.'' **********The term corporativism is used in Argentina to describe the custom of interests, like labor and private enterprise, negotiating shares of power and income without concern for productivity, quality or competition. **********Mr. Frigerio said he believed that the oil workers would be better off in the long run ''if Y.P.F. becomes professional, modern and internationally competitive.'' **********Before the end of the year, Mr. Frigerio said, he expects to come up with a plan to sell pieces of the firm as private operations. Possibilities include the shipping fleet, the drilling activity and the gas stations. Then, he said, the production section would remain as a much smaller firm or would disappear as private companies took on its functions. **********He said the Government was not making any plans to dismiss oil workers, even though he said that their salaries were double the national average for industrial wages and that he thought it took ''about four people in Y.P.F. to do what one person does in a private firm.'' He said he had found Y.P.F. to be ''organically inefficient.'' No Confrontation **********Despite this, he said he was not going to confront the union over the size of the work force because salaries account for only 6 percent of the Y.P.F. budget. Argentina has no unemployment insurance system, another reason the Menem Government is trying to avoid dismissals. **********Until the Alfonsin Government initiated the change in oil policy, the oil business in Argentina was dominated by the state. The private companies here either worked on drilling contracts for Y.P.F. or exploited fields after Y.P.F. abandoned them. Now, the emphasis is on private exploration, with production itself to be either by Y.P.F. or the private companies. **********The exploration contracts signed in the last two months constituted the fourth round in the series of auctions of exploration rights begun in 1986. The companies that signed those contracts are expected to invest $266 million. **********The extent of Argentina's oil and gas reserves is unknown because only a small percentage of the sedimentary basins, both on land and offshore, has been explored. The country is considered self-sufficient in oil. **********Many Argentine oil experts contend that the country would never be an important oil producer, but Mr. Frigerio said that is a premature judgment. **********''I think we could have a lot of oil,'' he said, ''and, above all, a lot of gas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/12/business/household-to-quit-manufacturing.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1989-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 985, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Household to Quit Manufacturing", "print_headline": "Household to Quit Manufacturing", "body_text": " **********In a major restructuring, Household International Inc. said today that it would leave the manufacturing business and return to its roots - providing financial services to individuals and small businesses. **********Saying that the stock market has not recognized the success of its manufacturing operations, Household said it would spin off to shareholders three of those operations and would sell six others. It will use the proceeds to pare debt and add capital to its financial-services businesses. **********The manufacturing units, which produce such familiar products as Thermos insulated bottles and Eljer bathroom fixtures, are substantial. Analysts estimate they provided roughly $1 billion of Household's $4.6 billion in 1988 revenues and approximately $60 million of its $248 million in profit. Stock Jumps $5.25 **********Wall Street welcomed the news. Household's shares soared $5.25, or 9.2 percent, to close today at $62.375 after a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The Prospect Heights, Ill., company was founded 110 years ago as Household Finance, a consumer finance company lending money to individuals out of storefronts. Household's ''HFC'' logotype has been a familiar sight in small-town America. **********Beginning in the mid-1960's, Household began to branch out. It first acquired a string of merchandisers, including a furniture retailer, a hardware chain, variety stores and a supermarket. It then entered manufacturing, acquiring building-products and industrial-products concerns and makers of consumer goods. It acquired National Car Rental in 1969. Household's revenues peaked at $8.3 billion in 1984. **********In recent years, however, the stock market has generally frowned upon conglomerates. As a result, Household has been busy reversing its earlier diversification efforts. **********In 1985, for instance, the company sold its merchandising group to the group's managers in a leveraged buyout, using the proceeds to repurchase stock. In 1986, it sold National Car Rental to a group led by Paine Webber Inc. The company also used those proceeds to buy back stock, bringing the total share repurchases to 37 percent of Household's common shares outstanding. **********The divestiture of Household's manufacturing operations is thus the third and final component of a restructuring that will leave Household a pure financial-services company. The HFC unit will make consumer loans. The Household Commercial Finance group will lend money to small and medium-sized businesses. The Household Bank will offer checking and savings accounts. And Household will provide insurance through its Alexander Hamilton Life Insurance Company. 'It Fell Between the Cracks' **********The analysts have long thought that Household should have more of a focus and praised the move. ''This will force the stock market to value Household's financial-services businesses and manufacturing operations separately,'' said David Hochstim, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''Until now, the true value of this company was not fully recognized because it was neither a pure manufacturer nor a pure financial-services concern. As a result, it fell between the cracks.'' **********Fred. B. Wightman, a group vice president at Duff & Phelps Inc., said Household saw spinning off the manufacturing operations as ''the best path to higher shareholder value.'' **********Household's management agrees. In an interview today, Donald C. Clark, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the actions were not a result of any takeover threat but a reflection of Household's desire to win a higher value in the stock market for the manufacturing operations. **********''I always believed that, given enough of a track record, we could convince Wall Street to value the manufacturing operations at what they would have been valued at if they had been separate entities,'' Mr. Clark said. ''That never happened.'' Details of the Spin-offs **********Under what it expects will be a tax-free distribution to shareholders early next spring, Household will spin off its Eljer building products company, which markets kitchen and bath fixtures; its Schwitzer Inc., the maker of engine components, and its Scotsman Industries, which sells Scotsman ice machines and the Halsey Taylor water coolors. Terms calls for a distribution of one share in each of the three spun-off companies for every five shares of Household. **********Separately, Household will sell its Thermos Company, which makes insulated bottles, gas grills and ice chests; GC-Thorsen, which markets hand tools; Albion Industries, which makes casters for material-handling operations; King-Seeley, which makes components for cooking appliances; Omni Products International, which makes indoor and outdoor leisure furniture; and the Watertest Corporation, a provider of water-testing services. The companies have combined sales of $300 million and a value on Household's balance sheet of $120 million. **********Although the buyers have not yet been lined up, Household said its adviser, J. P. Morgan & Company, received many inquiries today. It said it expected to sell the companies for slightly more than $150 million, posting around a $30 million gain. Drop in Shareholders' Equity **********That gain will help reduce what could be a significant drop in Household's shareholders' equity, which currently stands at about $1.3 billion. It is expected that the spin-off will cut shareholders' equity by about $220 million. But the reduction will be cushioned by an $86 million dividend the spun-off companies are expected to pay the corporate parent before the spin-off and by the roughly $30 million gain on the asset sales. The net result is that Household's shareholders' equity will decline by about $100 million, or about 8 percent. **********For 1988, Mr. Clark said, Household expects its earnings per share to grow about 20 percent, to $6.40, following growth of 23 percent in 1987 and 22 percent in 1986. Return on equity, another major measure of corporate performance, should exceed 20 percent, Mr. Clark said, up from 19.4 percent in 1987 and 15.3 percent in 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/25/business/hoffmann-la-roche-plans-reorganization.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1989-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hoffmann-La Roche Plans Reorganization", "print_headline": "Hoffmann-La Roche Plans Reorganization", "body_text": " **********F.

The stocks of several American and European drug companies had climbed Friday on speculation that Hoffmann might make a bid for one of them. **********The reorganization is expected to make the company more attractive to investors by making it easier to understand and its stock more affordable. The company could then more easily raise money in foreign markets. **********Hoffmann-La Roche said yesterday that it would reorganize as a new holding company, Roche Holding A.G., and split its ''dividend shares,'' which have been thinly traded at about $95,000 each.

Lifland in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the unions asked that they be given until Monday to put together a business plan and an offer for the carrier. But after hearing arguments from lawyers for Eastern and the creditors' committee, Judge Lifland granted an extension until 2 P.M. today to try to get support for the plan from the unsecured creditors and from Eastern. Examiner Urges Extension **********During the hearing, David I. Shapiro, the examiner appointed by the judge in the case, said he had met early yesterday with the unions and Mr. Ritchie and had been persuaded that the group should be given until Monday to work on its bid . Their meeting at the Drake Hotel in Manhattan began at 1 A.M. yesterday and lasted for several hours. **********But when the lawyer for Mr. Ritchie, Michael J. Crames, pleaded for more time, Judge Lifland told him that Eastern was losing an estimated $1.7 million a day and was deteriorating as an asset. **********''Are you prepared to put up $1.7 million a day for your slippage?'' Judge Lifland asked Mr. Crames. The lawyer replied that he lacked such authority, and the judge then gathered his papers in a swoop and left the courtroom. The judge was referring to a deadline to deliver a business plan to the court by 6 P.M. yesterday. The Associated Press reported last night that Mr. Ritchie said that the plan was submitted shortly before the judge's deadline. Plea From Pilots' Union **********During the hearing, Bruce Simon, a lawyer for the pilots' union, pleaded for more time, saying that revising the plan would not be a simple process, involving changes in how to deploy aircraft and in what markets would be served. **********The original business plan developed by Mr. Ritchie and his group was based on the premise that America West Airlines Inc. would buy Eastern's shuttle as well as 10 of the carrier's Boeing 757 aircraft. **********But America West was unable to meet a deadline last week for completing its financing, and Donald J. Trump, the New York developer who had an agreement to buy the shuttle, has been given permission by the court to acquire the shuttle for $365 million. **********Thus, Mr. Ritchie's staff was scrambling yesterday to integrate the 10 aircraft into its plan. Final Transaction **********Nevertheless, some of Eastern's union leaders continued to cling to the hope that the last-ditch effort would work. Charles Bryan, the leader of the machinists' union, which began a strike on March 4 that has crippled most of Eastern's operations, said the Ritchie effort was the ''final big transaction'' the unions had been trying to put together. **********The underlying strategy of the unions, which are supporting the machinists' strike, has been to find a buyer for the airline and thus escape from the control of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, Eastern's parent. **********Mr. Shapiro, who has been given broad powers by Judge Lifland to put together a reorganization plan for the carrier as quickly as possible, expressed doubt over the Ritchie effort. **********In asking the judge to give Mr. Ritchie until Monday, he added, ''even though I do not believe that this plan is in the real world.'' **********Joel B. Zweibel, the attorney for the unsecured creditors' committee, and Harvey Miller, the head bankruptcy attorney for Eastern, said that Mr. Ritchie's group, after working for five weeks, had not presented them with a business plan or talked with Eastern's management. Agrees to Pay $3 Million **********In another court action involving Eastern yesterday, the Labor Department said the airline had consented in a court order to pay more than $3 million to some of its employee-benefit programs to resolve a complaint that it had improperly charged actuarial expenses to the employee plans. **********The department said that beginning in 1977, when Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc., a consulting firm in San Francisco, became the actuary for the Eastern plans, the airline violated the provisions of the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using insurance commissions of the plans to offset actuarial expenses. **********The department said that Eastern was permanently enjoined from using the assets of its employee-benefit plans to pay corporate expenses."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/23/business/business-digest-saturday-september-23-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 1989", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 1989", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********J.

Steinberg's Reliance Group. And each faces a major task: improving programming enough to attract young viewers who are increasingly turning to English-language stations. If Miami, with one of the most demographically attractive Hispanic audiences, cannot be made appealing to advertisers, other markets would be even more difficult. **********Half of Miami's two million people are Hispanic, and 60 percent of those are Cuban-Americans. Hispanic Miamians are more affluent and educated than their counterparts in other cities. Also, more of them watch Spanish-language television than do Hispanic Americans elsewhere. **********Hoping to capture some of those viewers, Miami's NBC affiliate, WTVJ, last month began a $250,000 radio and press campaign in Spanish. Other local English-language stations have recently increased coverage of Hispanic affairs and hired more Hispanic employees. All the stations indicated that their Hispanic audiences were growing, principally among viewers 18 to 49 years old. A Troubling Time **********The campaigns come at a difficult time for the two Spanish-language television stations here - WLTV, Channel 23, which is owned by the Univision network, under Hallmark, and WSCV, Channel 51, owned by the Telemundo network, under Reliance. For many months, the stations have been bitterly competing with each other for ratings; at the same time both have been criticized for poor quality in their news and entertainment programs. **********A special Nielsen ratings report completed last February found that 68 percent of Hispanic Miamians 18 to 49 years old watched English-language television, an increase of 5 percent over two years. Arbitron surveys last November found that the number of people watching Spanish-language television had dropped since July, and that most of the viewers were older people. **********In Los Angeles, the leading Hispanic market, only about 12 percent of some three million Hispanic viewers watch Spanish-language television, according to Jay Rodriguez, an NBC spokesman. **********In New York, the Nielsen and Arbitron ratings show that English-language stations have a virtual monopoly. The Hispanic audience is about 1.35 million. **********The Miami figures are troubling for the American corporate parents of the two stations. Hallmark spent more than $600 million to buy Univision. Reliance has invested an estimated $300 million in buying stations to create the Telemundo network. **********Henry R. Silverman, president of Telemundo Group, whose network owns six stations and has 22 affiliates, discounted the Nielsen and Arbitron ratings, calling the data flawed. But he added, ''There is no question that teen-age Hispanics are not watching Spanish-language programs, and we are doing everything we can to attract them, producing programs that are of interest to them.'' NBC Affiliate Sees Success **********Richard M. Lobo, president and general manager of WTVJ, the NBC affiliate, said last week that an increase in ratings at the station shown by the January Arbitron and Nielsen surveys was largely due to the effectiveness of his campaign to capture young Hispanic viewers. **********He added: ''In any case, the socioeconomic dynamics are irreversibly on the side of the English language. If there is no new massive Hispanic migration, in one generation Spanish-language television will become irrelevant as a market force.'' **********J. William Grimes, president of Univision Holding Inc., the parent company of Univision network, which comprises 9 fully owned and 21 affiliate stations, partly disagreed. He said that WTVJ's promotion might be initially successful, but that ''unless in Miami and elsewhere NBC provides programming and news relevant to Hispanic Americans, people will eventually turn away.'' Spanish Programs Assailed **********But Celedonio Gonzales, a Cuban born writer, was critical of the Spanish-language stations in Miami. ''The language on our local newscasts is atrocious, and the intellectual level of other programs could not be lower. Their 'novelas' shown ad nauseam actually offend the viewers' intelligence and are laughable to young Hispanic Americans.'' **********Novelas, some shown in prime time, are the equivalent of American soap operas. Produced inexpensively in Venezuela and Mexico, most of them have a story line in which someone rich falls in love with someone poor and the families oppose the match. And the acting is amateurish. **********Mr. Grimes conceded that the imported novelas are not a programming asset. ''We have had too many of them produced abroad,'' he said. ''Our first priority is to improve the quality of our programs and produce them here so that they are relevant to Hispanic Americans, but that cannot be done overnight.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/15/world/2-us-reporters-expelled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 U.S. Reporters Expelled", "print_headline": "2 U.S. Reporters Expelled", "body_text": " **********China ordered the expulsion of two Beijing-based American journalists, including one from the Voice of America.

Today's Labor Department report brought some relief to many participants in the financial markets, where prices were battered in the last few days by the report of a second straight 1 percent jump in the prices received by domestic producers. **********Many analysts said the moderate rise in the price index, after a climb of six-tenths of 1 percent in January that was the biggest in two years, would probably allow the Federal Reserve more time to evaluate the effect of the credit-tightening actions it has already taken. A poor February result, on the other hand, might have forced the central bank to raise interest rates to curb inflation by restraining the economy. **********Federal Reserve officials, for their part, give the impression that they will remain vigilant against inflation but not move toward sharply higher interest rates.  [ News analysis, page D1. ]  ''Fears of inflation accelerating out of control have proven premature,'' the National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement. ''After the temporary spike in the first quarter, inflation should settle down into the 5 percent range by midyear.'' **********A Labor Department official who compiles the price index, Patrick C. Jackman, agreed. He called the figures so far this year still quite consistent with the consensus forecast at the end of 1988 that 1989 inflation would rise to the 4.5 to 5 percent range, from 4.4 percent for both 1987 and 1988. **********The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that inflation ''appears to be holding in the 5 percent range'' and this should help calm the fearful. **********Not all analysts, however, took much comfort from the February reading. Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International, said, ''It wasn't as bad as people thought, but it still wasn't good news.'' **********Specialists also suggested that the March price index could be significantly higher because of the producer price increases, the introduction of new spring clothing lines and higher prices for gasoline. In the case of apparel, the price increases are expected to be greater than the seasonal adjustment factor. With gasoline, the seasonal pattern is for a March decline, thereby magnifying increases that are expected at the pump this year. **********In general, price increases at the producer level are transmitted to the consumer but this process is somewhat haphazard and operates with significant time lags. Thus, by the time the effects might be felt, they could be offset by other factors, like a general slowing of the economy. **********In explaining his concerns, Mr. Brusca said that ''classical'' inflationary conditions had emerged in the economy, including constraints on industrial capacity and the labor market, and he added that he was distressed that the Bush Administration seemed unwilling to acknowledge this. Five Better, One Worse **********Today's report showed that, of the seven major price index categories, five performed better in February than in January, while only one did worse and one was unchanged. **********Nearly all the moderation in February from January's inflation rate came about through smaller rises in the price of food, tobacco, entertainment services and energy, combined with a drop in the price of men's apparel, the Labor Department said. **********It was the heavily weighted housing sector - accounting for 42 percent of the index - that showed quickened inflation. But the rise was only to three-tenths of 1 percent, from two-tenths of 1 percent, and was caused in significant measure by higher prices for hotel and motel rooms. The seventh category, medical care, was unchanged, rising the same eight-tenths of 1 percent in both months. A Broad Deceleration **********The index for food and beverages climbed five-tenths of 1 percent last month, compared with seven-tenths in January, with a price slowdown for meats, poultry, fish and eggs accounting for more than 85 percent of the broad deceleration. Beef and pork prices, each of which increased 1.2 percent in January, rose less than half as much last month amid indications that the long-awaited price surge resulting from last summer's drought may not be as severe as earlier predicted. **********A decline in the price of processed fruits and vegetables that suggested the drought's effects on them may be over was partly offset by increases for fresh produce. **********The transportation index climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent paced by a 1.7 percent increase for gasoline and a 1.4 percent increase in automobile finance charges. **********Medical care inflation included a 1.1 percent jump in the costs of hospital and related services while in entertainment there was a rise of nine-tenths of 1 percent in admission charges for movies, theaters and musical and sporting events. **********Before rounding, the price index covering all urban consumers rose 0.4118616 percent in February, a rate that if maintained and compounded over a 12-month period would produce an annual inflation rate of 5.1 percent. On this basis, the rate for the first two months of 1989 is 6.1 percent. **********Prices of commodities rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, compared with seven-tenths in January, while services rose five-tenths, compared with four-tenths, the Labor Department said. **********Among the five major metropolitan areas for which price data are compiled monthly, Los Angeles posted a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent with Chicago climbing six-tenths and New York five-tenths.

''The mood at the Paris meeting over the weekend was very pro-NATO. This kind of remark is all people like the Belgians and the Danes need to start demanding big reductions in NATO spending.'' **********A NATO diplomat in Brussels said Mr. Cheney's statement had also caused surprise at the alliance's headquarters there, although he said that the Secretary of Defense had apparently made clear that reductions in American military spending would be spread worldwide, not concentrated on forces in Western Europe. **********A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense added, ''Our general view is that these things are being discussed in the negotiations in Vienna and through NATO, and that if there are any reductions on our part, they'll follow that discussion.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher, who believes that it is unwise for Western countries to begin disarming until it is clear that economic change and democratization are going to succeed in the Soviet bloc, plans to travel to Washington to see President Bush on Friday at Camp David.

Gorbachev, in Malta on Dec. 2 and 3. **********''At the Paris meeting we all agreed that Eastern Europe had come this far because we had all been following the right policy, firmness,'' a British official said. More Aid Likely **********He reported that the consensus at the weekend talks in Paris made it likely that the next European Community summit meeting, scheduled for Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9, will decide on a larger aid package for Poland and Hungary than the $330 million the community's executive commission recommended in September. The American Congress has approved $852 million for Poland and $86 million for Hungary over the next three years, and West Germany alone has agreed to provide about $1.5 billion in export guarantees and loans to Poland. **********British officials, in particular, fear that the postwar Western consensus on the need for a strong defense against the Soviet threat could unravel in West Germany if East Germany evolves into a Western-style democracy. **********The bulk of the 317,000 American troops in Europe are stationed in West Germany, and a large part of the 555,000-strong Soviet forces in Eastern Europe are based in East Germany. NATO has proposed a negotiated reduction to 275,000 each for the United States and the Soviet Union. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized West Germany's commitment to the European Community and to the Western alliance at last weekend's meeting, which President Francois Mitterrand of France called after East Germany opened its Western border for all of its 16.7 million citizens. **********''I don't know why he made such a song and dance about it,'' one of the British officials present said. ''Nobody really thought the Germans were about to leave.'' But Mr. Kohl said late Saturday after he emerged from Elysee Palace: ''The world has changed. It's a great hour for Germans, and we felt that here.'' **********American arms control specialists have been saying for weeks that success in the Vienna negotiations is bound to lead to further, non-negotiated reductions by the United States and other Western countries, in response to budget as well as political pressures. **********They fear that NATO could then become fragmented by recriminations like those that distracted the alliance last spring, when Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush wanted Mr. Kohl to agree to let the United States modernize its short-range nuclear rockets in West Germany after the intermediate-range missiles are withdrawn next year.

It has been highly beneficial to both countries and since the mid-1970's has encouraged the de facto reintegration of France into North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defense plans, Richard H. Ullman wrote in an article for the summer issue of Foreign Policy magazine. The French withdrew from the NATO defense arrangement in 1966. **********The agreement to share secret nuclear information with France was instituted more than 15 years ago by President Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, who was also Secretary of State, and has been endorsed and approved by every President since, Mr. Ullman said. He added that it was followed with special vigor during the Carter Administration. **********Mr. Ullman, who is the David K. E. Bruce Professor of International Affairs at Princeton University, worked on the policy planning staff in the Defense Department and the National Security Council in the 1960's, and has also been an editorial writer for The New York Times.  Playing '20 Questions' To Inform the French **********A technique known as ''negative guidance,'' sometimes called ''20 questions,'' was used to circumvent American law forbidding the transfer of restricted nuclear data to France. In many years of what is described as perhaps the best-kept secret in recent Washington history, United States scientists were permitted to listen to French descriptions of that country's research programs and give guidance as to whether the French were on the right track, the article said. **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today in Rome, where he is traveling with President Bush, that the secret arrangement between the United States and France was ''entirely consistent'' with the laws of both nations. **********When asked to comment on the Ullman article, a Pentagon spokeman, Lieut. Col. Keith Schneider, confirmed some aspects of it, saying the data exchange was consistent with existing agreements and not illegal. **********There have been several meetings involving American and French technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of a 1961 agreement on nuclear cooperation, Colonel Schneider said. In 1985, that 1961 agreement was ammended to encompass other forms of cooperation. **********''What we are talking about is a 1985 amendment to a 1961 agreement,'' he said. ''The 1961 agreement between the United States and France provides for exchange of classified information on military planning and protection against nuclear weapons affects and the operation of delivery systems. **********''France withdrew from NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. Following that, exchanges of unclassified nuclear information were resumed in 1972. They were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of technologies in order to enhance our mutual understanding of nuclear safety and measures to deal with nuclear weapons accidents.'' **********The United States did not furnish actual designs or pieces of equipment, which would have been a clear violation of the law, but the exchanges of data between scientists had been so unrestrained, one official said, that officials sometimes worried about how much information had been given. **********The secrecy was much less important to the United States than it was to French politicians, who did not want to violate the Gaullist doctrine of French military independence from the United States and the public illusion that the French nuclear striking force was entirely home grown, Mr. Ullman said.  A Step-Saving Road To Nuclear Weapons **********The guidance probably saved France great expenditures and effort by steering it away from research paths that the more mature United States nuclear weapons program had already found flawed. Mr. Ullman said it also probably permitted the French to develop independently targetable multiple warheads - the basis of modern nuclear striking power - much sooner than would have been the case othewise. **********In turn, the article said, French Presidents and generals had agreed to coordinate target plans for their nuclear warheads much more closely with United States plans. But the French did not forego a city-killing target plan that it would use against the Soviet Union in case the United States refuses to use nuclear weapons to forestall an invasion of France. **********According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the French now have 96 multiple warhead nuclear missiles on six submarines, and 18 ballistic missiles capable of reaching the Soviet Union in ground silos. They also have 18 long-range Mirage bombers and 38 navy planes that could carry nuclear weapons to some targets. The army has 32 shorter-range surface-to-surface missiles. The French nuclear forces, like those of Britain, were not covered by the 1987 American-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.  Keeping a Secret: 'A 1,000-Piece Puzzle' **********The French-American cooperation agreement has been of less significance in recent years as the French weapons research program has developed and become less dependent on outside assistance, Mr. Ullman said. **********Any taint of illegality may have been erased in 1985 when the United States and France negotiated a new executive agreement that permits sharing of restricted nuclear data. Pentagon officials told Mr. Ullman that the agreement was submitted to Congress, but Mr. Ullman said it was not clear that key figures on Capitol Hill had been aware of it or grasped its significance. **********Mr. Ullman said his article was based on over 100 interviews in two years here and in France with former and present offcials, including many in ''the most sensitive positions.'' All declined to permit the use of their names. **********An assistant to Mr. Kissinger said he was unable to comment on the article. Some high former officials were unavailable or declined to comment, but several seemed at least slightly shocked at the revelation. ''I can't possibly comment,'' one said. Another said ''this involved several administrations.'' Still another said, ''I knew only a few pieces of a 1,000-piece puzzle.'' The remarks seemed to confirm Mr. Ullman's contention that the secret had been tightly held. The officials did not deny his account. **********A former Nixon Administration official, asked to comment on the article, said, ''People usually leak things to get them stopped. I don't think anyone thought this program should or would be stopped.'' **********The decision in 1974 by President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger was a watershed in United States-French relations. Previously Congress and Presidents had believed that a ''third decision-making power'' on the use of nuclear weapons was dangerous. **********The Nixon team, Mr. Ullman said, decided that the arrangement was beneficial because it would increase uncertainty in the Soviet Union about a calamatious response to military agression. Moreover, he wrote, it appeared that nothing could dissuade the French from achieving independent nuclear status. **********France had already exploded a fission weapon in 1960 and a fusion weapon in 1968, years before the agreement went into effect. But refinements needed for an effective force apparently did grow out of it, the article said. **********Mr. Ullman wrote, for instance, that ''The French sought and received advice on miniaturizing their warheads,'' which is necessary for independently targtetable mulitiple warheads, ''and on shielding them from electomagnetic radiation generated by nearby nuclear explosions.'' Information on missile design and how to conduct underground tests was also passed on, he said. The transfer of that kind of data was not prohibited by law. **********Moreover, the article said, ''the United States has made available intelligence data on Soviet targets and how they are defended,'' which could keep the French deterrent viable.  Extent of Cooperation Was Largely Unknown **********The fruits of the United States initiative have been many, Mr. Ullman suggested, leading to a diplomatic intimacy not much understood outside the highest American and French circles. **********He said that military cooperation between the once estranged partners was ''extraordinary'' in part because ''its full extent is unknown not only to the publics and to nearly all the elected politicians of the various countries involved but also to the most senior - let alone junior - civilian political-military bureaucrats in their foreign and defense ministries.'' **********Mr. Ullman wrote that officials of both countries saw the political significance of the arrangement as even greater than its military value. During the Carter Administration, for example, David Aaron, the deputy national security adviser, regularly traveled to Paris for consultations with French officials on a range of security issues. **********In early 1981, when the Reagan Administration took office in the United States and Francois Mitterrand took over the French presidency from Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Mr. Ullman wrote, the American Ambassador, Arthur Hartman, assured Mr. Mitterrand that Washington wanted the nuclear relationship to continue. To the French leader, according to the article, this was an important indication that the United States would treat his Socialist Government as it had its conservative predecessors. **********Neither Mr. Aaron nor Mr. Hartman was available for comment. **********French Role in NATO: A New Monkey Wrench? **********According to Mr. Ullman, secret but intense joint military planning has induced France to immediately make available its sea and airports, railroads and pipelines in case of war and to move its forces into central Germany where, according to an American officer, ''they are going to be in the chain of command'' of the Atlantic alliance for practical purposes, despite professed French independence. **********This is significant because, despite American complaints about Soviet bloc military superiority, the Western alliance with France included has more men under arms than the Warsaw Pact, he said. A good deal of this was already known, but Mr. Ullman provides new detail. **********In the early 1980's, Mr. Ullman wrote, ''Operational coordination of French tactical air forces and NATO air forces in Central Europe became considerably tighter. Selected French airfields were earmarked and surveyed to serve as potential dispersion bases for NATO's airborne early warning system.'' **********Despite the advantages that he believes grew out of the agreement, Mr. Ullman wrote that ''it is a narrow question whether American policymakers were justified'' in their decision. ''It seems clear that the U.S.-French nuclear program contravened the spirit of the Atomic Energy Act,'' he said, and suggested elsewhere that the letter of the law had also been violated. **********Possible drawbacks are that the agreement could complicate Soviet-American arms talks and that West Germany may feel that the United States was never sincere about its professed policies on nuclear proliferation. **********Mr. Ullman suggested that it was time to make the covert cooperation overt, saying even French politicians sensitive to nationalist sentiments and Gaullist theory had little to lose now by doing so. ---- French Have No Comment PARIS, May 27 - French officials had no comment on Mr. Ullman's article until they had a chance to read it, but they stressed that France remained committed to its position as a member of NATO autonomous of the alliance's integrated command. **********In recent years, there have been numerous signs of what some diplomats call ''France's de facto integration'' in NATO. **********American commanders have privately said they have no doubt that France would participate from the first hour in the case of a Warsaw Pact assault on Western Europe. President Mitterrand and other French leaders have made it clear that they would regard any attack on West Germany to be an attack on France. **********Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said Mr. Ullman's revelations might not have a big impact in France because ''the French have become a lot more relaxed about these things than they used to be.'' **********''If you have an independent nuclear force you can decide to use it in various ways,'' said Mr. Heisbourg, who is French. ''If you're truly independent, you can have a dialogue and you can have contingency planning that covers the whole spectrum of possbilities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/03/business/key-rates-815889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/28/business/savings-and-loans-that-prosper.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1989-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Savings and Loans That Prosper", "print_headline": "Savings and Loans That Prosper", "body_text": " **********Even as Congress considers a rescue package for the beleaguered savings and loan industry that the Bush Administration estimates could eventually cost $157 billion, more than 80 percent of the 3,100 savings and loan companies are solvent and about half of them are considered in the best of health. **********The strongest of those are thriving with a variety of strategies, ranging from the traditional, like mortgage lending, to the more complex and controversial, like ''junk bonds.'' **********Consider four of the most profitable institutions in Southern California, the biggest savings and loan market in the nation. Each is publicly held. **********At one end of the spectrum is Home Savings of America, the main subsidiary of H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles. Home Savings, the nation's largest savings institution, sticks almost exclusively to gathering deposits through its branches and making adjustable-rate mortgages, a strategy as conservative as any in the business. **********Like Home Savings, the Great Western Financial Corporation is a traditional mortgage lender. But Great Western, based in Beverly Hills, has diversified into consumer loans and credit cards, businesses more typically pursued by commercial banks. **********The Downey Savings and Loan Association of Newport Beach also considers itself a conservative institution. But it has concentrated on and prospered in a field that has proved perilous to many competitors: building small shopping centers. **********At the far end of the spectrum is the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, which has been extremely successful investing in junk bonds and other ventures that some regulators and analysts consider too risky for an institution using federally insured deposits. **********The continued success of the healthiest institutions illustrates the inherent potential for profit in the business and the allure of the savings industry to some of the nation's smartest investors. **********''I can't say it's a simple business anymore,'' said Preston Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ''But it is still a considerable opportunity if you can keep costs down and manage the interest-rate volatility.'' Mr. Martin is a member of a group led by William E. Simon, the former Treasury Secretary, that has acquired a number of failed and healthy savings institutions in California and Hawaii. **********While they support efforts to clean up the industry, Home Savings, Great Western, Downey and Columbia are concerned about the Bush Administration's plan. **********Home Savings, in a blunt signal of its opposition to the Administration's proposal that savings and loan institutions should continue to pay far more than banks for deposit insurance, applied on Friday to leave the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits at commercial and savings banks. Great Western, which has long expressed the same concern, made a similar application last fall. **********Both Home Savings and Great Western are also upset at being asked to pay a large portion of the costs of cleaning up ''problems we did not create'' arising from deregulation policies ''we strongly opposed,'' as Richard H. Deihl, the chairman of Home Savings and its parent company, put it last week. **********Home Savings and Great Western are expected to face long battles over their requests since the Administration's bailout plan depends heavily on income from the deposit premiums paid by savings and loan institutions. More than 1,200 savings and loans could meet the requirements for F.D.I.C. insurance. **********Columbia and, to a lesser extent, Downey, are worried that the savings crisis could lead Congress to restrict some of the investment powers granted under deregulation. **********''It would be a shame and an overreaction to the troubles of the thrift industry to begin reregulating the financial services industry,'' said Lawrence K. Fish, the president of Columbia Savings. Home Savings: Minimum Risk Home Savings has been one of the most aggressive institutions in the industry in switching from fixed-rate mortgages, the standard until the early 1980's, to adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages have been the most important factor in reducing the vulnerability to rising interest rates. **********At the end of 1988, 88 percent of the mortgages in Home Savings' portfolio were adjustable rate, one of the highest percentages in the industry. The percentage would have been higher except for the company's acquisition last year of the Bowery Savings Bank of New York. Home Savings, with assets of more than $39 billion, earned $202 million in 1988. **********Home Savings is also unusual for its almost exclusive reliance for funds on its network of 352 branches in California and eight other states. About 95 percent of its $29.6 billion in deposits at the end of 1988 was made up of retail deposits, a third of it in passbook, checking and money market accounts carrying interest rates of 5.5 percent or less. **********Because of its strong retail deposit base, Home Savings does not have to borrow money at relatively high interest rates or compete for large certificates of deposit, which typically carry premium interest rates. **********Gerald S. Haims, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, called Home Savings the top loan-origination network. ''They turn out adjustable-rate mortgages like Lever Brothers turns out soap,'' he said. ''They've maintained excellent quality control and they've basically stayed out of other areas.'' Great Western: Diversified With nearly $33 billion in assets, Great Western is the nation's third-largest savings institution and Home Savings' major competitor in California. Great Western, which had profit of $248 million in 1988, also considers the adjustable-rate mortgage its main business. But Mr. Haims said the two are increasingly dissimilar. **********While Home Savings sticks to adjustable mortgages, Great Western's diversification into consumer loans, credit cards and other financial services not traditionally offered by savings and loans makes its operations look more and more like a commercial bank, Mr. Haims said. **********James F. Montgomery, Great Western's chairman and chief executive, said the institution had rejected most of the other diversification avenues opened by deregulation. **********For example, during 1983, the company formed a commercial loan group to explore lending to small businesses. Mr. Montgomery decided to shut the operation down before it made its first loan. **********''We don't know a whole lot about commercial lending, and some of these other things didn't make a whole lot of sense to us,'' Mr. Montgomery said. **********One of Great Western's tactics was to build its capital. It already meets the stricter capital rules proposed by the Bush Administration. **********Great Western's basic strategy is to be ''a real estate-oriented consumer bank,'' Mr. Montgomery said. **********Consumer loans and credit cards, which analysts said account for 15 to 20 percent of Great Western's lending, fit into the ''retail family level'' that Great Western is comfortable with, Mr. Montgomery said. Downey Savings: Specialized Loans Downey Savings is not only far smaller than Home Savings or Great Western, with $4.3 billion in assets, but it also considers itself as much a real estate developer as a mortgage lender. Founded in 1957 with $330,000 in capital, it has more than $200 million in capital. Maurice McAlister, Downey's president and one of its founders, said that about 40 percent of the increase in capital came from profits on development projects. Its 1988 profit was $28.9 million. **********Direct investment in real estate has always been risky for savings institutions. But Mr. McAlister said that by sticking to its specialty of small shopping centers, Downey has avoided serious problems. He said the company's strategy was not to go ahead with a project until it has enough tenants to insure success. **********In mortgage lending, he said, Downey protects itself by making loans, mostly adjustable, only on single-family houses selling for less than $350,000, a strategy that has kept defaults low. Columbia Savings: Strong Profits Columbia Savings, with assets of $12.7 billion, may be best known for the salary of its chairman, Thomas Spielgel - $5.4 million in 1987 - whose family controls the institution. With its large portfolio of junk bonds and mortgage-backed securities, Columbia also is one of the nation's least traditional savings and loans. **********The nature of its investments has always drawn criticism from regulators and analysts who think that Columbia should not be speculating on junk bonds and other securities with deposits that the Government and ultimately the taxpayer are insuring. At the same time, however, Columbia has a strong record of profitability that its critics cannot argue with. **********''I'll grant that Columbia has done very well,'' Mr. Haims of Seidler Amdec said. ''But the critical question is whether you regard the institution as a thrift and whether the Government should back the institution in the same way it does Ahmanson or a small well-run institution.'' Columbia had profit of $65 million in 1988. **********After a long review of its operations, Columbia has decided to continue pursuing its current business, including junk-bond investing, Mr. Fish, its president, said. The company is also adding nontraditional businesses. Drawing on its investment prowess, it wants to do more money management.And earlier this month it announced that it was forming a corporate finance division. **********At the same time, though, Columbia wants to invest in its traditional retail branch business. ''We found that we have a highly profitable foundation of thrift activity that we can build on to enhance the core earnings of the corporation,'' Mr. Fish said.

The report said representatives of the two sides held a ''working meeting'' in Warsaw today to discuss the preliminary results of the vote. Solidarity 92, Warsaw 8 **********The Communist Party and its allies apparently failed to obtain any of the 299 seats guaranteed to them in the races for positions in the lower house of Parliament, or Assembly. Those seats will be decided in a run-off election on June 18. Many of the nearly 2,000 Communist candidates recieved less than 10 percent of the vote as Poles chose to cross their names off the ballots. **********By contrast, Solidarity won 92 of the 100 seats to the upper house of Parliament, known as the Senate, and 160 of the 161 seats that the union movement was allowed to compete for in the lower house under the terms of the intricate voting process. **********Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, said in Warsaw today that the union was prepared to cooperate with the Government ''on an issue-by-issue basis,'' although he repeated a formula used on Monday in saying that the union would refuse to send its ministers into a Communist-led government, because that would be in effect to join a coalition. A Full-Fledged Opposition **********In Gdansk, the Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, said, ''We did not fight for chairs for ourselves, or a change of Government, or a fight with the Government.'' **********A substantial majority of Solidarity candidates won seats in the two-chamber Parliament, planting the seeds for the first full-fledged political opposition in the Soviet bloc. But if there was much public enthusiasm for the victory, it was not widely evident today. **********Knots of people continued to gather in front of the large windows of Solidarity's Warsaw headquarters, in Constitution Square, and women wept silently as returns were posted at regular intervals under large black and white photos of the candidates. But there were no victory parties and no public rejoicing as the union movement appeared to savor the victory quietly. **********Speaking at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk, Mr. Walesa said the union was prepared to cooperate with the incumbent Government to bring abgout change. ''We fought for a different system of wielding power in this country,'' he said. ''Therefore we cannot replace this Government, or we will become just like this Government. What we want is to conduct changes together with this Government.'' Faced with a humiliating popular rebuke in the freest elections that the Communists have permitted since 1947, the party leadership on Monday appealed to Solidarity to join a grand coalition to govern Poland. **********Bronislaw Geremek, Mr. Walesa's senior adviser, said the union's leadership did not understand this to mean sending ministers into the Government but simply to join a ''union of social forces'' with the Government to seek solutions to Poland's pressing problems, notably the convulsed economy. 'We Are Ready' **********''As far as the second alternative, we are ready,'' he said at a news conference in the foyer of the Grand Theater in Warsaw. ''As for the first, we are not prepared at this moment.'' **********Election officials do not expect a full list of results before Wednesday, but results trickling in from scattered polling places and published by Solidarity and the Government appear to confirm the breadth of Solidarity's victory. **********One runoff will pit the Solidarity candidate in Bydgoszcz, Aleksandr Paszynski, a former journalist and private building contractor, against the Communist candidate, Jan Glemp, the brother of Poland's Roman Catholic Primate, Jozef Cardinal Glemp. **********But the immediate problem facing Solidarity and the Government appeared to be a what to do about 35 unopposed candidates, including many of the Communist Party's top leaders, who failed to clear a 50 percent hurdle needed for them to enter Parliament. Pledge of Adherence **********The nominees include the Prime Minister, Mieczyslaw Rakowski, as well as the incumbents in the ministries of defense and internal affairs, responsible for the army and the police. **********At his news conference, Mr. Geremek pledged Solidarity's adherence to the accords with the Government that set aside 65 percent of the lower house of Parliament for the Communist-led bloc. ''How to fill up the remaining seats of Parliament is an affair of the coalition,'' he said, using the term reserved for describing the Communists and their allies in Government. **********But other Solidarity advisers made it clear that they expected the party leadership to present its proposal for resolving the issue to Solidarity for prior approval, particularly in the light of the union movement's vast victory. It appeared likely that the union would demand a political price for approval of any Government plan to get top Communist leaders into Parliament. What of Prime Minister?  Some senior advisers suggested that the union might demand significant changes within the Council of Ministers, or day-to-day Government, including perhaps the dismissal of the Prime Minister, Mr. Rakowski. **********For its part, the Government, in its public pronouncements, after conceding Solidarity's overwhelming victory in a statement on Monday, appeared to be at pains to play down the significance of the vote. **********Chosen to deliver this messge was the Government's acting spokesman, Zbyslaw Rykowski, who said that while the Government would conduct an analysis of the final results once they were made available, the results of individual voting decisions already available appeared to have been directed by ''emotion and reactions.'' **********At the Government's weekly news conference, Mr. Rykowski said: ''The question remains open whether the sum of these individual decisions is an expression of the real collective will of society. I think not.'' **********His remarks were met with peals of laughter from Polish and other reporters assembled for the news conference.  BUSH APPLAUDS RESULTS **********WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) -President Bush applauded Poland's elections today, saying the Polish people deserved American support, and the State Department hailed the Communist Party for statesmanlike behavior in conceding defeat. **********''Sunday's elections in Poland marked an important step toward freedom and democracy,'' Mr. Bush. ''I am encouraged by the responses of both the Polish Government and members of the opposition to the election results. The Polish people are now taking steps that deserve our active support.'' **********The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said: ''Yesterday's concession by the Polish Communist Party was statesmanlike and commendable. We welcome the reaffirmation of the party's spokesman that the Polish Government will continue democratic and economic reforms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/29/business/money-fund-assets-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "body_text": " **********The assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual funds increased by $191.6 million, to $349.23 billion, for the week that ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

Sales have been hurt by higher prices, as well as by changes in the tax laws and increased competition from American and Japanese luxury cars. **********But sales of European luxury cars seem to be suffering from something more subtle than their steep pricing. An Emotional Decision **********''Buying a car for more than $10,000 or $15,000 is a decision that has a certain amount of emotion in it,'' a spokesman for BMW said. ''Have our cars ceased to be status symbols? It's a serious question.'' **********Robert Sinclair, president of Saab's import arm in the United States, said many Americans have come to regard ostentatious displays of wealth and lavish spending as socially irresponsible. **********''It's the change from the me-too yuppie era,'' he said. ''People are seeking more traditional values.'' **********Mr. Sinclair delivered this appraisal to Saab directors in October; they had come to New York to discuss why American sales of the Swedish luxury car had dropped to 38,490 cars in 1988, from 48,086 in 1986. During that period, the price of Saab's least expensive car rose to $17,000, from $12,300, while the most expensive model soared to $32,100, from $23,700. **********Making generalizations about buyer psychology is a tricky business. But market researchers have found evidence of a shift in attitude. ''Luxury cars are still a symbol of success, but the consumer is becoming much more pragmatic,'' said Sandy Hoffman, senior vice president of the Roper Group. ''The focus on self, while still there, is muted.'' **********The Daniel Yankelovich Group, which surveys public opinion, found last year that ''the crash of 1987 was a psychological watershed for affluent buyers, as well as a group we call the young aspirers,'' said David Meer, senior vice president. **********Among households with annual incomes of $100,000 or more, ''a sense of caution and limits has entered their thinking,'' Mr. Meer said. Concern with the environment, Government budget deficits and social issues like homelessness was also more evident than in the previous two years. **********''I don't think people are backing away from buying Jaguars because they're concerned about the ozone layer,'' he said. ''It's not cause and effect. But I think both things - the worry and the decision not to buy -spring from the same underlying feeling, that we can't have everything.'' Style and Substance **********Until 1987, European makers of luxury cars had consistently been able to charge premium prices and increase sales for two reasons: substance and style. European cars had a quality and performance advantage over most American-made vehicles. **********The European auto makers also attempted to reinforce their sophisticated, high-class image by advertising and promotion that often focused on status. Aston Martin of Britain, for example, ran an advertisement that read ''Demoralize Thy Neighbor.'' **********''That ad epitomized the 1980's, Wall Street, go-for-it mentality,'' Mr. Meer said. **********''Getting wealth and flaunting it doesn't feel quite as good as the society changes,'' he said. ''Obviously, George Bush's people do research as well, and that's why they talk about a kinder, gentler nation. Those words struck a responsive chord because that's what is on people's minds.'' Narrowing the Quality Gap **********A crucial aspect of European luxury-car marketing has been the message that it is intelligent and acceptable behavior to reward oneself by spending an enormous sum on a car. Such behavior made sense, in the logic of the marketers, because the buyer was getting a superior-quality vehicle. **********Throughout the 1980's, however, domestic auto makers have narrowed the gap in quality and performance, eroding the extra value that luxury buyers perceived they were getting for the premium prices. **********''We've had three to four years of pretty good news from the U.S. car makers, and the public is starting to find out,'' said David E. Davis, publisher of Automobile magazine. ''We're seeing the convergence of two important trend lines: rising import prices and growing improvement by the domestics. There had to be a point where they crossed.'' **********Moreover, the 1986 overhaul in the Federal income tax laws increased the cost of owning a luxury car. The deductibility of most interest payments was phased out and the use of investment tax credits was curtailed. That meant lawyers, doctors and brokers who once deducted their cars as a business expense were forced to make more practical choices. **********The decline of the dollar's value against the West German mark, the Swedish krona and other European currencies has only accelerated the price increases that luxury-car makers had begun about two years ago. Many executives in the luxury-car import business are now convinced that prices have risen so high - and competing American vehicles have so markedly improved - that buyers no longer believe the extra value in a European luxury car justifies the premium price. **********''You don't really know where the price versus value threshold is until you've crossed it,'' said Brian Bowler, president of Porsche Cars of North America. ''And we crossed it.'' While the price of some Porsche models has jumped sharply, the number of cars brought into this country has dropped by half since 1986, to 15,737, from 30,471. 'That's Crazy' **********One Porsche dealer, who asked not to be identified, quoted a customer as saying: ''I'm willing to pay $40,000 for a Porsche 911, but $55,000? That's crazy.'' **********Joseph Herman, who is a partner in 22 auto dealerships, most of them selling European luxury cars, said a buyer who agrees to buy a car that others think is too highly priced fails to achieve the image for which he or she is searching. **********''The problem is that a person who spends too much money on a car that doesn't have sufficient value is perceived by his friends to be a fool,'' Mr. Herman said. **********The fool was once considered by many to be the buyer of an American car, but not any longer. ''The bottom line is you can show up now driving one of the better American cars and not suffer any social stigma,'' Mr. Davis said. **********As demand for European luxury cars has declined, widespread dealer discounting has ensued, enabling some buyers to buy luxury cars for thousands of dollars less than the sticker price. This discounting has upset manufacturers, who think it cuts into their carefully cultivated luxury images. **********In response to this sales erosion, most European auto companies are freezing or reducing prices, offering rebates disguised as free optional equipment or, in the case of Mercedes, providing a free flight to Europe to pick up the car. Competing With Second Homes **********A. B. Shuman, a spokesman for Mercedes-Benz, disputed the notion that affluent consumers are backing away from expensive European cars. But he said the most expensive Mercedes, which costs about $80,000, may now be vying with ''non-automotive competitors,'' like boats and second homes. **********Nevertheless, to make Mercedes more affordable and more enticing, the company has lowered the price of its entry-level 190 series and put a bigger engine in those cars. **********Sales of Audi cars have been hurt by complaints that some of its models had an unintended acceleration problem. Audi has rebutted the complaints, which have not been substantiated, and the company said it was about to start a major television advertising campaign billing itself as ''technological leader of the European luxury imports.'' **********At Jaguar, Michael Dale, senior vice president of sales and marketing, said the company realized in 1987 that it had overpriced its cars when its sales fell. **********''It's quite easy to see that customers will pay $20,000 for the difference between a Jaguar and a Cadillac, but we were charging $30,000'' more than Cadillac, he said. **********Jaguar has reduced some prices, and it has also limited the number of cars sent to the United States to maintain an air of exclusivity. Porsche's Moves **********Porsche has frozen prices for the rest of the year, dropped the lower-priced 924 model and, to improve the value-to-price relationship, added a more powerful engine in the 944 and a new suspension in the 911. **********Mr. Sinclair is convinced that Saab is poised to take advantage of ''instability'' in the European luxury segment by positioning its cars as ''solid, dependable, safe transportation.'' **********For good measure, Saab will also criticize German and Japanese competitors in a series of ads that will appear next month. **********All of these moves might be too little, too late: Toyota, Nissan and Honda have been moving into the luxury field with cars that have won praise from critics. The Japanese luxury cars offer styling and power similar to the European models but generally at lower prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/business/north-africa-pipeline.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "North Africa Pipeline", "print_headline": "North Africa Pipeline", "body_text": " **********King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria agreed on Wednesday to build a gas pipeline across North Africa to Europe, symbolizing a new era of cooperation between the former rivals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/13/business/real-estate-a-jukebox-hotel-for-times-square.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 944, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; A 'Jukebox' Hotel for Times Square", "print_headline": "Real Estate; A 'Jukebox' Hotel for Times Square", "body_text": " **********A $300 MILLION hotel designed to look and light up like a giant jukebox has just opened in Times Square, where the idea for the building first took root in the mind of its architect almost 50 years ago. **********The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza-Manhattan, a 46-story hotel on the west side of Broadway between 48th and 49th Streets, is the second major hotel project to go up in the area in four years, while two others are under construction and two more are being planned. **********The 770-room hotel is the flagship of the 25-unit Crowne Plaza chain, a division of the Holiday Corporation, which founded Holiday Inns. **********The new hotel certainly is different, in a pattern that some American architects are calling the Wurlitzer look. **********''The Wurlitzer Company designed a jukebox that imitated the design of the buildings that went up around Times Square in the 1930's and 1940's, and now I'm imitating Wurlitzer,'' said Alan Lapidus, the architect of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza-Manhattan. **********A graduate of and a former teacher at Columbia University's School of Architecture, Mr. Lapidus said, ''I grew up in Brooklyn, and it used to be a big thing for me as a little boy to come into Times Square at night, step out of the subway at 42d Street and be visually overwhelmed by the art moderne buildings and their lights, and my design seeks to re-create my reminiscences of that time.'' **********And the concept may be gathering momentum: Another hotel in the Wurlitzer style owned by the Marriott Corporation opened in San Francisco in October. **********''I think people long for the good old days when buildings made us smile, so I deliberately chose to use pink and burgundy on the outside of the Crowne Plaza as a happy way of inviting people to come inside,'' Mr. Lapidus added. **********Responding to design mandates of the City Planning Commission for the area, and with the image of the Times Square glitz of years ago in mind, he ringed the facade with giant banks of multicolored lights, a promotion that will cost more than $100,000 a year to maintain and operate, said Michael Silberstein, the new hotel's managing director. **********Mr. Silberstein said that the property had already begun to attract business travelers and tourists, even before its opening on Dec. 1, and that 12 hours after opening ''we had 129 reservations for New Year's Eve without advertising.'' **********Mr. Silberstein said his marketing strategy was to attract a mix of business executives coming to the new office space being developed in midtown, people attending conventions and tourists. The regular room rates are about $202 for the smallest single, and $228 for the smallest double. **********''When all the six hotel projects in Times Square are finished, there will be more than 4,000 new rooms and 300,000 square feet of exhibit space, enough to accommodate large conventions, and that is going to benefit all the new hotels,'' he said. The first to go up in 1985 was the Marriott Marquis, an 1,874-room hotel at Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets. **********Two other hotels are to open next year: the 460-unit Embassy Suites atop the old Palace Theater at the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 47th Street, and the 638-room Hotel Macklowe at 145 West 44th Street. The two in the planning stages are the 315-room Ramada Renaissance, which in 1991 would occupy the block bounded by Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 47th and 48th Streets, and the 324-room Hampton Inn, a franchise hotel, which would open in 1992 on the south side of 50th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. **********''In addition to conventions, we want to attract the business traveler who is headed for the new office buildings going up in the area, and we hope about one-third of our clientele will be foreign tourists,'' Mr. Silberstein added, pointing out that his hotel was designed to take advantage of the Holiday Inn's central Holidex reservation system. **********William Zeckendorf Jr., who is a major partner in the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, said at the time the project was announced four years ago that the investors hoped to take advantage of the international reservations system of the Holiday Corporation. The Memphis firm is the corporate parent of Holiday Inns, Embassy Suites and Hampton Inns. **********Next month, however, Bass P.L.C., a British holding company, will assume control of the Crowne Plaza division, while a new corporate entity, the Promise Companies, will take over the Embassy Suites and Hampton Inns divisions. **********While the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza would be managed by the Crowne Plaza division, ownership of the new hotel is vested in a complicated network of investors and companies. **********According to documents submitted to the New York State Liquor Authority in connection with a liquor license, there are general partners, class A limited partners and class B limited partners.

On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,331.25. The markets in London, Tokyo and Frankfurt have also risen sharply this year. Financial experts are debating whether this is the beginning of a new, global bull market or just the ''January effect'' - when stock prices rise at the start of a new year. Four analysts assess the market's strength.  Gerald S. Zukowski  Manager of the Boston Company's Capital Appreciation Fund. **********I have been optimistic since November 1987 and I still am. There is less upside potential now, but the climb is not over. I think the Dow will rise above 2,400 by the end of February. I'm not so bullish for the longer term because we're in the end phase of a major rally, but that doesn't mean we'll have a tailspin either. **********There has been huge foreign buying in our stock market over the last few months. The Kraft deal was financed by foreign banks and the Pillsbury deal with English money. The R.J.R. deal has $5 billion of Japanese money in it. And if you cross out the middlemen - like K.K.R. - the effect is the same as if foreign buyers simply buy our stock. Something like $150 billion worth of stock has been retired or bought back in deals and therefore disappeared from the market during 1988. At the same time, with so much foreign money coming in and with institutions still holding cash, the supply-demand situation is very strong.  Raymond T. Dalio  President and chief executive, Bridgewater Associates. **********The situation is marginally bullish for stocks right now. There is a lot of cash on the sidelines that is now coming in. This is both positive and negative. That is because once the cash is in and pushes the market up, it can easily leave and bring down the market. **********One important indicator for the market is the slope of the yield curve. If you bought $1,000 worth of stock in 1964 and held it, it would be worth $7,400 today. But if you did the same but didn't hold that stock during periods when Treasury bill rates were above Treasury bond rates, that same $1,000 would be worth $13,100 today. So the inverted yield curve is a great indicator of when to get out of the market. Right now, the two rates are very close and are signaling caution.  Eric H. Sorensen  Director of quantitative analysis, Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Half of the upward movement for stocks this year comes from the portfolio community getting back into the market. But there was also the ''January effect'' pushing the market upward. **********Certain groups of equities look attractive, but the general market condition is not that great. Even so, value investors with good techniques will get rewarded. The overall outlook for the Standard & Poor's 500, or the Japanese Nikkei Index, favors bonds - although we favor the Japanese stock market over the United States stock market.  Martin Zweig  Chairman, the Zweig Fund. **********The rally will continue for a while and I'm moderately bullish. There is a lot of cash that institutions are holding. These institutions feel they've missed the boat, so they will play catch-up and start buying. This market is no piece of cake, however. The short-term rates are 3 percent higher than a year ago, which is why all the cash built up. **********Since the start of the year, the Japanese market has been strong and so has the British market. The whole world is going up, and when it goes up, cash comes in from the sidelines. That's why there has been a lot of institutional buying. But the buying has been narrow. Public activity is also picking up.

W. de Klerk, introduced himself today to President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a relentless critic of apartheid, on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls. **********Mr. Kaunda previously met Prime Minister John Vorster of South Africa in August 1975, not far from the spot where he received Mr. de Klerk today. He also talked with President P. W. Botha in April 1982 on the border between Botswana and South Africa. These meetings did not lead him to change his mind about the need for penalties to force South Africa to abandon apartheid. **********Mr. Kaunda is chairman of the front-line states confronting South Africa. He appeared today to back away from his interpretation last week that the Angolan peace settlement drafted at Gbadolite, Zaire, two months ago required the resignation of the Angolan guerrilla leader, Jonas Savimbi, and the integration of his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola into the structures of the Marxist Government in Luanda. Top of the Agenda **********Mr. Savimbi and his backers in South Africa contend that the Gbadolite declaration made no such demands. **********That controversy and the recent breakdown of the cease-fire in Angola constituted the foremost issue in today's talks, which were held at a resort hotel almost within earshot of the mile-wide waterfalls. **********After more than two and a half hours of discussions, President Kaunda told reporters that he would consult his fellow African leaders and leave the matter in the hands of President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, who had mediated the Gbadolite declaration. In so doing, he made Mr. Mobutu the arbiter of the declaration's intentions. De Klerk's Vision of the Future **********Mr. de Klerk emphasized the importance of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries, a polite way of telling outsiders not to meddle in South Africa's problems. But he also described in some detail his vision of evolutionary change in South Africa, in which white-minority domination would go but would not be replaced by black-majority domination. **********Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Kaunda today used words like ''useful,'' ''frank'' and ''open'' to describe their meeting at a news conference later, suggesting that little specific progress was achieved. **********President Kaunda explained that he simply wanted to meet Mr. de Klerk, who was expected to become the new leader of South Africa even before he abruptly replaced Mr. Botha two weeks ago. **********On Sunday, Mr. Kaunda, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, said he wanted to find out what Mr. de Klerk stood for and whether he was the man to bring change to South Africa. If a peaceful solution to South Africa's racial problems is not found, Mr. Kaunda said, an ''explosion'' there could result within two years. **********Mr. de Klerk, for his part, described Mr. Kaunda as ''a pleasant man'' and ''an honest Christian.'' **********Talking to reporters later in the day, the Acting President alluded to South Africa's strategy of expanding contacts with black African countries to counter the international isolation imposed as a result of Pretoria's racially discriminatory policies. Last month, Mr. de Klerk visited President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, and last Friday he flew to see President Mobutu in Zaire. **********''I would say that South Africa has successfully today used an available platform to improve relations and to clear up misunderstandings and to present the reality of South Africa in contrast to the image against which we are judged internationally, which is quite absolutely outdated,'' Mr. de Klerk said. South African Elections **********In response to another question, Mr. de Klerk denied that he had gone to Zambia to generate publicity for the governing National Party, which he heads, before parliamentary elections scheduled in nine days. **********''I really haven't undertaken this meeting with respect to the elections,'' Mr. de Klerk said. ''I undertook this trip as acting head of state in the best interests of South Africa.'' **********In fact, the trip was arranged before Mr. de Klerk became Acting President. **********President Botha complained that he had not been consulted and disapproved because Mr. Kaunda was an enemy who had given refuge to the outlawed African National Congress. In the resulting showdown, Mr. Botha was forced to resign on Aug. 14 and the Cabinet chose Mr. de Klerk to succeed him.  Angolan Rebels Report Fighting **********LISBON, Aug. 28 (Reuters) - Angolan guerrillas said today that 143 soldiers and 23 guerrillas had been killed in weekend fighting as the Government stepped up an offensive on villages and rebel bases. A statement by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola said Government attacks in Cunene and Cuando-Cubango in southern Angola had forced the rebels to counterattack."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/business/another-august-under-the-whine-sign.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1797, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another August Under the 'Whine Sign'", "print_headline": "Another August Under the 'Whine Sign'", "body_text": " **********The anguished-looking little girl in a pink dress knew exactly which one it had to be. ''David has this one,'' she declared. ''I want it.'' **********She was pointing directly at the Sesame Street lunch box at the Kiddie City store on West 34th Street in New York. Her mother, studying the piles of lunch boxes - Pee-Wee's Playhouse, Ring Raiders, Batman - was dubious. ''You don't really need one. What's wrong with Barbie?'' ''I want Big Bird,'' the girl repeated. ''David has it.'' ''All right,'' the exasperated mother said. ''But that's it. You hear me? That is undeniably, completely it!'' **********Once again, the fun of the annual buying rush for school lunch boxes has arrived. Picking the perfect box is always a tricky decision. Sure, the food will taste just as good (or wretched) in an Ed Grimley as in a Cherry Merry Muffin box, but a bad choice can have alarming consequences if you're bent on becoming the most popular person in the history of the third grade. **********''When you're a kid, it's not what you drive, it's what you carry that gives you status in the blackboard jungle,'' pointed out Scott Bruce, who refers to himself as Mr. Lunch Box because he collects old lunch boxes and publishes a quarterly newsletter for other collectors called Hot Boxing. ''Adults have their B.M.W.'s and kids have their lunch boxes.''  An August Tradition **********The school lunch box industry pretty much exists for Augusts. That's when something like 80 percent of the approximately seven million lunch boxes usually sold in America each year are bought and when parents verge on nervous breakdowns stocking up on erasers and compasses to send their offspring off to school. **********Keeping American children outfitted with receptacles for their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches essentially provides work for just two companies - the King-Seeley Thermos Company of Freeport, Ill., and Aladdin Industries of Nashville, Tenn. They refer to their products as school lunch kits. But it is difficult to live off lunch kits alone. So Thermos, which was recently bought by Nippon Sanso, also makes Thermos bottles, ice chests, gas grills and coffee carafes, while Aladdin makes hospital and airline trays, insulated bottles and kerosene lamps. **********Which company sells more lunch kits depends on the one you ask. Each estimates that it has more than 50 percent of the roughly $35 million market. Their market shares actually fluctuate, depending on such matters as whether Barbie happens to be thrashing Hollywood Mickey Mouse or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are mutilating G.I. Joe. **********The reason for this shameless name-dropping is that the lunch box industry is driven by the characters the companies license from movies, television and comic strips to decorate almost all of their boxes. **********Thermos, which makes 22 different boxes, expects its biggest seller this year to be one of two new contenders - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Batmam, closely followed by Barbie, who is always popular and finished just behind Alf last year. With 19 models, Aladdin predicts its leading seller will be the new Super Mario Brothers, based on the Nintendo video game, followed by Mickey, Sesame Street and G.I. Joe. **********The proliferation of these characters has transformed the business. In the 19th century, schoolchildren packed their lunches in their fathers' empty tobacco tins, though that was never a great idea because the tins smelled. Although the first licensed character appeared on a box in 1935 in the form of Mickey Mouse, it didn't sell all that well. **********Up through the 1940's the lunch box business was decidedly dull. About all that was available were plain red or blue enamel boxes or a plaid model made by Aladdin. And children used their boxes until they became embarrassingly dented or rusted. In the 1940's, only about 50,000 boxes were sold a year, according to Mr. Bruce, who wrote a book, ''The Fifties and Sixties Lunch Box.''  Hopalong Led the Boom **********In 1950, the chairman of Aladdin thought it might be interesting to slap a decal of Hopalong Cassidy on one of the boxes. The cowboy, after all, was everyone's hero back then. That year, some 500,000 of the Hopalong Cassidy boxes were sold. **********The lunch box boom commenced. In 1953, Thermos entered the business with a fully lithographed box with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans that sold more than a million units. Since then, just about every imaginable character - Atom Ant, Bullwinkle, Beany and Cecil, Captain Astro, Mr. T, Gumby, the Jetsons, Gomer Pyle, Howdy Doody, the Flying Nun - has graced the sides of a lunch box. **********''It's almost all character-driven now,'' said Michael Schimmel, Aladdin's director of marketing. ''Our studies show that 84 percent of the purchases are because a kid specifically wants A Pup Named Scooby or G.I. Joe and not Ghostbusters. The rest of the sales are Mom and Dad buying the cheapest box. But I'll bet you've got some unhappy kids there.'' **********What's hot in any given year is usually what's new or characters that are heavily promoted by a toy company or a television show. Evidently, it is social suicide for a youngster to show up two years in a row lugging an Alf box or toting Roger Rabbit when Batman is America's star. **********By frequently changing the motifs on their boxes, the companies pretty much ensure that children will demand a new lunch box every August. But the characters have added some expenses to the business. To obtain rights to a character, the lunch box companies typically pay a guarantee over two years of between $2,000 and $100,000, which is applied toward royalties of 7 to 10 percent. **********Competition for the characters has pushed up prices. After all, top characters, Thermos said, sell about 500,000 boxes a year, while run-of-the-mill boxes sell about 40,000. Though some boxes become classics, most are lucky to have three or four good years before fading into oblivion. **********Lunch box sales have also benefited tremendously from the post-World War II baby boom and the spread of television. Another big boost occurred in 1982, when millions of children started carrying their lunch rather than buying it at school after Congress cut subsidies for school lunch programs and tightened eligibility requirements for reduced-price and free meals. That year, the industry enjoyed its biggest season ever. Aladdin estimates that more than 12 million boxes were sold. **********Sales subsequently tapered off, hurt by the decline in births, and have been fairly flat the last few years. However, Aladdin and Thermos expect some pick-up in the future. ''There is a little boom coming up from the baby boomers having children and with more kids going to day care centers,'' said Gary Becker, senior product manager for school lunch kits at Thermos. **********Indeed, lunch box carriers are getting younger. Aladdin says its research shows that children now carry lunch boxes between the ages of 3 and 8, compared with 5 and 12 a decade ago. ''Now, if you're carrying a lunch kit after the age of 8, it's corny,'' Mr. Schimmel said. ''Kids are more mature at an earlier age now, so if you have a kid who's 7 or 8 and he knows that his younger brother who's 3 is carrying Mickey Mouse and his older brother is carrying a backpack, he's going to want to carry a backpack.'' **********Because of these developments, Aladdin has introduced several products for older children. Last year, it brought out a mini-cooler that resembles a lunch box but is bigger and has no character on it. It also sells an insulated ''unbrown bag,'' a vinyl container that looks like a brown paper bag. It is chiefly for adults, but is being bought by children who are too old for Quick Draw McGraw. **********Lunch boxes are pretty good values today. Most stores sell them at a low mark-up, or even at a loss, as a way to build customer traffic for pencils and gym shorts. The wholesale price of a lunch box is about $4.65, and stores sell them for anywhere from $3.99 to $6.99. Prices were even cheaper a few years ago, as a result of a spurt of imports from Taiwan and South America decorated with dogs and clowns. Although they sold for as little as $3, they didn't fare very well and appear to have dropped off substantially this year. **********And most lunch boxes today aremade out of injection-molded plastic. Steel boxes went by the wayside because they rusted and dented easily.The last one appeared in 1987 and featured, fittingly, Rambo.  Lunch Box Diplomacy **********Choosing a lunch boxoften involves as much diplomacy as negotiating to eliminate short-range missiles. Children and parents tend to be far apart on what is the appropriate box to be seen with. Store personnel, in fact, often refer to the lunch box display as the ''whine sign'' because of the bickering that transpires beneath it. **********The industry believes that many purchases are the result of hard-fought compromises. And these pacts can make for some surprise sellers. Thought to be the most popular lunch box ever was the Disney School Bus box (driven by Goofy), which Aladdin sold more than two million of between 1961 and 1973. Mr. Bruce believes that it did well because it was a good compromise box. **********''The kid would want the Lost in Space or Incredible Hulk box and the mother would want something nerdy like the red plaid box,'' he explained. ''So after a lot of screeching they would agree on the Disney school bus. From the kids' standpoint, it wasn't the power box, but at least it wasn't humiliating.'' **********Over time, however, parents may learn to love even the Incredible Hulk. Lunch boxes have become a desirable collectible for thousands, largely because of the efforts of Scott Bruce. About 700 people subscribe to Mr. Bruce's newsletter, including an F-16 pilot who takes his 1959 Steve Canyon lunch box with him on flights. Some boxes, such as the Beatles box or a dent-free Soupy Sales, trade among collectors for $300 to $700. **********Mr. Bruce - who likes to point out that his great-great-great uncle invented the hole in the doughnut - recently sold one-fifth of his collection of 1,500 boxes for $17,000. But after three years of collecting lunch boxes, he has grown bored. Now, he's amassing cereal boxes and starting a newsletter called Flake."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/consumer-borrowing-pace-eases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 481, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumer Borrowing Pace Eases", "print_headline": "Consumer Borrowing Pace Eases", "body_text": " **********Americans took out $2.73 billion more in consumer debt than they retired in April, a sharp slowing of the borrowing pace of earlier months, the Government reported today. **********The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit in April rose 4.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from 6.4 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February. **********April's increase was the slowest advance since a 3.5 percent gain last September and was a sharp retreat from the 8.5 percent rise in consumer debt in 1988.

In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 7/8 percent issue due 2019, were offered at 98 14/32, up 1 9/32, while the yield plunged to 9.02 percent, from 9.15 percent the day before. A week ago, it was 9.10 percent. **********Among other closely watched issues in the secondary market, the Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of 1999, soared 31/32, to 100 3/32, for a yield of 9.17 percent. The 9 5/8's of 1993 climbed 25/32, to 100 31/32, for a yield of 9.32 percent; the 9 3/4's of 1991 rose 13/32, to 100 20/32, for a yield of 9.39 percent. **********Philip Braverman, executive director and chief economist at Irving Securities, said the data released yesterday indicated that the economy was weaker than the figures implied. 'Consumers Reluctant Buyers' **********Mr. Braverman, who had been predicting for several months that the economy and the rise in interest rates would both start slowing in March, said: ''It's no secret that consumers have been increasingly reluctant buyers, particularly of big-ticket items such as cars. Whether retail sales are falling because of the Fed's upward pressure on interest rates or whether consumers are reacting to the much smaller portions of instalment credit costs that they can apply against tax liabilities, the fact is they are becoming less inclined to spend.'' **********While the Fed is not expected to ease credit until the summer at the earliest, Mr. Braverman said, ''they have been sending out subtle signals recently that they are now less inclined to tighten credit further.'' **********He added: ''This doesn't mean the inflation threat is over. Today's numbers did not cover the recent surge in energy costs, particularly gasoline, or the rebound in farm commodity prices.'' Temporary Reserves Increased **********One signal may have been the action taken yesterday by the Fed to add $1.5 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system, when the key interbank lending rate was 9 13/16 percent. This bedrock borrowing rate, termed the Federal funds rate, was at that level most of the day. **********But Maria Fiorini Ramirez, managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., attributed the Fed's move more to seasonal factors. As she explained: ''While it appears that interest rates have topped out, this is the time of year when the Fed adds reserves to offset the huge drain from the banking system caused by tax payments. The Fed does this by buying Treasury securities from banks and other financial institutions. So it will take a few more weeks before the Fed's day-to-day operations become clearer.'' **********One result of the Fed's buying of securities has been to create a tight supply of Treasury coupon issues at a time when the market is awash with liquidity, Mrs. Ramirez noted. Meanwhile, investors are also pouring savings into money market funds, which are in turn buying large amounts of the relatively stable supply of Treasury bills and other short-term instruments. **********The demand for short-term bills was largely responsible for the 50-basis-point drop in their discount rates in the last two weeks, Mrs. Ramirez added. A basis point is one-hundredth of a point. **********Late yesterday, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills was down 16 basis points, at 8.61 percent; the six-month issue was off 24 basis points, at 8.59 percent, and the one-year bills fell 21 basis points, to 8.62 percent.

An Enhanced Image **********Some diplomats said they suspected that Mr. Genscher went to Washington fully aware that his position would be rejected, but that he also knew this would enhance his domestic image as a proud German standing up to the English-speaking nuclear powers. **********Mr. Genscher repeatedly stressed that Washington acknowledged West Germany's ''tremendously important position in this dialogue'' and its ''special right to speak out on these questions because of the number of short-range rockets stationed on its soil.'' **********He refused to discuss what he called the Government's new military stance, saying he could not do so until Mr. Kohl formally presents it in a package of new policies this Thursday.

Despite the public revulsion when civilians are among the victims, the violence by both sides in the struggle shows no signs of abating, Mr. McCauley spoke in Sinn Fein's fortresslike headquarters in Lurgan. In November 1982, when he was 19, he and a companion, Michael Justin Tighe, 17, both Catholics, went to check on a neighbor's barn and came under fire from a special police team. **********The barn proved to be an I.R.A. weapons cache, and the incident is widely believed by the Catholics who support unification with Ireland to be a result of what they call an official policy of shooting at I.R.A. suspects first and asking questions later. Mr. Tighe died instantly. **********Mr. McCauley said in court that he had known nothing about the rifles in the barn and charged that the police had opened fire without warning. A judge threw out the police testimony but disbelieved him as well and gave him a suspended sentence on a charge of illegal possession of weapons. Traffic Turned Away **********''My parents still have Protestant friends,'' Mr. McCauley said today. ''They came up to my mother when I was in the hospital and asked how I was. But their sons will grow up, and they'll be asking where do I live, so they can come and shoot me.'' **********British soldiers in camouflage uniforms, semi-automatic combat rifles at the ready, turned away all traffic from Warrenpoint after the bombing.

Other Recent BSN Purchases **********In June, BSN, which markets Dannon yogurt, Kronenbourg beer and Evian mineral water, acquired five cookie and snack subsidiaries of RJR Nabisco for $2.5 billion, before selling off two of them to Pepsico for $1.35 billion. Also in June, BSN acquired control of Greece's No. 2 beer company, Henninger Hellas. **********BSN executives said they had acquired 35 percent of the equity in Galbani, which is known for Bel Paese cheese, while the Agnellis' IFIL operation would hold 65 percent. In March, BSN joined with the Agnelli family, the largest shareholder of the Fiat automobile group, to acquire a 45 percent stake in Star, a leading Italian grocery group. **********''The Galbani purchase is a great move,'' said Sylvain Massot, an analyst with the London brokerage UBS Phillips & Drew. ''It creates many synergies between grocery and fresh foods. This will probably make BSN the No. 1 food company in Italy.'' Link to IFIL Is Praised **********Analysts praised BSN's strategy of linking up with IFIL, because such a tie enables it to expand its distribution network without overstretching its finanical resources. Many analysts had asked wheher BSN had overextended itself when it bought the RJR Nabisco subsidiaries, but analysts now say that BSN must have sold the snack food subsidiaires to Pepsico in anticipation of the Galbani acquisition. **********BSN and the Agnelli family began cooperating in 1987, when they purchased the Sangemini mineral water group, which sells Ferrarelle, Italy's most popular sparkling water. In September 1987, BSN and the Agnellis announced an accord in which IFIL would acquire 4 percent of BSN's equity, while BSN acquired 20 percent in IFIL's. **********Galbani, which analysts said was family owned, has 17 percent of the Italian cheese market, including 18 percent of mozzarella sales. In 1988, Galbani had net income of 123 billion lire, or about $88.3 million at current exchange rates, on revenues of 1.450 trillion lire, or about $1 billion. **********''This fits very well into BSN's strategy of expanding in southern Europe, which is the fastest-growing market in Europe,'' said Andrew Shepherd-Barron, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. Pan-European Network **********Executives at BSN said the Galbani acquisition should allow it to use its Pan-European distribution network to market Galbani products far beyond Italy. In addition, the acquisition should enable BSN to increase the penetration of its Dannon and Gervais dairy products in Italy. **********Under their agreement with IFIL, BSN executives said, their company manages the concerns that the two own jointly. BSN owns 20 percent of IFIL's equity, and as a result it directly or indirectly owns 48 percent of Galbani. **********''Because BSN is a French company, it's unlikely to have contacts in the Italian business community to get them around a table to make an offer,'' said Mr. Phipps, the County NatWest analyst. ''Obviously the Agnellis can open most doors.'' Sales of $3 Billion in Italy **********With the Galbani acquisition, BSN, through operations it directly or indirectly controls, will have close to $3 billion in sales in Italy. One of the businesses that BSN acquired from RJR Nabisco was Saiwa, a leading biscuit and snack company in Italy. **********Analysts questioned how BSN would finance its Galbani stake. ''I'm not sure what their balance sheet is going to be like after this, but obviously they don't feel very stretched,'' Mr. Phipps said. Some analysts suggested that to help finance its Galbani stake, BSN might announce a rights issue that would be purchased by IFIL. **********Besides Bel Paese, Galbani has several well-known brand names, including Galbi, Certosa and Santa Lucia. Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, has long said that it is important to have and acquire respected brand names. **********''Mr. Riboud always said that in order to do business in Italy, you need an Italian godfather,'' Mr. Shepherd-Barron of Kleinwort Benson said.

An agreement is expected to be signed next week, they said. **********The deals would bring Kohlberg, Kravis about the amount that many Wall Street deal makers had estimated it would receive from selling the Del Monte operations. Reducing a Big Debt **********The sale of Del Monte is part of a program to reduce the debt that RJR Nabisco took on in the $24.88 billion buyout engineered earlier this year by Kohlberg, Kravis. In June, most of Nabisco's European snack food businesses were sold to the BSN Group of France for $2.5 billion. **********As part of the deal with Citicorp, RJR Nabisco would retain all the Del Monte canning and processing operations in Canada. A person involved in the talks said the Canadian operations would not be sold because they were ''intertwined'' with Nabisco Foods in Canada. **********The Del Monte acquisition will make Polly Peck a global giant in produce, putting it in third position, behind Castle & Cooke Inc. and the United Brands Company. **********Polly Peck already has a substantial fresh produce business in Europe, where its biggest brand is Sunzest and its strength is in citrus fruit and tomatoes. The company also has extensive operations in Turkey and non-European Mediterranean countries. It has made several small acquisitions recently in the United States and in the Pacific region. **********Polly Peck said the Del Monte Fresh Fruit Company would continue to be headed by Brian Haycox. The unit, with 12,000 employees worldwide, sold nearly 1.1 million tons of bananas and 275,000 tons of fresh pineapples in 1988. Chairman Holds a Stake **********Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, holds 25 percent of the company. Mr. Nadir, a British citizen who originally came from the Turkish part of Cyprus, has headed the company since 1980. He began in business by buying, packing and marketing fruit from Turkey and Cyprus. Mr. Nadir is also an important publisher in Turkey, where he owns several newspapers in Istanbul. **********Mr. Nadir said that the Del Monte deal was ''a remarkable opportunity'' and that it would combine two operations that complement each other. Del Monte is the world's largest supplier of pineapples and is No. 3 in bananas. **********Mark Ellis, Polly Peck's director of corporate development, said that Polly Peck would switch most of its products to the Del Monte name, with the Sunzest brand being retained only in a few cases. **********Polly Peck said it would pay for the acquisition by raising about $438 million through a stock offering to existing shareholders and by borrowing about $500 million from a bank. CS First Boston Ltd. arranged the financing for the deal, which is expected to be completed on Oct. 26. The First Boston Corporation acted as financial adviser to Polly Peck. **********Analysts and investors were equally enthusiastic about the deal. After closing on Wednesday at 298 pence, or $4.62, Polly Peck's shares rose yesterday to 368 pence, or $5.70, in late trading on the London Stock Exchange. **********''It's really a great deal for them,'' said Julia Jackson, a securities analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. At about 12 times earnings, the price Polly Peck will pay is ''fairly good,'' she said. Earnings at $88 Million **********In 1988, Del Monte had pretax earnings of $88 million, including $9 million from other Nabisco units, on sales of $600 million.

Michael Losh, 43 years old, would replace William W. Lane, 60, as the head of Oldsmobile, which is based in Lansing, Mich. **********The shake-up will result in the early retirement next year of Mr. Lane, who has run Oldsmobile as a G.M. vice president since 1985. As an interim move, Mr. Lane was named to the new position of vice president for dealer and customer network development. **********Replacing Mr. Losh at Pontiac is John G. Middlebrook, 48, the vice president of G.M.'s central marketing and product planning staff. **********Since the early 1980's, when G.M.'s overall share of the market for American-built cars began its precipitous slide, from close to 60 percent in 1983 to 48.3 percent last year, Pontiac has bucked the trend. From an 8.1 percent share of American-built cars in 1983, Pontiac reached a peak of 10.2 percent in 1986 before retreating to 9.5 percent in 1988. Executives credit Pontiac with carving out a distinct image for itself at as maker of youthful and sporty cars under the advertising slogan ''We Build Excitement.'' **********Oldsmobile, on the other hand, had nearly 15 percent of the market for domestically built cars in 1983, and it was consistently selling a million or more cars annually. But the division's share had dropped to 9.5 percent by 1988, when it sold slightly more than 700,000 cars. Analysts blame Oldsmobile's difficulties on its unsuccessful quest for a distinct image and for carefully focused products when the market is becoming increasingly fragmented. **********Mr. Losh has a formidable task: forging an image and a product strategy for Oldsmobile just when the United States is crowded with domestic and imported brands.

''He has to support the interests of the working class. Of course, that old industrial working class is changing. People in the service sector are in the working class, but they are different from steel workers. He has to defend socialism.'' **********Mr. Hall said the party remained committed to revolution, adding: **********''We want to overthrow the capitalist system. But the means that we have chosen are ones of mass education and propaganda. We have our newspaper and we appear on talk shows and we will take part in elections.'' **********Asked whether old party positions in defense of old Soviet actions were proving embarrassing now that the Soviet leadership was challenging some of them, Mr. Hall said every political party had such problems. **********Asked specifically about the party's position today on the Soviet-Nazi pact of 1939, Stalin's purge trials and the 1956 invasion of Hungary, he said: ''I never believed that we should dwell too much on the past. I have been much more interested in the future.'' **********The American Communist leader was asked about the period when Communists all over the world proclaimed that ''the future belongs to us.''

This year's losses, $9.7 billion in the first nine months, are running slightly behind the 1988 pace. **********Still, depositors withdrew about $9 billion more than they deposited in September, Mr. Barth said. This amount compares with $5.1 billion in August and is close to the record $10.8 billion in January, he said. **********The thrift office estimated that 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent savings institutions, holding about 45 percent of the industry's $1.3 trillion in assets, fall nearly $20 billion short of the new capital standard. **********Brian P. Smith, the league's regulatory expert, said several hundred savings institutions would be able to reduce or otherwise adjust their balance sheets to meet the standard quickly.

He called for negotiations to end the civil war, and promised to fight for human rights and to work to improve education and health care. **********''The only privileged people in our society will be the very poor,'' he said after being sworn in to replace Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat. **********But Mr. Cristiani took a tough stance on negotiating an end to the nine-year-old civil war, in which 70,000 Salvadorans have been killed. He emphasized that he would not discuss power-sharing, a central rebel demand. Evolution to Respectability **********The alliance, which counts many of the country's most radical rightists as its members, has had a dramatic rise. Founded eight years ago as a paramilitary group to block social changes that Washington thought necessary to stop a Marxist-led revolution, Arena now controls all the major centers of power. **********The inauguration marked the failure of almost a decade of American efforts to build up the Christian Democrats as a centrist bulwark against El Salvador's political extremes. But it is also a focal point in the American-backed effort to foster democracy in this country, whose history has been written by a series of military regimes. **********The rebels, who had pledged that during the inauguration they would mount an offensive to show they could make El Salvador ungovernable, imposed a nationwide transportation ban and stepped up their campaign of economic sabotage. But they appeared less successful than with similar efforts in the past. **********Mr. Cristiani, a 41-year-old coffee grower, was greeted warmly when he entered the inauguration hall, a concrete building on the international fairgrounds.

Industries P.L.C., when Britain's Panel of Takeovers and Mergers gave the group an indefinite extension to clear regulatory hurdles in the United States. **********Analysts said it was extraordinary for the panel to grant such an extension. The ruling, they said, set a precedent that could affect battles to acquire other British companies with foreign subsidiaries. The panel acknowledged as much and said it would establish guidelines to deal with similar cases. **********''It sets a precedent; in that sense, it's quite important,'' said Andrew Mitchell, an analyst at the Smith New Court Agency, a London securities firm. **********Under British takeover rules, a bidder has 46 days after formally making its offer to announce new information or revise the offer and 60 days to complete the offer. Under that timetable, Hoylake Investments Ltd., which is offering $21 billion in securities for B.A.T., had until Sept. 23 to revise its bid and until Oct. 28 to complete it. If the offer is not completed by 60 days, the bidder must wait a year before making another one. The Sept. 23 deadline was also seen as crucial, because B.A.T.'s shareholders were considered unlikely to accept an offer containing no cash. Analysts now expect Hoylake to revise its offer to include cash. They said that Sir James had indicated he might do so, once he had overcome the hurdles in the United States. **********Hoylake's attempt to buy B.A.T., the diversified tobacco, insurance and retailing concern, has been bogged down in the United States because B.A.T. owns the Farmers Group, a big American insurer. That means that Hoylake needs the approval of insurance regulators in nine states, but there was virtually no chance of obtaining all those approvals before the British deadlines expired. **********Ruling that the American regulatory delay would prevent B.A.T.'s shareholders from having ''a real opportunity to consider an offer for B.A.T. on its merits,'' the takeover panel gave Hoylake an indefinite extension. The panel said Hoylake's bid could lapse, and it could then make another within 21 days of clearing the regulatory hurdles in the United States. **********In trading today on the London Stock Exchange, B.A.T.'s stock rose as high as 844 pence, or $13.15, and closed at 819 pence, or $12.76, up 19 pence, or 30 cents. **********B.A.T. said it would appeal the decision to the panel's appeal committee. **********B.A.T., which has argued that Hoylake is responsible for its regulatory difficulties, said in a statement that the panel ruling ''throws a lifeline to a bid that was plainly failing on its merits both before shareholders and the U.S. regulators.'' It added, ''This wrong decision undermines one of the City Code's fundamental principles by committing B.A.T. Industries' shareholders to an indefinite and damaging siege.'' The City is London's financial district. **********Hoylake said in a statement that ''we welcome the panel's decision.'' It said Sir James would leave immediately for the United States to meet with legal advisers about ''the best way to continue to expedite the U.S. regulatory approvals.'' **********Hoylake has filed cases in Federal courts, arguing that the state authorities' ability to block its bid is an unconstitutional restraint on international commerce. Three district courts, in Texas, California and Washington, have rejected Hoylake's argument, and the company announced on Tuesday that it would appeal those rulings. To Sell Insurer **********Hoylake has already agreed to sell Farmers for $4.5 billion in cash and bonds to Axa-Midi, France's third-largest insurer, which has also agreed to supply Hoylake with $930 million in capital. Claude BeBear, Axa's chairman and chief executive, has been in the United States, trying to reassure state officials about his company's plans to buy Farmers. **********In a telephone interview from San Francisco after the takeover panel's ruling, Mr. BeBear said: ''We are very positive now.

Mosbacher said the Soviet Government might become eligible for more favorable treatment under American trade laws ''within the next one to three months'' if it carries through on its promise. But it might take longer, he said. **********The State Department emphasized Mr. Bush's position that the emigration bill must not only be passed but also ''implemented'' before the United States would suspend trade barriers imposed on Moscow in the last 15 years.

''In addition, some adult applicants who were unable to obtain the consent of their parents for their departure could not leave.'' **********''It is my understanding that the new law would deal with both these issues,'' Mr. Schifter said. ''If it does, and if its provisions are implemented as we hope they will be, our concerns will have been met.'' **********Under the bill, Soviet citizens with access to state secrets could be forbidden to emigrate for up to five years. It is not clear whether this provision is retroactive, nor is it clear whether Soviet citizens denied exit permits for the last five years could immediately leave the Soviet Union. 'Just a Technical Matter' **********Mr. Dubinin said that such questions, considered to be of paramount importance by Soviet Jews and their advocates in the United States, were ''just a technical matter.'' In general, he said, the new law will be administered in a generous spirit, and ''there will not be obstacles of a technical nature.'' **********But Micah H. Naftalin, national director of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, expressed concern that ''Jackson-Vanik will be prematurely waived in the euphoria of the moment'' when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev meet. **********Mr. Dubinin said he did not know exactly when the emigration bill would become law. Soviet emigration has already increased dramatically, with Soviet Jews, evangelical Christians and Armenians accounting for most of the exodus in the last 18 months. The United States, overwhelmed with applications from would-be Soviet refugees, has established new procedures to restrict their admission to this country. **********President Bush has set a limit of 50,000 on the number of Soviet citizens who can be admitted to the United States as refugees in the current fiscal year. Some Questions Remain **********Pamela B. Cohen, president of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, said her organization had a list of 253 Soviet families denied permission to leave the Soviet Union ''on a variety of pretexts.'' The list, she said, includes 105 families denied exit permits because of access to state secrets and 121 who could not get the necessary permission from relatives. **********Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, ''The Soviet Union has made real and dramatic improvements in emigration policy, but has still not said whether it will release all the long-term refuseniks.'' Thus, he said, it would be premature for the United States to lower tariffs by giving the Soviet Union ''most-favored-nation treatment'' under the trade laws. **********Mr. Dubinin, like Soviet officials in Moscow, said there was ''absolutely no linkage'' between the Soviet emigration bill and recent events in Eastern Europe, where thousands of East Germans have fled their country. He noted that the bill liberalizing Soviet emigration procedures was introduced in the Soviet Parliament in August. **********But American officials said the Soviets displayed no sense of urgency about the legislation until this month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/02/world/indian-opposition-chooses-a-premier.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1989-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 826, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIAN OPPOSITION CHOOSES A PREMIER", "print_headline": "INDIAN OPPOSITION CHOOSES A PREMIER", "body_text": " **********V. P. Singh won the unanimous backing of the victorious political opposition today and will be sworn in as the eighth Prime Minister of India at noon on Saturday, the office of the President said tonight. **********The new Government, the result of the defeat of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party in elections last week, will be only the second in 42 years of Indian independence not under the control of the Congress Party. And it will be the fourth not headed by a member of the political dynasty founded by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. **********This afternoon, enthusiastic crowds gathered outside the Parliament building to cheer Mr. Singh as the opposition met in two brief sessions, the first held by Mr. Singh's own Janata Dal Party and the second by the larger National Front. The voting was over in minutes. **********Mr. Singh will head a minority cabinet supported from outside by four left-wing parties and by the conservative, Hindu-based Bharatiya Janata Party. It will have 30 days to test itself in a vote of confidence in Parliament. **********The Congress Party had no comment today on the election of Mr. Singh. **********In his first news conference as Prime Minister-elect, Mr. Singh, speaking in his characteristic low-keyed, occasionally fumbling style, thanked the poorest people of India for their support and promised to apportion more of the national budget and a larger role in decision-making to rural areas, where more than three-quarters of India's 810 million people live. Broader Participation **********''The process of democracy has to be extended,'' he said. ''We want to insure the participation of the deprived and weaker sections in the shaping of the destiny of the country.'' **********Mr. Singh said that he would not be vindictive in pursuing allegations of corruption in Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Government, but would let the judicial system take its course. He said an office of national ombudsman would be revived to deal with future allegations of official corruption. **********Mr. Singh said radio and television, now government monopolies criticized as propaganda outlets, would become autonomous and that ''the right to freedom of information will be enshrined in the constitution.'' **********As for international relations, he said that India's foreign policy was dictated by ''the geopolitical situation of our country.'' Priority, he said, would be given to problems with neighboring Nepal, under an Indian trade embargo, and Sri Lanka, where the Government wants an Indian force withdrawn. **********Mr. Singh, a minister in the outgoing Government of Prime Minister Gandhi until his resignation to protest corruption in high places, won the first crucial round of support today in a swift power play that sidelined his only serious rival, Chandra Shekhar. **********When the Janata Dal, or People's Party, assembled in the central hall of Parliament shortly after 3 P.M., Mr. Singh proposed the name of Devi Lal, Chief Minister of Haryana state and a leader of north Indian farmers. Mr. Lal was elected by acclamation, to the suprise of many. But he immediately withdrew in favor of Mr. Singh, a choice then unanimously confirmed by the party. What Opponent Might Do **********Mr. Shekhar, who opposed Mr. Singh and believed the nomination of Mr. Lal to be a genuine alternative and not a stalking horse, as it turned out, said afterward that he had been ''betrayed.'' Although he pledged to cooperate with the new Government, it was assumed that he would probably wait in the wings for a chance to undercut it. **********Mr. Singh's cabinet is likely to be named over the weekend, when a new Parliament is expected to assemble and be sworn in. Its makeup will determine how much the new government may backtrack on Mr. Gandhi's policies of liberalizing the economy. **********Among the people likely to be named to the cabinet is George Fernandes, a strong economic nationalist who is critical of India's opening over the last five years to more foreign investment and Western technology, especially in nonessential goods. **********Mr. Fernandes, as Industry Minister in the last non-Congress Government, from 1977 to 1979, forced Coca-Cola and I.B.M. out of the country. Last year, Pepsi-Cola negotiated an agreement with India to set up several plants, and Coca-Cola has also expressed interest in returning. **********''I guess people in America are worried as to whether Pepsi-Cola will be asked to go back,'' he said today. ''Well, if I have my way, I will ask them to leave the country. **********''There are innumerable villages in Muzzafarpur, my constituency, where there isn't drinking water available,'' Mr. Fernandes added.

''Under the pressure of violence and clashes, it's quite impossible to get real talks.'' Idea Derived From Camp David **********Mr. Shamir has been under pressure from the Bush Administration to come up with new ideas to advance the chances for a settlement in the Middle East. Until the interview today, he had declined to say what he would put forth while in Washington. At the same time, he has been pressed here in Israel to discuss his ideas before going to the United States. **********The election idea, taken almost directly from the Camp David agreement with Egypt, is the centerpiece of the peace proposals Mr. Shamir intends to make ''to see the reaction of the U.S. Government.'' **********Other Israeli leaders have raised the possibility of elections. But the Palestine Liberation Organization, which asserts that it speaks for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, has scorned any Israeli-inspired elections, as have Palestinians active in the uprising. New Refugee Housing **********In the interview, the Prime Minister repeated his refusal to negotiate or have any talks with the P.L.O., but he did not rule out the election of candidates who sympathize with the P.L.O. **********Mr. Shamir, who spoke in English during the interview, said he also planned to raise about $500 million from foreign governments that would be used to build housing for the 350,000 residents of refugee centers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********''This could be accomplished in more or less a decade,'' Mr. Shamir said, and ''could contribute to a large extent to the creation of a different atmosphere in the territories.'' **********''At the same time it will be a real solution of their problems,'' he continued. No Compromise on P.L.O.  And he said he would call for ''a meeting of the signatories of the Camp David agreement,'' Egypt, the United States and Israel, ''to ask them to contribute to a beginning of talks and negotiations with Palestinian Arabs, to see what we can do together.'' **********''These are the main points'' of his proposals to end the Palestinian uprising, to open talks with Israel's Arab neighbors, and to ''start talks on solutions for the problems of the Palestinians living under our rule,'' Mr. Shamir said. **********Not among the points is any relaxation in Mr. Shamir's opposition to negotiations with the P.L.O. now or in the future. ''It is known already that we are not ready to talk to the P.L.O.,'' Mr. Shamir said. **********He also said he opposed the idea, suggested by American officials, of relaxing the Israeli presence in the occupied territories to improve the atmosphere for possible negotiations. **********''The means we are taking'' in the territories ''are a result of attacks against us,'' he said. ''We will stop all these means when the attacks end.'' 'My Way Will Take Longer' **********Since he took office in Israel's new Government in December, Mr. Shamir has promised that he will devise a peace plan to present to the American Government, Israel's closest ally and financial benefactor. **********In an interview with the newspaper Haaretz early this month, Mr. Shamir said he would take ideas to Washington that would ''greatly satisfy the aspirations'' of the Arabs and ''bring about if not a complete resolution of the problem, at least a good part of it.'' **********Today he said ''I don't think one meeting in Washington'' will solve everything. **********On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the Administration was ''very anxious'' that Mr. Shamir bring ''new ideas.'' with him to Washington next week. To that, Mr. Shamir said: ''These are new ideas. I never said it before.'' **********Mr. Shamir has proposed renovating the Palestinian refugee camps before. Last fall, in fact, he suggested that an international conference be held to address the refugee situation. And although before today he had never endorsed the widely discussed idea of election in the territories, all along he has held to the Camp David agreement as the basis for his plan. Camp David calls for elections too. **********''The main focus is not on new ideas,'' Mr. Shamir said. ''What is needed is ideas that are realistic and reasonable. We are ready to go a long way to resolve the conflict. **********''Many Palestinians will understand that my way will take longer,'' he said. ''But it is the only realistic way.'' Palestinians in the territories have made it clear that they do not intend to halt the uprising and would not vote in Israeli-sponsored elections in any case, unless the P.L.O. approved. **********After Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin proposed elections in the territories earlier this year, the P.L.O. said in no uncertain terms that it would oppose them. The group sees itself as the only legitimate representive of the territories' residents. **********The P.L.O. and many West Bank Palestinians have opposed the idea of renovating the refugee camps, too, since their aim has been to return the refugees to their original homes in what is now Israel. **********''Maybe the P.L.O. will be against it, maybe,'' Mr. Shamir said. ''But they will not be able to resist the readiness and willingness of the population to get this opportunity.'' Elections to Have 2 Stages **********To the likely blanket opposition from Palestinians and Arab governments to all his ideas, as long as the P.L.O. is excluded from the process, Mr. Shamir said: ''They will have to choose. We are ready to go forward and satisfy a great part of their aspirations. But we are determined not to do it with the P.L.O.'' **********Mr. Shamir said that if elections are held, ''There will have to be a general agreement that these people are elected for a specific purpose, to talk about the solutions, and the talks will be linked to a certain pattern.'' **********He did not exclude the likelihood that most or all of the people chosen in an election would be supporters of the P.L.O. **********The election pattern Mr. Shamir described is similar to that outlined in the Camp David agreement, which was signed 10 years ago this month. The talks would be in two stages, and the first would be to set out ''interim arrangements for establishing a large degree of self-rule for a transitional period, a period of test.'' **********After about three years of autonomy, he said, ''there will start negotiations about the permanent status with the goal that the outcome will satisfy both parties.'' **********''There is no use to define the outcome'' of these negotiations now, Mr. Shamir said. But he has repeatedly made it clear that he would not be satisfied with any outcome that did not leave Israel with sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza. **********''In the land of Israel, there can be just one country, the state of Israel,'' he told a Likud party conference on Monday. **********Today he said: ''Look, they can propose whatever they want. I have my views, I have my positions. But I don't know who will be representing Israel in these negotiations.'' Whoever it is, he added, ''I am sure there will be contradictory positions.'' **********''There will be many difficulties in implementing'' his ideas, the Prime Minster said. But when he is in Washington, he said, ''we will try to convince them that this is the most realist way.

Such groups as the National Association of Manufacturers lobbied heavily against the plant-closing measure, which President Reagan called ''a ticking time bomb in the back seat of any medium-sized or larger company.'' **********If so, it is a bomb with a slow fuse. The measure eventually passed despite President Reagan's opposition and took effect Feb. 4. No one has totaled the figures, but reports from several states suggest that several hundred companies have complied with the act so far with no major problems. Those companies filing without incident include not only well-known giants, such as Xerox, Pillsbury and Merrill Lynch, but also firms that are exempt because they have less than 100 employees or because they are in special circumstances like bankruptcy. **********''There's some confusion out there about when a company is supposed to file,'' said Valerie Reynoso, spokeswoman for California's Employment Development Department, which had received 62 notices by March 9. ''About 30 percent of the filings come from companies that are exempt for one reason or another.'' The main exemption - for small companies - means that the law applies to about 2 percent of the nation's businesses and less than half of its private-sector employees. **********But state officials say early indications are that the law is apparently doing exactly what supporters said it would do - making it easier to deliver support counseling and retraining services to workers whose jobs are eliminated. Studies show that the sooner workers get such services, the quicker they find new jobs, thus limiting the economic and social costs of shutdowns. That is one reason smaller companies are also participating, state officials say. **********''Our experience has been very positive,'' said Richard J. Baker, industrial adjustment consultant to Michigan, which has received notification of about 15 closings. ''We are getting notification of closings that we might not have known about before, or getting them sooner and in more detail.'' **********Workers seem to appreciate the services they are getting as a result of the new law, even though many of were not aware of the legislation. Commenting on a recent presentation by New Jersey officials on jobless benefits and programs, Grace Colaci, a worker the Haband Company, a New Jersey mail order firm said, ''I thought it was great.'' The plant where she works in Fair Lawn, N. J. is closing in April. **********Business groups that opposed the law and corporate attorneys specializing in labor law say the early calm is probably deceptive. They argue that it is too soon for lawsuits to have begun over the numerous ambiguities about what circumstances require the notification and exactly who is covered. Indeed, the Department of Labor's final regulations implementing the law are not due to be published until the end of the month and most observers are betting that the current interim regulations will be extended before the deadline arrives to allow more time for changes. **********''The companies we hear from are trying to comply,'' said G. John Tysse, a partner at McGuiness & Williams, a Washington law firm that lobbied against the law for the Labor Policy Association, a group of 125 large companies.''But everybody's got their fingers crossed.'' **********Critics continue to say that the costs imposed on business could be substantial over the longer term. They warn that in order to meet the notification requirements, companies may find themselves forced to run money-losing operations longer than in the past. The alternative is to buy off workers by paying up to two months' wages. Such burdens could push already ailing concerns closer to bankruptcy, hurting more workers. **********Companies could also find that it takes far more management time to plan and schedule layoffs or close-downs with the precision required by the law. In some industries, employers may hire more part-time workers to keep down the number of employees with rights to two months' notice, which could reduce efficiency. **********The biggest question, however, may be whether state and local governments are going to have enough resources to take advantage of the early notification. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), as the law is formally known, is meant to work in tandem with another bill, the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act (EDWAA), which will take effect July 1. Under EDWAA, each state is required to develop the capac ity to respond rapidly to the WARN act notification and to oversee deployment of Federal retraining funds. **********Congress has budgeted $480 million for the first year of the program. Without additional funding, the appropriation would cover the cost of finding new jobs for just 160,000 work ers, based on an average cost of more than $3,000 per worker in prior federally supported job-training programs. The number of workers notified of layoffs under the WARN act annually will vary widely with economic conditions, but a 1987 General Accounting Office study of layoffs in 1983 and 1984 suggests that the figure will top one million even in times when the economy is growing. The support programs range from lessons in writing resumes to courses at local colleges and subsidies to companies hiring unemployed workers who need on-the-job training. **********''National studies show we used to reach between 3 percent and 5 percent of all dislocated workers with support programs,'' said Mr. Baker. ''Now we will reach a lot more, but the great unanswered question is whether we can meet the challenge of providing quality services to them.'' **********Michigan has been experimenting for three years with models developed in Canada, where industrial adjustment programs emphasize early intervention, improving workers' job-search skills and identifying potential jobs rather than spending on retraining or subsidies for companies that hire unemployed workers. That approach has allowed Canada to relocate workers at an average cost of about $300, Mr. Baker said. It is help ing Michigan hold relocation costs to an average around $1,200, far below the United States average. **********Mr. Baker, however, conceded that the state's relatively high level of unionization may give Michigan officials an advantage not available in other states. A number of unions, notably the United Auto Workers, have extensive programs to aid members in finding new jobs. And contracts with such major employers as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler routinely provided for six months' notification of layoffs even before WARN was adopted. **********Such contracts are exceptional though. One-third of the businesses covered by the WARN act have in the past laid off workers with no notice at all, according to a General Accounting Office study published in 1987. Of those that gave notice, over one-third gave less than two weeks and half gave less than a month. **********The WARN act allows workers let go without legal notice to sue for up to 60 days of lost wages. A union or local government body can also sue on behalf of employees. When the local government sues, the remedy includes a $500-a-day penalty for each violation unless the employer pays employees the amount due them within three weeks of ordering the shutdown or layoff. **********However, the act gives businesses numerous protections. It excludes seasonal layoffs, which are common in construction and agriculture. It also exempts companies that are hit by natural disasters or unforeseen circumstances, such as the cancellation of an order by a major customer. Nor is notice required if the company is ''faltering'' and management in good faith delays giving notice in order to pursue options, such as getting a loan, issuing stock or seeking new business - all situations where giving notice scheduling a close-down or major layoffs may make it impossible to get the needed funds to keep the business going. **********These protections, inserted at the insistence of business, are now a major source of ambiguity as companies try to figure out how they will be interpreted. Other questions include how to define a ''site'' at which layoffs are occurring and exactly how to calculate the wages due employees if a company wants to pay them off instead of giving 60 days' notice. No one knows, for instance, if average overtime worked during the previous months should be included. **********''The difficulty with this legislation is no longer philosophical, it's practical,'' said Roberts T. Jones, the Assistant Secretary of Labor in charge of Employment and Training Administration. ''People are getting back to us with specific situations they want clarified. The real issue in these cases is whether you create 10 more problems by solving their dilemma.'' **********Labor Department officials said that more than 80 comments had been received in response to the interim regulations published in December. Many complained about the detail required in the notices, which call on companies to be specific about projected layoff dates, to name employees and to categorize those laid off by job. Lawyers say the task becomes daunting in situations where employees have the right to bump those with less seniority. **********''I did a notice for a plant in Alabama that had 90 separate job classifications with up to 20 people in each one,'' said Robert Lemert, an attorney at Constangy, Brooks and Smith, an Atlanta law firm. In another case, Mr. Lemert said, the law may force a client to run a textile mill it wants to acquire in Tennessee for 60 days. His client, whom he declined to name, wants to acquire the product name, close the mill immediately and move production to one of its own underutilized mills. **********''My client is afraid that once he gives notice, people will start leaving,'' Mr. Lemert said. ''Then he may have to file a second notice seeking exemption from the notification law because the 'unforeseen business circumstance' of key people leaving makes it impossible to stay open for the 60 days.'' **********Mr. Lemert's comments reflect a widespread fear in business circles that giving 60 days notice will force companies to operate in a period when absenteeism, poor performance and even sabotage could escalate because employees know layoffs or a closing are in the offing. State officials say such fears are misplaced. **********''People realize that plants close,'' said Mr. Baker of Michigan. ''What they want is to be treated like human beings. Our experience is that companies that give lots of notice and try to help workers'' are able to ''get good production to the end and leave good feelings in the community.'' He cited the case of the closing of the Ore-Ida frozen potato plant in Greenville, Mich., which closed in 1987 and was the site of a pilot counseling and retraining program that received state, Federal and company funding. Almost 90 percent of the 517 workers had new jobs within seven months of the closing, at an average cost to the company of $29 per employee. The plant performed well until the day it closed, Mr. Baker said. **********A model of what New York State hopes to see is unfolding in the small town of Sherburne, 50 miles north of Binghamton. Sherwood Medical Products, a subsidiary of the American Home Products Corporation, filed notice in December that it intends to stop production at its Sherburne plant by June. Within days, state, county and local officials set up a task force in an office provided by Sherwood to help the 425 permanent and 100 temporary employees and seek a new owner for the plant. **********Edmund Lee, mayor of Sherburne, said the task force has been working to match individual worker's skills to jobs available in the region and to send those who need further training to nearby vocational schools. By last week, about one-quarter of the work force had left or been laid off and more than one-third of that group already had new jobs. Sixteen had enrolled in vocational school programs, Mr. Lee said. **********Numerous states report similar experiences. In California, for example, when the Simpson Timber Company of Arcata gave notice that it would lay off 300 workers at two sites, the state and the company put up $20,000 and set up task forces at each site to immediately start working on assessing worker skills and needs. State officials hope to get $300,000 more in state funds to help the workers. **********Like a handful of others, Sherwood actually filed its notice in December. The filing reflected confusion as to whether companies needed to give notice before Feb. 4, the act's effective date, if the 60-day period would take them past that date. The Labor Department encouraged that assumption. **********Nevertheless, a number of companies took the other tack of rushing to complete closures or layoffs before Feb. 4 and assuming they would be exempt. The Grumman Corporation, for example, announced major layoffs ''to be completed by the end of January'' in December. The move may well have been exempt under the law anyway because it came in response to declining orders from Grumman's largest customer, the Defense Department. **********In another case, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's Group W subsidiary fired more than 200 workers at its Filmation cartoon studio in Woodland Hills, Calif., on Feb. 3 with no notice when the studio was sold to an overseas buyer whose main interest was its library. Westinghouse provided severance pay based on length of service - in some cases equivalent to more than 60 days' pay - and offered outplacement services to all workers, according to John Moran, Group W's vice president for human resources and administration. **********''What we offered was generous by Hollywood standards,'' said Mr. Moran. ''No one was surprised because they knew we had been negotiating for months to sell. We haven't received a single complaint.'' **********If no workers or local governments challenge the actions of companies like Grumman and Westinghouse, no one will ever know when notice became mandatory. In an effort to prevent the time-consuming delays typical in regulatory proceedings, WARN provides only one recourse for settling disputes - the courts. So far, neither government officials nor any of the lobbying groups that fought so hard to pass or defeat the act have heard of any suits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/28/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Hugo Banzer Suazo, a former dictator, was generally regarded as the front-runner to succeed President Victor Paz Estenssoro. But the general and the two other major candidates, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy gold and silver mine owner, and Jaime Paz Zamora, who had plotted against General Banzer's authoritarian regime, all told reporters they were confident of victory. **********General Banzer took a slight lead tonight with nearly 20 percent of the 2.1 million registered votes unofficially tabulated by an independent La Paz television station. But few of the early results were from rural Bolivia where the two other leading candidates are believed to be strongest. **********The United States says it has no preference here and is staying neutral. None of the nine presidential candidates was expected to win a majority today and, according to Bolivian law, that would leave the final selection with Congress when it convenes in August. Relaxed Atmosphere **********On a crisp and sunny fall day, the residential sidewalks and cobblestone streets of this high Andean capital, set in a craggy, bowl-shapped canyon at 12,000 feet, were crowded with voters. **********Few cars were out as the Government enforced a long-standing election day ban on the use of all but authorized vehicles to prevent candidates from trying to gain influence by transporting people to the polls. **********Officers of the national police, some wearing riot shields on their helmets and carrying tear gas canisters, patrolled the capital. But like nearly everyone else they seemed relaxed and at ease. **********General Banzer won the popular vote in the last presidential election, four years ago, but Congress gave the presidency to the runner-up, Mr. Paz Estenssoro. **********''If that happened again,'' General Banzer said in an interview this morning, ''the people who voted and contributed to democracy would be very disappointed.'' Nevertheless, he said he would not rebel. Second Consecutive Election **********In 164 years of independence, Bolivia has weathered scores of coups and rebellions. The election today was the second consecutive presidential election after a spate of coups in the late 1970's and early 80's in which nine Governments tumbled. **********''We've had very few elections in my lifetime,'' said Teresa Soria, a retired music teacher. **********Mr. Paz Estenssoro, who is 81 years old and the first Bolivian president to complete a full term in office in a quarter of a century, joined the leading candidates in celebrating the new political atmosphere. **********''The most important thing,'' Mr. Paz Estenssoro said, ''is to definitively consolidate democracy.'' **********Mr. Sanchez de Lozado spoke of ''the right that we did not have for many years'' and said that it must be ''appreciated and preserved by all.'' **********The main campaign issue had been the Bolivian economy which virtually exploded in 1985 when inflation soared to an annual rate of 24,000 percent. **********Reeling from that shock, Mr. Paz Estenssoro, with the support of General Banzer and with Mr. Sanchez de Lozada as one of his key Cabinet members, abruptly reversed the Government's heavy involvement in the economy and Bolivia lurched into recession. 'Dragging Ourselves Up' **********More than 20 percent of the work force is still idle. But two years ago the stalled economy began growing and this year the Government is expecting to hold inflation to about 10 percent. **********Despite the austerity of the economic revolution, several voters praised Mr. Sanchez de Lozada today for contributing to Bolivia's stability. **********''We have had hard times,'' said Sofia Mendoza, a housewife. ''But now we are dragging ourselves up.'' **********Marta Marin de Quispe, wearing a brown derby and embroidered shawl, voted for General Banzer with only good memories of his past. **********''In his time, there was work and there was peace,'' she said, standing in the courtyard of a voting place dominated by a mural of Latin American liberation heros. **********''Those who were jailed,'' she said, ''were involved in politics.''

No final agreement has been signed with the additional investors. **********The investors would join Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the New York investment house that purchased RJR Nabisco in a $24.88 billion leveraged buyout this year. Under the terms of a preliminary agreement reached with the Citicorp unit last week, Kohlberg, Kravis would retain a 20 percent interest in the Del Monte operations sold to Citicorp. Federal Reserve Concerned **********If the deal is completed, Citicorp expects to sell off most of the Del Monte operations, Wall Street sources said. The company plans to split off much of Del Monte's canning and processing business, selling it to to a variety of buyers. The American business is expected to be kept as a unit, these sources said. **********The deal hit serious obstacles late last week after Federal Reserve officials expressed concern that the offer might not meet requirements of the Small Business Administration Act that restrict the equity position of a bank's venture capital unit in a deal. Because of the Fed's position, Citicorp was not able to take the equity position in Del Monte that it had originally hoped, people with knowledge of the deal said. **********Citicorp is providing the senior bank financing for the deal. It had to seek the Fed's approval because of the role of its venture capital unit. **********One person involved in the deal said that Citicorp and RJR Nabisco had not expected the Fed's concern and that the buyout was ''considered a done deal'' early last week. 'A Few Complications' **********After yesterday's negotiations, people involved in the deal said they believe they had overcome the problems pointed out by the Fed. **********''We've had a few complications, but that is normal for a complex transaction,'' a spokesman for RJR Nabisco said yesterday. ''As each complication comes up, we work it out. The deal is still under discussion, and we think it is going to get done.'' A spokeswoman for Citicorp declined to provide additional comment, but said the bank concurred with the RJR Nabisco statement. **********The final deal with Citicorp had been expected to be announced last week, but the completion was delayed by the Fed's concern and legal issues over the use of the Del Monte trademark. **********Del Monte's fresh fruit and vegetable business would not be included in the Citicorp deal. Those operations were sold this month for $875 million to Polly Peck International P.L.C., a London-based food company. Nor will the deal include Del Monte's Canadian operation. **********RJR Nabisco had sought to sell Del Monte as one piece, but buyers who offered acceptable prices were interested in either its fruit and vegetable operations or its canned food and processing operation. As a result, the company decided to sell the subsidiary in two pieces. Debt Reduction Plan **********The proposed Del Monte sale is part of the effort to reduce the debt RJR Nabisco took on in the buyout engineered by Kohlberg, Kravis. In June, most of RJR Nabisco's European snack food businesses were sold to the BSN Groupe of France for $2.5 billion. **********The problems with the trademark arose because Citicorp plans to sell much of the company. In its deal, Polly Peck obtained a strong contract to use the Del Monte trademark, which some deal makers said would make the resale of the canned food and processing units more difficult. **********In consumer goods, a trademark is considered a valuable asset. Any purchaser from Citicorp would likely have to obtain a license from Del Monte to continue to use the name. **********People involved in the deal said yesterday that the trademark issue has been discussed in recent days and that they believed the problem could be resolved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/30/business/treasury-issues-recover-after-early-drop.html": {"writer_name": "H.

That, along with a weaker dollar, depressed the prices of Treasury securities early in the day, dealers said. **********But later in the session, the shorter maturities recovered as the funds rate declined and the longer issues improved somewhat as the dollar firmed. Some traders who had sold Treasuries short bought to cover their positions. **********Dealers said that the Government's report of a three-tenths of a percent rise in the leading economic indicators for August was slightly above expectations but had no impact on the fixed-income market. Nor did the rise in spot crude oil prices to over $20 a barrel, a new contract high, affect prices. **********''Over all, the dollar remains the major influence in the Treasury debt market, but yesterday and today it was the end-of-quarter upward pressure on the Federal funds rate that moved prices,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''Come Monday morning, we expect this pressure to evaporate and the funds rate to start easing.'' Temporary Loans **********The Federal funds rate is what banks and other financial houses charge each other for temporary loans. The demand for the funds was so great that the rate rose despite the Federal Reserve's second infusion of $1.5 billion of reserves into the banking system in as many days. **********As a result, Mr. Sullivan noted, the funds rate, which had traded between 9.20 and 9.5 percent on Thursday, jumped as high as 9.75 percent early yesterday, and then declined to close at 8.5 percent. Mr. Sullivan expects the funds rate to trade at 8.875 percent, where many money market analysts think the Fed wants it, sometime next week. ''There are ample reserves in the market,'' he said. ''It's just that they are not being efficiently allocated.'' **********Because most Treasury securities dealers finance their inventories at about the funds rate, their higher carrying cost prompted many to mark down inventories of the lower-yielding bills and notes. **********Consequently, the discount rate on Treasury 90-day bills rose a basis point, to 7.90 percent; the six-month bills gained three basis points, at 7.87 percent, and the one-year bills added two basis points, at 7.86 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Prices of Notes **********Elsewhere in the secondary market for Treasury issues, the new 8 3/8 percent notes that were auctioned Tuesday at an average yield of 8.39 percent were offered late in the day at an unchanged price of 99 28/32, to yield 8.44 percent. The new 8 1/4's of 1993 rose 1/32, to 99 17/32, for a yield of 8.39 percent. The new four-year notes were auctioned last Wednesday at an average yield of 8.35 percent. Many of the speculators who bought the new two- and four-year notes were prominent sellers of these issues yesterday, dealers said. **********The bellwether Treasury long bonds, the 8 1/8's of 2019, climbed 7/32, to 98 26/32, after being as low as 98 5/ 32 early in the session. At 98 26/32, the yield eased to 8.23 percent, from 8.24 percent the previous day, but was above the 8.19 percent of a week earlier. **********In Chicago, the spot December Treasury bond futures contract settled at 95.27, up 4/32 on the day, but down 12/32 on the week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/23/world/europeans-fear-92-economic-unity-may-benefit-mafia.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1989-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1391, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EUROPEANS FEAR '92 ECONOMIC UNITY MAY BENEFIT MAFIA", "print_headline": "EUROPEANS FEAR '92 ECONOMIC UNITY MAY BENEFIT MAFIA", "body_text": " **********As Italian businessmen eagerly await the new opportunities to be had after Western Europe's economic integration in 1992, law enforcement authorities here dread that some of the biggest benefits will fall to the Mafia and other criminal organizations. **********Their fear is that the scheduled deregulation of European markets, in effect removing national borders for the shipment of goods and capital, will make it much easier for drug traffickers to move their contraband and cash profits with little worry about being caught. **********Concerns about the criminal ramifications of 1992 were firmly planted in the Italian consciousness recently when the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, told a parliamentary committee that the Mafia had billions of dollars ready for ''laundering'' and investment throughout the European Community. Since then, other Italian officials have expressed similar fears in a stream of public speeches and interviews. Money Controls Urged **********''The elimination of borders in Europe is certainly not going to make police efforts any easier,'' said Brig. Gen. Pietro Soggiu, director of the antidrug unit in the Finance Guard, Italy's customs police and tax-collection force. **********It is essential, he and other specialists say, for European countries to pass tough laws to control money flows, and then coordinate their efforts, even to the point of creating a European equivalent to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Otherwise, they say, banks and other financial institutions risk drowning in ''dirty money'' with origins in drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. Appeals at Summit Cited **********Some experts are optimistic that the political will for unified action exists. **********''In the long run it may not be so bad because European countries will be compelled to take strong measures,'' said Pino Arlacchi, a leading Italian authority on Mafia finances. **********One sign of growing sensitivity to the problem was an appeal for a stepped-up war against drugs that was issued by the major industrialized democracies at their summit meeting in Paris last weekend. Among other things, the leaders called for multilateral agreements to help trace and seize drug money and to explore new ways to crack down on money laundering. **********On July 1, the Italian Banking Association began a new anti-Mafia effort by requiring its members to conduct identity checks on anyone depositing or withdrawing more than 10 million lire, about $7,300. Although they say it will take at least a year to tell if the rules work, bank officials call them an effective way to keep track of suspected organized crime money. **********''These people are dealing in billions,'' said a senior Bank of Italy investigator. ''It is not going to be easy for them to break up this amount of money into blocks of 10 million lire. It doesn't work that way.'' **********Skeptics abound, however, and they say the regulations cannot have teeth without supporting legislation. In the United States, they point out, investigators can track suspicious money transactions through a central data gathering unit. In Italy, though, prosecutors are forced to go from bank to bank, and then only when they have a specific individual as their target. **********''They need a systematic accounting for cash transactions, and it's got to be computerized,'' an American official said. That way, he said, ''they can run individual investigations all the way, and see if there are money flows that are inconsistent with regular business or that are consistent with illegal behavior.'' Other Crime Groups Involved **********How much illegal money circulates in Italy is difficult to say. And more than the Mafia is involved, although it is the largest and best-known criminal network. There are equivalent, and similarly lethal, organizations such as the 'Ndrangheta, rooted in Calabria on the toe of Italian boot, and the Naples-based Camorra. **********Kidnapping is a common source of cash, especially for the 'Ndrangheta. In Milan, the police recently announced that they had arrested a courier for the Calabrian group who was said to be carrying a briefcase filled with $280,000 in Italian banknotes. It represented income from at least seven abductions, the authorities said, and apparently was about to be deposited in a bank. **********A study last year by Censis, Italy's state-financed statistics agency, put organized crime's annual revenue at $75 billion, with narcotics the largest income-generator but with extortion, kidnapping, arms sales and fraud also proving lucrative. **********In Sicily, the Mafia has infiltrated many legitimate operations, perhaps most, including the Government. For instance, rake-offs of subsidies from both Rome and the European Community are common. Many Banks in Sicily **********One Western law enforcement official estimated that $20 billion a year is recycled by Italian criminals, much of it through banks and trading companies that are ''as close to home as possible.'' A Turin-based research organization was quoted recently in the Italian press as saying Sicily alone had 600 financial institutions, more than most Italian provinces, even though it lacked ''the industrial or commercial apparatus to justify them.'' **********Late last year, Domenico Sica, Italy's high commissioner against the Mafia, alarmed politicians by declaring that organized criminals had taken ''total possession'' of sections of Sicily, Naples and Calabria. This week, testifying before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Sica cautioned against dismissing the Mafia as merely a local phenomenon. Through drug trafficking and other crimes, he said, it had transformed itself from a rural-based society into ''a national protagonist in the complex context of economic and political life.'' **********A Finance Guard study this spring warned, albeit without supporting statistics, that the Mafia had infiltrated this country's financial system to such a degree that it was capable of provoking a ''hyper-reaction'' that could affect interest and exchange rates. Represented on Stock Exchange **********Mafia money is said to be amply represented in the main stock exchange in Milan, and Interior Minister Antonio Gava caused a stir recently when he reported that ''dirty money'' was also going into treasury bills and certificates. In other words, organized crime is helping the Italian Government underwrite its budget deficit, put at $96.5 billion this year. **********Mr. Gava offered no figures, and much of what he said was not new. Still, it was the first time that a Cabinet minister had publicly acknowledged this Mafia role, and his remarks had a certain shock effect. **********So did even more graphic indicators of organized crime's growing strength, including a bold, but unsuccessful, attempt last month to assassinate the anti-Mafia magistrate in Palermo, Giovanni Falcone. Although Mr. Falcone is one of the most heavily protected men in Italy, someone managed to hide a large bomb behind rocks near his usual vacation swimming spot in Sicily. The bomb was discovered in time, but the magistrate acknowledged later to an Italian newspaper that he had been condemned to die and that ''for the Mafia it's just a question of the right moment.'' **********With growing power and sophistication, criminal organizations are taking their money out of Italy and putting it into European depositories like Switzerland and Luxembourg and even to ''off-shore'' havens in the Caribbean. The Finance Guard study said laundering methods ranged from the simple carrying of banknotes overseas to sophisticated bank transfers. 'Never Did Worry About Laws' **********Because this already is going on, some experts question how much will be changed by the deregulation that 1992 will bring. ''Illegal capital flows have always been there,'' a United States official said. ''These people never did worry about laws. Having borders simply has made it more difficult and cumbersome for them.'' **********Nevertheless, Italian officials are convinced that 1992 will create new challenges, including some not easily foreseen. **********Mr. Arlacchi, the expert on Mafia finances, expressed concern that as major European nations discuss toughening their financial laws, small places like Lichtenstein, Malta and San Marino are loosening their controls to become tax havens. **********''Unfortunately, while the majority in Europe are trying to establish some kind of agreement on dirty money,'' he said, ''there is a small group that is going exactly in the opposite direction.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/business/what-s-new-corporate-youth-programs-keeping-kids-school-mothers-off-welfare.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Towle", "pub_date": "1989-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Keeping Kids in School and Mothers Off Welfare", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN CORPORATE YOUTH PROGRAMS; Keeping Kids in School and Mothers Off Welfare", "body_text": " **********In June, less than an hour before adjourning for the summer, the South Carolina Legislature adopted ''Target 2000: School Reform for the Next Decade.''

Target 2000 hopes to build on those accomplishments by, among other things, providing funds to schools who devise their own improvement plans. **********The South Carolina initiative is the latest in a series of state programs for youngsters backed by business. In South Carolina, corporations paid for a public opinion poll, a media campaign and lobbying efforts to get the bill passed. ''It was all-out warfare getting these packages adopted,'' said Terry Peterson of the Business Education Partnership for Excellence in Education, a task force created by the Legislature to aid the progress of reform. ''Without the efforts of the business community we would not be where we are today.'' **********While states like California and Minnesota have relied on businesses to help pass educational reform measures, South Carolina is the first to actually mandate their continued involvement. The Act created the Business Education Partnership, whose membership is required to reflect a balance of business, civic, education and legislative leaders. **********And it is not just education that businesses and states are teaming up to improve. They are also uniting to promote good health among youngsters. Early this month, Gov. William O'Neill of Connecticut and Denis Mullane, chairman and chief executive officer of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, announced the latest state-level, public-private partnership to prevent drug and alcohol abuse. Its target: ''the state's current and future work force.'' **********The partnership, dubbed ''Drugs Don't Work,'' grew out of a yearlong study that showed that 22 percent of Connecticut's junior high and high school students regularly use drugs and that drug and alcohol abuse among state workers costs Connecticut $2 billion a year in medical expenses, sickness benefits, workers' compensation and lost productivity. **********The state has pledged $1.5 million to the partnership and expects to raise an equal amount from the private sector. Connecticut Mutual has made the first contribution, of $50,000. ''We will emphasize prevention through awareness and education programs in both the workplace and in public schools and universities,'' Mr. Mullane said. **********And the business community in New Jersey has joined with the state to free mothers from welfare in an effort to break the generational pattern of dependance. Known as Reach, short for Realizing Economic Achievement, the program, initiated in late 1987, requires that all able-bodied welfare recipients without children under the age of 2 get a job or enroll in school or a job training program. The state provides a variety of support services to those who do, including child care, transportation and extended Medicaid benefits. Those who do not lose some of their welfare benefits. **********Through industry councils organized in each county - the final one was phased in last month - New Jersey employers organize job training programs and pledge jobs.

Five other counts in the indictment, which was handed up a year ago by a Federal grand jury, will be dropped in return for the pleas. $500,000 Fine Rockwell, based in El Segundo, Calif., faces a maximum fine of $500,000 on the conspiracy charge and an unlimited fine on the contempt charge. A sentencing date is expected to be set at the hearing. **********''In order to maximize the deterrent effect on Rockwell and other defense contractors, we will be seeking a very substantial fine at the time of sentencing,'' said Robert C. Bonner, the United States Attorney in Los Angeles. **********Rockwell and its satellite division could also be suspended or barred from receiving future Government contracts. Pentagon officials said a decision would be made after the guilty pleas were entered. **********The case has focused attention on the Pentagon's efforts to encourage military contractors to police themselves more aggressively and bring forward evidence of fraud. **********Rockwell has maintained since it was indicted a year ago that it should not be prosecuted because it voluntarily turned over to the United States Attorney's office evidence developed in an internal investigation of wrongdoing by several employees. 2 Workers Indicted Two employees were indicted along with Rockwell. Robert Zavodnik, a manager in the company's satellite division, pleaded guilty in September to charges of conspiracy and making false statements. Donald Carter, Mr. Zavodnik's superior, was acquitted of similar charges last month. **********The Justice Department contended that Rockwell provided evidence only after the company became aware that it was under investigation and might be indicted. **********Encouraging military contractors to be more vigilant and forthcoming in exposing fraud has become a more pressing issue in the Pentagon and in the industry in the last several years, particularly in light of the Justice Department's sweeping investigation of bribery and fraud in the Pentagon's procurement process. Rockwell's case is unrelated to that broader investigation, known as ''Operation Ill Wind.'' **********To polish its image and head off stricter legislation, the industry agreed to a suggestion by the Reagan Administration that it adopt a code of voluntary disclosure. Under the code, the Justice Department would consider the company's cooperation in deciding whether to prosecute or what charges to bring. Most major contractors, including Rockwell, have adopted the code. Doubts on Disclosure **********The industry's executives said the Rockwell case had increased doubts among many companies about voluntary disclosure. **********''If companies are not going to be given some kind of credit for voluntarily turning themselves in, they're going to start reviewing, based on legal advice, whether they should participate in that kind of program,'' said Don Fuqua, the president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington-based lobbying group. **********James Neal, one of Rockwell's outside lawyers, said the company's experience in the case would effectively kill the program. ''Any defense contractors crazy enough to participate deserve what they get,'' he said. **********Justice Department officials said the program works effectively when companies abide by its spirit and bring forth information before the Government learns of the possible fraud. They said Rockwell should not have expected to escape indictment, since the Justice Department's investigation was already well under way before the company came forward. Request Denied **********A request by Rockwell last summer that the case be dismissed because of its voluntary cooperation was rejected by a Federal court. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Rockwell will retain the right to appeal on the basis that its voluntary disclosure made prosecution improper. **********The case centers on Rockwell's work in 1982 and 1983 on the Global Positioning System, also known as Navstar. The indictment contended that Rockwell had double-billed the Air Force on $450,000 of the work on the contracts. The indictment also said the company had attempted to cover up the overbilling by misleading Pentagon auditors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Stead", "pub_date": "1989-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Coach Leatherware Co., to Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners, with an undisclosed budget. *********** Tropworld Casino and Entertainment Resort, Atlantic City, to Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro, with a budget of $10 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/business/the-media-business-advertising-ciociola-company-wins-remco-account.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Ciociola & Company Wins Remco Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Ciociola & Company Wins Remco Account", "body_text": " **********It's still looking a lot like Christmas at Ciociola & Company, which has won the $2 million to $5 million Remco Toys account, and at Bohbot Communications, which has been called on to handle media planning and buying for the $12 million Matchbox Toys USA account. **********Ciociola, five years old, was a toy agency before but took a two-year breather.

Different Plans for Future **********And with the pace of the campaign accelerating as the Jan. 16 vote nears, the very different plans the two contestants have for the exchange's future are becoming increasingly clear. **********Mr. Rosenthal, the underdog, is running an aggressive campaign, the likes of which have not been seen before in the clubby world of the exchange. Typically, its elections are rubber-stamp affairs, with the candidate endorsed by the nominating committee - as Mr. Mahlmann is this time - assured of victory. **********Mr. Rosenthal has passed out attractively designed brochures, proclaiming his campaign motto, ''MVP - maximum value plan.'' His proposals include introducing a bevy of new financial instruments and selling off the exchange's landmark Art Deco building and distributing all or part of the proceeds to the members. Rise From $377,000 Seen **********With his ''radical restructuring'' program, Mr. Rosenthal asserts that he can sharply increase the incomes of members so that the price of a seat on the exchange will jump to roughly $670,000, up from $377,000 recently, which marked a steady decline from the August 1987 record high of $550,000. **********Whatever the outcome of the campaign, industry analysts agree that exchange politics have changed for good. ''The days when elections were not contested may be a thing of the past,'' said a Chicago commodities attorney, Karen M. Dorff, noting a recent hard-fought race at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades in future and options in cattle, hogs, pork bellies and such financial instruments as foreign exchange, Treasury bills, Eurodollars and stock index futures. **********Plainly, outside political pressure has played a significant role in the current election battle. ''The whole thing is colored by the fact that the Chicago Board of Trade and the whole futures industry is under immense pressure in Washington,'' said James A. McGurk, a commodities attorney in Chicago. Pressure for More Regulation **********Mr. Mahlmann has been criticized for not showing enough initiative in defending the exchange against the charges that have plagued the futures industry this year. There has been mounting pressure for increased regulation of Chicago's futures exchanges in the wake of a Federal investigation into fraud in the commodities industry. **********The 52-year-old Mr. Mahlmann is seeking another term on the ground that the exchange needs consistent leadership to guide it through a difficult period. ''There is a need for continuity,'' he said. ''At stake is the very way we do business.'' **********Still, some question whether Mr. Mahlmann will be an effective advocate for the exchange. ''It is absolutely clear that the floor brokers stand to really take it on the chin from Congress,'' said Frederick L. White, an attorney formerly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, referring to proposed legislation that calls for stricter oversight of the futures industry. 'Too Much of a Compromiser' **********Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is championing a bill calling for an overhaul of trading practices and for increasing regulatory oversight of traders. ''Perhaps the floor brokers are searching for a strong leader who is going to find a way to stem the tide,'' Mr. White said. ''I wouldn't be surprised if they felt that Cash is too much of a compromiser to really do it.'' **********Mr. Rosenthal's past, however, may not make him an ideal candidate to testify before Congressional committees concerned with abuses in the futures industry. After a case that dragged on for 10 years, in 1984, Mr. Rosenthal and five associates were fined a total of $30,000 by the commodity commission for reportedly defrauding customers. **********Mr. Rosenthal's record could weigh against him with traders looking for a chairman that will come across well in Washington. ''It is awfully hard for him to testify and not get criticized,'' Mr. White said. No Admission of Wrongdoing **********Mr. Rosenthal said the fine would not damage his effectiveness as a regulator. ''I was never found guilty of anything,'' he said. ''It was a settlement,'' he added, noting that in agreeing to pay the fine, he did not admit to any wrongdoing. He said that customers involved in the 1975 case ended up making a great deal of money. **********At the center of the campaign is Mr. Rosenthal's flamboyant proposal to sell the exchange's building. Mr. Rosenthal, who served as chairman in 1981 and 1982, estimates that the 1930 building, which is in the heart of Chicago's financial district on LaSalle Street, could be sold for as much as $400 million. **********Following Mr. Rosenthal's proposal last month, the directors of the exchange quickly hired three real estate experts to appraise the building. **********Even at today's higher prices, an outright sale appears unlikely because of the sizable tax liability on the income from selling the building. Earlier this year, the sale of another Chicago landmark, the Sears Tower, fell through, in part because of concern over the huge tax liability the sale would create. Sears, Roebuck & Company ultimately refinanced the tower using a convertible mortgage, one of the options now under consideration for the exchange's building. **********A former official said that Mr. Rosenthal's proposal to cash in on the building and distribute the profits to members was likely to have great appeal to the ''fast-buck mentality'' of many traders. To illustrate the point, he recalled being told by a trader: ''We really need some long-range planning. We need to think about where we are going to be in six months.'' **********Indeed, in a recent campaign mailing, Mr. Rosenthal tempts floor traders by noting that the sale could result in a $196,000 payment to each of the approximately 1,500 members. **********As another way of improving profits, Mr. Rosenthal proposes introducing a new family of insurance futures contracts. But the handling of new contracts during Mr. Rosenthal's last stint as the chairman has made some traders wary of the 56-year-old trader this time around. ''I have concerns,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified, noting that an ''overly aggressive expansion'' of memberships and new products in the early 1980's depressed the value of exchange seats for a while. **********In this campaign, however, Mr. Rosenthal has stated that creating new memberships is not a part of his program. **********Both candidates began as runners on the floor of the exchange in the late 1950's. In April, for the first time, the exchange's directors authorized a ''retainer'' for the chairman, set at $240,000 annually. ''These are individuals who are forgoing the opportunity to perhaps make substantially more than that in a good year,'' said Mr. McGurk, the commodities attorney."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/business/why-they-smile-at-red-lobster.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas McGill", "pub_date": "1989-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2613, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Why They Smile at Red Lobster", "print_headline": "Why They Smile at Red Lobster", "body_text": " **********The scene, at a Red Lobster restaurant that opened recently here, is a cross between a pep rally and a pop quiz. A large room is filled with raucous students learning the basics of their trade - waiting on tables. Their enthusiastic teacher raises his clenched fists over his head, fires off questions and exhorts his students to answer as loudly as they can: **********''What's the first thing we do at the table?'' ''SMILE!'' booms the class.  ''And the second thing?'' ''SAY SOMETHING PERSONAL!'' ''And the third thing?'' ''DESCRIBE THE SPECIAL FEATURES!'' ''Very good! And what will be our vegetables of the month?'' ''BROCCOLI AND CARROTS!'' comes the roaring reply.  And so, in a burst of energy, begins a new Red Lobster restaurant, the latest eating house to be added to the world's largest - and still rapidly growing - seafood restaurant chain. Red Lobster was started with a single restaurant in Florida in 1968 and since 1970 when it was bought by General Mills Inc. it has grown explosively. It now includes 513 restaurants in this country, Canada and Japan, with sales in North America of $1.13 billion last year. **********While General Mills provided the financial clout that fueled Red Lobster's growth, industry experts attribute its success to something more fundamental: innovation. With the eating and working patterns and dietary foibles of the American public in continuous flux, Red Lobster has found, and in some cases created, the techniques it needed to stay a step ahead. **********''They have a machine in place for expansion,'' said Timothy Ramey, a food industry analyst for County NatWest USA, a brokerage firm. ''They have a concept that works extremely well, but they also constantly refresh their franchise. Red Lobster today looks nothing like Red Lobster five years ago. They'll throw in mesquite grills and then take them out. If Cajun food is hot, they'll put five Cajun entrees on the menu. Whatever's hot, they do it.'' **********The hottest feature at Red Lobster today, however, is not a menu item - nor even the restaurant's reasonable prices (the average dinner check is around $11), their large selection (more than 100 seafood items on the menu), or the restaurant's clean, tasteful decor. **********No, the big ticket item at Red Lobster today is, simply, good service, as in having your waiter greet you with a smile, ask you a friendly question and tell you about the vegetables of the day. To insure good service, the restaurant mounts a four-day training course for servers before each restaurant opens, and thereafter requires its staff to attend monthly classes to polish skills and learn new trends in salad presentation, garnishing techniques and the like. **********Trainees are not let off easy. At the training program here, every minute of every session was taken up in classes, trial runs, quizzes and contests. On the first day the students were given homework (to memorize the entire menu) and the next morning were given a written test on the material (the highest scorer won $100). There was a contest to see who could use the computer the fastest, and another to determine which server was best at describing desserts accurately, temptingly and entertainingly. **********Some of the seminars taught precisely the phrases to be used in such presentations. Judy Limbach, for instance, taught a class on entree items. She circled a long table covered with every main dish on the menu, which she picked up, one by one, and described in detail. **********When she put down the last dish, she walked back to the first one, picked it up and commenced a surprise quiz. ''Now that I've told you about the dishes, now you can tell me about them,'' she began, smiling dryly at the worried faces that flashed through her class. ''Chris, tell me about the popcorn shrimp.'' **********''Popcorn shrimp,'' said Chris, stammering, blanching. ''Oh . . . it's shrimp . . . and it's, ahh, it's popcorn-sized, and . . .'' **********''It's bite sized, lightly breaded and golden fried,'' Judy corrected quickly. ''You need to know this, honey. You need to describe it so it sounds really good.'' **********Like every detail in a Red Lobster restaurant, the particulars of the service are the result of Red Lobster's careful scrutiny of surveys and interviews that tell them exactly what their consumers want. The surveys are conducted both by outside polling agencies and by Red Lobster itself, which runs several regular surveys. One is a bimonthly polling, in different restaurants, of 34,600 people on the quality of their ''dining experience.'' Another is a monthly mailing to 40,000 consumers that rates Red Lobster against 15 competitors. Still other surveys help determine the success of new products and other special projects. **********What makes service so important today, industry experts say, is that after several decades of steady growth in the number and types of restaurants, a saturation point has been reached. Good food at reasonable prices is relatively common, and most people eating out can choose between a great variety of regional and foreign styles. The competition has thus shifted to service. **********Eating out ''has become a kind of sport, an entertainment,'' explained Peter Romeo, an editor at Nation's Restaurant News, a trade journal. ''Consumers have become a lot more savvy. They know what good service is, and if you don't give it, the competition is so intense that you'll be knocked out of business for good.'' **********Polls and surveys have pinpointed the role that service, either good or bad, plays in a diner's decision to eat out: It is a leading reason why a person decides to return to a restaurant, or to shun it thereafter. **********A Gallup survey in 1987, for instance, found that ''good service'' was virtually never a reason why people choose to go to a restaurant for the first time. The two most frequently cited reasons for that were ''recommended by a friend'' (44 percent) and ''curiosity'' (20 percent.) Quality of service, on the other hand, was the second most cited reason why a person would either return to, or avoid, a restaurant. In the Gallup poll, 63 percent said they would not return to a restaurant because of bad service, compared with 65 percent because of the quality of food and 15 percent because of high prices. **********''What it all boils down to is your experience with the server,'' explained Phil Pritchard, Red Lobster's executive vice president in charge of restaurant operations. ''I have a dry cleaner where I have my shirts done, and they don't exactly do my shirts the way I think they ought to. But I like them, personally, and that's why I have my shirts done there. It's the people, almost every time.'' **********In response to such data and observations, Red Lobster completely overhauled its table-service procedures in 1986. The new techniques were borrowed wholesale from restaurants that made service a specialty: the ritzy ''Would-you-like-some-fresh-ground-pepper-with-your-salad?'' sort of place. **********Today, every Red Lobster customer gets the full-service treatment: an oral recitation of the day's special selections, a fresh ground pepper option and a selection of desserts brought to the table after dinner. **********Most crucially, post-1986, all Red Lobster waiters and waitresses are encouraged, during training, to show a bit of their personality while meeting customers. The old Red Lobster uniform of shirts and slacks has been discarded in favor of a maroon apron, under which servers can wear clothing of their choice. And while stock descriptive phrases are taught in the seminars, the servers are encouraged to improvise their sales pitch. **********''We try to remove the spiel and inject the personality,'' explained Jeff O'Hara, president of Red Lobster USA. ''We're trying to bring it down to an intensely personal experience.'' **********The company is also well known among waiters and waitresses, in most areas where it is found, as a good employer that offers solid benefits, a chance for advancement and flexible hours. Most of all, it is known as a restaurant where the tipping is good. At the recent training course here, many students spoke of their hope to make more than $100 in tips on good nights. **********While several fast-food restaurants are larger than Red Lobster - McDonald's had 10,513 restaurants worldwide and did $16 billion in sales last year - the General Mills restaurant chain is the largest that offers table service and a full lunch and dinner menu. In 1988, each of its 402 stores in the United States did average weekly sales of $51,000, with a total yearly business for the chain in this country of $1.06 billion. **********Other leading ''dinnerhouse'' chains include Bennigan's, whose 210 stores did $450 million in annual sales in 1988, and Chi Chi's, a Mexican dinnerhouse, with 190 restaurants and $470 million in annual sales last year, according to Howard Hansen, a restaurant industry analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. Red Lobster is the second largest revenue-producing unit of General Mills, behind its cereals division; the restaurant's 1988 sales were about one-fifth of the company's total $5 billion business that year. **********Innovation in areas besides service also helped to fuel Red Lobster's climb to the top of the dinnerhouse restaurant business, experts say. Those innovations have occurred gradually since 1970, as executives coped with the challenges of expanding into a worldwide chain. **********''We believe there is a science to running dinnerhouse restaurants,'' said Joe R. Lee, the 48-year-old president of General Mills restaurants, which also owns a smaller restaurant chain, the Olive Garden. ''We believe there is a science to determining consumer needs, and a science to answering those needs, in a disciplined manner, on a massive scale.'' **********Experts in the industry largely credit Mr. Lee with providing the vision that has guided Red Lobster's growth, after its purchase by General Mills in 1970. In his turn, Mr. Lee was a protege of a legendary restaurateur, Bill Darden, who opened the first Red Lobster in 1968 in Lakeland, Fla. At the time, the Red Lobster was only one of a number of highly popular Florida and Georgia restaurants created by Mr. Darden. **********A Red Lobster supervisor when the company was bought by General Mills, Mr. Lee combined his nuts-and-bolts knowledge of the business with the marketing resources of General Mills to forge the chain's growth strategy. From the beginning, he has championed a warm approach to customers and a cold approach to numbers. **********In the early 1970's, he recalls carrying a slide rule with him everywhere to calculate prices, portion weights and all other quantifiable elements of the business. Red Lobster employees recall that he also carried a thermometer to check the temperature of entrees before they were served. **********When Red Lobster expanded with General Mills' help, Mr. Lee realized that more than a slide rule was needed to keep track of numbers on a mass scale. In the early 1970's, he saw the need for a centralized data system, to tally the daily business of all Red Lobster stores. **********The major computer companies had no suitable system, however, so Red Lobster approached AMF Inc., whose machines tallied bowling scores, and had them custom-make a system for the chain. Today, an I.B.M. computer has replaced the AMF, allowing executives in Orlando headquarters to determine, up to the minute, the precise amount of business at a given restaurant, including which items sell well - or poorly. **********The company's most significant innovation, though, has been the system it devised for acquiring seafood on a worldwide scale. Today, Red Lobster is in essence a fisher of the world's oceans, buying about 58 million pounds of seafood a year. It has a worldwide network of buyers who constantly look for ''underutilized species'' that could become the next fad food for an American public always looking for something new. **********Popcorn shrimp, fished off the shores of Brazil, is one such product that Red Lobster helped to popularize in this country. Currently, the restaurant's daily menu includes more than 100 seafood items, including slipper lobster, a crayfish-like lobster from Thailand, and Pacific orange roughy, a whitefish, both relatively new to the American palate. **********''Our product is hunted, not raised,'' said Jeff O'Hara. ''We have to go and catch our product, and there is never a guarantee, from week to week, that we can catch what we're hoping to catch.'' **********The key to the Red Lobster purchasing system is that direct contact between its buyers and the fishermen protects it against such risks. When one species of seafood falls short, because of bad weather or oil spills or whatever, a replacement from another fisherman can quickly be found. **********Kress Muenzmay, Red Lobster's senior vice president for purchasing, took out a yellow pad and drew an ''S'' with a circle around it. **********''That's the sea,'' he said, then drawing a line of dots just around the edge of the circle. ''And this is where our buyers are, as close as they can get to the product. Fish isn't any better than the minute it comes out of the water, so the closer the better. **********''There are thousands of entrepreneurial fishing operations out there,'' he added, ''and our buyers' main job is building relationships with them, understanding quality and environmental issues, having a working knowledge of regulations and a good understanding of the market. To do that requires more than most companies are willing to devote.'' **********The competitive benefits that the system brings Red Lobster, however, are tremendous, including a menu selection that virtually no other seafood chain restaurant can match. By using overnight air express services like the Emery Air Freight Corporation - which offers Red Lobster a high-volume discount rate - any Red Lobster restaurant in the United States can offer a choice of fresh fish, ranging from Maine flounder to Alaskan salmon. **********For all that, however, Red Lobster executives still insist that service, in today's world, provides the ultimate competitive edge. It continues to watch its polls and surveys carefully, to spot the latest consumer desires at the very moment they occur. **********Some things, though, are just plain common sense, as David Longest, a Red Lobster regional vice president, noted during the last session of the last day of the training program here. **********There was general pandemonium, as the trainers clapped and whistled, getting all the trainees to their feet. Amid loud cheers, a man in a bright red lobster suit, like a mascot at a football game, walked into the crowd and raised a giant claw. It was clearly the symbolic moment at which the trainees became full-fledged Red Lobster servers, and the group let out a roar. **********Mr. Longest stood back a bit and explained the function of all the fun: ''If you don't keep them happy, they're not going to keep the guests happy. So, we keep them happy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/21/business/finance-new-issues-kodak-offering-is-increased.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak Offering Is Increased", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Kodak Offering Is Increased", "body_text": " **********The Eastman Kodak Company is offering $300 million in notes due in 2004 through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.

In doing so, First Union would nearly double its operations in Florida and become the state's second-largest bank. **********Florida, whose rapid growth and large pool of retirees' savings have made it one of the nation's most attractive banking markets, has allowed banks from nearby states to move in but has kept its doors closed to others. **********Chemical Bank, which since 1984 has had an option to buy Florida National, had apparently given up hope of receiving state legislative approval before the option expired next year, and sold its interest to First Union. Chemical's pretax profit will be $115 million, analysts said. Real Estate Loan Losses **********Losses in real estate lending have weakened Florida National's earnings in recent years, but First Union officials said they could compensate by cutting costs at the bank's 185 branches, which have 5,000 employees. J. Robert Lee, First Union's chief financial officer, estimated that by 1993, the merger would save $40 million, or 70 cents a share. In 1988, First Union earned $297 million, or $2.76 a share. **********First Union now has 215 branches in the state, and the combination with Florida National's network will create a bank with about $17 billion in assets, second in the state to Barnett Banks Inc. Over all, First Union will have about $37 billion in assets. **********''Florida is a very attractive market, and there is a good argument that this acquisition makes strategic sense,'' said Gerry L. O'Meara, an analyst at the Robinson-Humphrey Company, a securities firm in Atlanta. He added that the $34.9 million earned by Florida National in 1988 ''is nowhere near its potential'' as the bank recovers from bad real estate loans made when it was expanding rapidly earlier in this decade. Substantial Costs **********The analysts do not doubt that First Union, one of the nation's strongest regional banking companies, will be able to cut costs after the acquisition.

He did not elaborate, but the comment was widely regarded as a hint that he might advance national elections, which are not scheduled for three years. **********Preliminary returns from the election Sunday in 2,000 cities and towns showed the ruling Motherland Party trailing far behind both the Social Democratic Populist Party on the left and the True Path Party on the right. Trouble in Big Cities **********Mr. Ozal's troubles were underlined in Turkey's big cities, where his party has controlled the city halls. Incumbents appeared to be headed for defeat in Ankara, the capital, and in Izmir, a western port city. Mayor Bedrettin Dalan of Istanbul, a rising star in the ruling camp, was only slightly behind in early vote counting, but opinion polls had predicted he would win easily. **********''The situation does not look good,'' Oltan Sungurlu, the Motherland Party deputy chairman, told the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency. **********The local results do not affect Mr. Ozal's hold on the national Government or the commanding parliamentary majority of his party, a centrist-conservative coalition that is strongly pro-Western and that has made membership in the Common Market a basic goal. **********But the opposition cast the election as a referendum on Mr. Ozal's performance in the last six years, and many Turks viewed it the same way. The Prime Minister's personal popularity has dropped sharply in recent months, reflecting widespread unhappiness over galloping inflation and Mr. Ozal's growing tendency to depend on a few close advisers, many of them relatives. **********''It's clear the voters are sending him a message,'' a Western diplomat said. Possibility of Defections **********At the least, Mr. Ozal will almost certainly have to abandon hopes that he is believed to have had of becoming Turkey's President when the post becomes vacant in November. A Cabinet shake-up seems imminent as well. **********Several commentators said that if the early trends continued, the Prime Minister could even run the risk of party defections, raising the possibility of a significant political realignment in coming weeks. **********Violence between supporters of rival parties reportedly left 2 people shot dead and at least 35 hurt in eastern provinces, but for the most part the elections were orderly. **********Near the end of the campaign, Mr. Ozal tried to depict a defeat of his party as a disaster for Turkey. **********''Dark forces'' are out to destroy the country, he said, warning that an opposition victory would bring a return to the political violence of the 1970's that helped bring an army coup in 1980. **********In 1983, the military yielded to a civilian Government headed by Mr. Ozal, a technocrat-turned-politician who emphasized high growth and a gradual easing of economic controls. **********Inflation was the price of rapid development, he said.

The Bush Administration has selected James R. Cheek, a diplomat honored by the State Department for his work in Nicaragua; he had been moved to Nepal by the Reagan Administration.

By this they mean that attempts are made to persuade one side to agree to a certain food relief operation so that the other side will feel embarrassed and concede. **********So far, both sides have agreed to food deliveries to Government- and rebel-held areas. **********But Mr. Cohen is understood to have told the Sudanese Prime Minister, Sadiq al-Mahdi, that the Government has put up too many obstacles to the relief efforts. **********In the wake of the failed coup in Ethiopia almost three weeks ago, diplomats said President Mengistu continued to consolidate his power, at least in the short term, by bringing in a new set of generals known for their loyalty.

Michael D. Forzley, the founder, president and publisher of the Portland, Ore., publication, said 82 percent of the teachers who receive the tabloid through their schools use it as part of required exercises.

Time Inc., for example, recently inaugurated a Sports Illustrated for Kids, which donates 250,000 issues to schools with low-income children. **********Last month, Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., started a pilot program that gives $50,000 worth of video equipment to six schools provided that each requires students to watch the news programs. Educators have criticized the plan, arguing that students should not be captive audiences to advertising. **********Publications have generally drawn less criticism from educators. ''Children need to read a lot,'' said Patricia Albjerg Graham, dean of the Harvard School of Education. ''Print promotes literacy better than television promotes literacy.'' **********She also said that print ads are much easier to disregard than television ads. ''The most important thing is that you can turn the page,'' she said. ''You can't do that with TV.'' **********But Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, a Boston-based group that monitors commercials for children, argues that mixing print advertising and education is not always wise. **********''If the school takes the publication and sends it home with the student, that's a good thing,'' she said. ''But if it's required reading, it's disgusting.'' She said ads then ''become part of the school's message.'' **********For his part, Mr. Forzley said he had turned down several ads that he deemed inappropriate. He said his publication offers more educational benefits than harm. **********With a zesty brand of ''kid journalism,'' featuring upbeat writing, colorful graphics, a snazzy layout and full-page ads, Young American tries to interest students in the printed word. ''We believe strongly that the love of reading leads to a love of learning,'' Mr. Forzley said. The publication, which is privately owned by Mr. Forzley, his wife, Kristina T. Linden, and a handful of investors, also has its business advantages. ''It's a tremendous and powerful market called kids,'' Mr. Forzley said. **********''We began to see that kids have between $40 and $60 billion'' in spending power, he said. ''They begin to develop buying and spending habits early.'' **********Advertisers can buy full-page ads for $59,000. A full-page ad in Sports Illustrated for Kids costs an average of $25,000. Sears an Advertiser **********The inaugural issue contained a full-page color ad for clothes from Sears, Roebuck. It also included a full-page color clothing ad bought by Gitano Group Inc., a New York-based sportswear manufacturer, and a science column called ''Bill Nye, the Science Guy,'' sponsored by Dow Chemical.

And as more of the new pilots enter the airline's cockpits, Eastern must be concerned about pairing inexperienced pilots on the same flight. **********The airline must also contemplate how to deal with tensions in the cockpit that could compromise safety if the striking pilots eventually return to work and have to fly with their colleagues who crossed the picket lines. Starting Pay Is Lower **********''Eastern will be able to get the pilots it needs, but it will have a tough sell,'' said Kit Darby, executive vice president of the Future Aviation Professionals of America, a career-information service. **********Indeed, flying for Eastern is not every pilot's dream. Starting pay falls short of that at other airlines and a cloud of uncertainty still hangs over the carrier, which is seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. **********Eastern has dispatched recruiters to small airports, offering a $1,000 bonus to those who successfully complete training. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents the striking pilots, responded by publishing a 35-page booklet intended to disuade pilots from joining Eastern. The booklet criticized the carrier's management and warned the new pilots that their jobs would be in jeopardy should the strike be settled. **********So far, the carrier has received 2,500 applications, of which 1,500 meet its minimum qualifications. Among the requirements are a commercial pilot's license and 1,200 hours of flight time. '87 Crash Recalled **********With a flood of new pilots, Eastern faces the tricky logistical problem of insuring that inexperienced pilots are not teamed on the same flight. The problem gained national attention after the 1987 crash of a Continental Airlines plane during a Denver snowstorm. Both pilots on the plane were relatively inexperienced. Continental, which like Eastern is owned by the Texas Air Corporation, had gone through a period of hiring new pilots after the airline declared bankruptcy and abrogated its unions' contracts. **********Since the Continental accident, the Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to insure that at least one veteran pilot is in the cockpit on every flight. With the majority of Eastern's pilots new to the carrier, that could prove problematic. **********A more nettlesome problem would emerge should the strike be settled and the union pilots return to work. There is a distinct potential for conflict between veteran pilots and the replacement pilots. ''It would be a very serious problem that would have to be managed closely,'' said Phil Bakes, Eastern's president. **********Eastern executives are mindful that difficulties still linger at United Airlines from a 1985 pilots' strike. Those hired to replace striking pilots, and who remained at the airline after the walkout was settled, say they continue to be harassed by members of the pilots' association. **********Meanwhile at Eastern, the pilots' association has accused the airline of hiring unqualified pilots in its rush to fill cockpit seats. While a few of Eastern's recruits had been charged with violations of Federal air rules, none of the reported offenses are serious, the airline said, and therefore would not disqualify a pilot from flying an airliner. 'Every Conceivable Scrutiny' **********Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman, said that the airline conducts thorough background investigations of pilot candidates and that any violations are judged on an individual basis. ''We're under every conceivable scrutiny,'' she said. ''We're not about to cut corners.'' **********An F.A.A. official, Anthony J. Broderick, said the agency was closely monitoring Eastern's pilot training program, but declined to comment further. ''It's a labor-management dispute and we don't want to get dragged into the middle,'' he said. **********Of Eastern's first class of 34 pilots, who began training in early April, two dropped out for personal reasons, three were dismissed because of information uncovered during their background check and five failed to pass the requisite examinations, said Frank Causey, Eastern's vice president of flight operations. High Attrition Rate **********The 30 percent attrition rate is considerably higher than that at other major airlines. An instructor with United, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, called 30 percent an alarming number. ''If that happened at United, we would be revamping the program,'' he said. Eastern's attrition rate has since improved but remains above the industry average of about 5 percent. **********Despite the large-scale hiring, Eastern maintains that its training program is on schedule. **********''There are always some start-up problems in a program that's been dormant for a while,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ''But we're right where we want to be.'' **********The pilots hired by Eastern are considerably older - and in many cases more experienced - than those hired by other carriers, most of which prefer younger pilots. The new pilots at Eastern average nearly 40 years of age, compared with 33 years for the industry. One of the new Eastern pilots is 54. Federal regulations require that a pilot retire at 60. **********''A lot of the people who are coming here are people that American Airlines wouldn't hire,'' Mr. Bakes said. ''But it's not because they're inexperienced.'' Experience Described **********Pilots in the first class hired by Eastern had, on average, 5,700 hours of flight time, nearly double the national average for major airlines. But the figure is skewed by the high number of flight hours logged by a few pilots. Some of the new pilots have considerably less experience. For instance, Wes Orlob, the manager of Eastern's operations in Seattle who recently accepted a pilot's position, has not worked as a full-time pilot since 1976. With 1,200 hours of flight time, Mr. Orlob barely met Eastern's minimum requirements. **********For the older pilots, a job at Eastern allows them to bypass years of working as a flight engineer - a cockpit position viewed as a stepping stone to a co-pilot's or captain's slot. Eastern is one of the few major airlines hiring pilots directly for the more prestigious jobs. **********Many of the newly hired pilots said they were willing to cope with the uncertainty at Eastern in hopes of rapidly advancing to the captain's seat. ''At American Airlines, I'd start as a flight engineer regardless of my qualifications,'' said Royal Drews, a former Navy pilot and more recently a financial analyst and commuter-airline pilot, who was hired by Eastern as a co-pilot. 'A Golden Opportunity' **********''I'll be a captain in two or three years,'' said Richard Knight, a 42-year-old pilot. ''At my age it's a golden opportunity.'' **********Some are philosophical about the uncertainty. ''In this business there's insecurity no matter where you go,'' said Paul Van Baalen, another pilot. ''If you want job security you might as well not fly.'' **********Starting pay at Eastern is $1,450 a month - about 24 percent below the industry average. In addition to a $1,000 bonus for completing the eight-week training course, Eastern is offering the new pilots $3,000 at the end of a one-year probation period. **********The airline's search for pilots comes at a time when other airlines are hiring a record number of them, about 4,000 last year. Still, airlines like United and American hire only one of every six applicants. Eastern in its new program has hired about one out of five. **********In their search for qualified applicants, Eastern's recruiters visited small flight schools like Omni Aviation in Danvers, Mass. ''Since 1972 I have not seen a major carrier walk into a small flight school and ask pilots if they want to fly for them,'' said Victor Capozzi, general manager of the school. ''No one was taking them seriously. I felt sorry for them.'' **********Mr. Bakes justified Eastern's aggresive recruiting. ''This wasn't the case of I.B.M. saying it needed a few more programmers,'' he said. ''We were in the middle of a strike and we needed pilots.'' **********Meanwhile, the pilots' union has begun a campaign to disuade pilots from joining Eastern. At hotels where Eastern is housing its recruits, the union has set up hospitality suites, offering free food and advice. 'Sympathy for the Strikers' **********Some young pilots are heeding the union's advice. ''There's a lot of sympathy for the strikers,'' said Michael Sterling, a pilot for Cav Air Express, a charter company based in Houston. Mr. Sterling, who meets Eastern's requirements, said he would not work for the beleaguered airline, adding, ''Anyone who crosses a union picket line is branded for life.'' **********Some of the newly hired pilots have accused the union of using intimidation. A recent visitor to Eastern's headquarters in Miami was jeered by two picketing pilots as he drove past the entrance. A recently hired pilot, Candace McRae, said she was threatened by 10 union pilots at the Atlanta airport. Ron Cole, a spokesman for the pilots' union, denied the charge."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/11/business/company-news-mark-iv-to-sell-unit-to-dutch.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mark IV to Sell Unit to Dutch", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Mark IV to Sell Unit to Dutch", "body_text": " **********Mark IV Industries agreed today to sell its rubber subsidiary to a Dutch company for $242.5 million and plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt incurred when it acquired the Armtek Corporation in October.

Yershov was a young Soviet general serving as second-in-command of the Warsaw Pact forces that invaded Czechoslovakia. **********In 1976, he proved his loyalty to the Communist Party by refusing to sign a document that would have allowed his 22-year-old daughter to join her emigre husband in the United States. **********In 1982, shocked by his daughter's hunger strike, he relented and began a confrontation with the state that cost him his commission, his Communist Party post, his privileges - everything but his pension and his party card. **********Now, at the age of 68, General Yershov is visiting the United States, helping his daughter celebrate her new American citizenship and seeing a bit of the country he once viewed as the enemy. Journey Comes Full Circle **********He has come full circle in the agonizing journey that began on the Czechoslovak border that day in 1968, when he locked away his disturbing initial conclusion that ''this glorious mission to save socialism was a lie.'' It is a fable of glasnost that epitomizes the wrenching changes for a generation of older Soviet citizens, the survivors of Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev for whom the flowering of political discourse has an especially personal quality. **********As he sat in his son-in-law's book-lined study on Tuesday, the general crossed an invisible line, talking to a reporter for the first time to put his private thoughts into public record. He leaned forward, rested the elbows of his plaid wool jacket on his knees and gripped a pen in his gnarled hands. **********''Our nation must openly renounce our actions in 1968,'' he said. ''Eleven years after Prague, our forces went into Afghanistan in just the same way. It periodically occurs, and we need a guarantee that it does not happen again. We need to say Czechoslovakia was a mistake, just as we did about Afghanistan.'' **********His black hair thinning and turning gray, General Yershov still has a soldier's bearing and the gentle, almost shy, formality typical of his generation. **********General Yershov and his wife arrived in the United States last Thursday to visit his daughter, Tatiana Lozansky, and her husband, Edward, a physicist and mathematician who now works as an educational consultant. Reception on Capitol Hill **********On Thursday they are scheduled to join Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, and others who helped Mr. Lozansky fight for his wife's right to emigrate. A reception will be held on Capitol Hill to mark General Yershov's long-awaited visit and his daughter's recent naturalization. **********General Yershov spoke enthusiastically about his impressions: ''I wanted to see America with my own eyes. As a military man, my impression was of a strong military power that was the first to create and use the atom bomb. Now, I see America as a rich and enlightened country.'' **********He spoke admiringly of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a man of ''great courage.'' But, outlining his own, sometimes radical prescriptions for reform, he said the Communist Party should relinquish power and allow opposition parties. **********He also questioned Mr. Gorbachev's condemnation of previous Soviet leaders. ''Gorbachev and some of the others held major posts in those years and did nothing to get things started earlier,'' he said. ''Where were they?'' **********The general nodded reflectively as the same question was put to him. ''I acted as a soldier,'' he said. ''I had to learn how to act as a father.'' Met Americans in World War II **********In some ways, General Yershov's political evolution began in May 1945, in the meeting of Soviet and American forces on the Elbe River in Germany. ''I remember the embraces, the salutes, the toasts,'' he said. ''We exchanged gifts and we thought it was a simple soldierly act. Afterward, when we went back to camp, there was the K.G.B. asking for explanations. Some careers suffered.'' **********But in those days, he said, ''We didn't think about these things. The country was rebuilding and the military was desperately trying to catch up with the United States atomic program.'' **********Twenty-three years later, as a two-star general, he was chosen as second-in-command to Gen. Ivan G. Pavlovsky in the Warsaw Pact forces sent to crush the liberalizing Prague spring in Czechoslovakia. **********''We were told we were going to destroy counterrevolutionary forces, and that is what we believed,'' General Yershov said. ''We went in with artillery and tanks, and we thought we were responding to a cry for help from the Czechoslovak people.'' **********He paused and continued: ''As soon as we crossed the border, we saw it was not true. There were no people to greet us. On the contrary, the roads were spread with oil to stop our tanks. Every road sign was destroyed, removed or turned in the wrong direction. Simple people had covered the roads with three-pronged devices to puncture our tires. They were terrified of our arrival.'' **********But General Yershov did not want to jeopardize his career, perhaps even his life, and he continued to advance in the military. By 1972, when his daughter married Mr. Lozansky, he was chief of staff of the Kiev Military District, a member of the Presidium of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and a member of the Kiev Regional Party Committee. He later became a three-star general. 'I Asked Him Not to Go' **********When Mr. Lozansky decided to emigrate, General Yershov said, ''I was unhappy. I argued with him. I asked him not to go. He left.'' **********At first, he thought his daughter and granddaughter, Tania, now 17, could be happy without Mr. Lozansky. ''But their love was a higher thing, and Tatiana began to fight to leave,'' he said. ''People told me, 'You're a Communist, don't allow her to go.' At first, I went along. **********''Then, in 1982, I understood that she was willing to do anything, even die, to go to her husband,'' he said. ''That changed everything. I didn't want my daughter to become a casualty.'' **********General Yershov said he was astonished at how quickly things changed. ''I was a good Communist and soldier one day,'' he said, ''and the next my comrades, with whom I had worked and drunk vodka and laughed, looked at me with different eyes.'' **********He was removed from his posts and given a ''strong censure'' by the Communist Party. He eventually was forced into retirement. **********Now, General Yershov and his daughter said, the pain and anger of those years has faded. ''I am not going to say I approve of what she did,'' he said. ''I am a citizen of my country in the highest sense of the word, but she is an adult who makes her own choices.'' **********Mrs. Lozansky still cannot bring herself to talk about her struggle to emigrate. ''I just want to say that I knew he wouldn't let me die in Moscow,'' she said. ''Somehow inside, I knew it.'' **********General Yershov said that the party's censure had been removed from his record recently but that he had long since stopped caring. He also said he was not concerned about any trouble that might face him for speaking out in Washington. **********As he spoke, Mr. Lozansky laughed admiringly. ''For a time, his fellow generals were afraid to be associated with him,'' he said. ''Now, they envy him, because he is a free man who can say what he wants and go where he wants, luxuries that are practically impossible for a Russian general.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/08/business/us-taiwan-negotiations-stalled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-Taiwan Negotiations Stalled", "print_headline": "U.S.-Taiwan Negotiations Stalled", "body_text": " **********Officials of the United States and Taiwan failed to reach agreement today on trade differences after five days of talks in which the Americans urged the Taiwanese to liberalize import practices even further. **********At the final session with the United States delegation, headed by the deputy assistant United States trade representative, Mark Orr, Taiwan gave details of its plan to cut its trade surplus.

''They can have an end-of-year sale, but that would steal sales from the future and make the market even more dependent on incentives.

Offering Big Discounts **********So far, manufacturers have made only small production cuts. Instead, they have offered some of the biggest discounts ever in an attempt to clear inventories.

A similar fall-off occurred last year, and for the same reason. Consumers rushed their purchases in late May to take advantage of expiring incentives, which left a vacuum in early June even though the companies renewed most of their incentives. **********''You used to get a huge spike in sales when incentives came on, with annual selling rates as high as 16 million in a single 10-day period,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. ''Now, with about $700 of discounts per car since April, they've been selling at an average of about 7.2 million. That compares with the 7.5 million cars actually sold in 1988.''

Light trucks gained 3.8 percent, to a record for the period of 46,789 units. This was nearly offset by a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in car sales, to 100,017 units. **********Ford's light-vehicle sales rose 1.6 percent, to 98,649. Car sales increased 5.2 percent, to 61,507, and light trucks declined 3.9 percent, to 37,142. **********Chrysler alone had a net decline in sales, of 1.2 percent. Its car sales fell 6.7 percent, to 25,924, but its light-truck sales gained 4.6 percent, to 27,624. Japanese Makers Gain 17.4% **********The Japanese-owned domestic manufacturers sold 15,939 vehicles, up 17.4 percent. Honda of America sold 7,788 cars, up 16.2 percent. Toyota Motor Manufacturing sold 3,202 cars, a threefold increase. Mazda Motor Manufacturing sold 667 cars, up 9.9 percent. **********Mitsubishi Motor Sales, which had not entered the domestic market in the corresponding period last year, sold 835 Eclipse cars. **********The Nissan Motor Company sold 1,308 American-made cars, down 45.9 percent, and 2,139 light trucks, down 23.9 percent.

''The company has often made promises in the past, and just as often it has missed in its ability to reach its target,'' said Jeffrey Ashenberg of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********Avon's letter to its shareholders, from James E. Preston, the company's chairman and chief executive, predicted that 1989 earnings from continuing operations would range from $2.30 to $2.40 a share.

At the moment, his choice would probably be a cap marked ''bold.'' **********As president and chief executive of Mexico's biggest maker of glass products, Mr. Martens - along with the company's chairman, Adrian Sada - has just presided over the first successful hostile takeover of an American concern by a Mexican company. **********In a deal that was begun Aug. 9 and is expected to be formalized soon, Vitro is acquiring the Anchor Glass Container Corporation, the second-largest glass container manufacturer in the United States. The cost of Vitro's American foray is estimated at more than $900 million, including $460 million in Anchor debt, the purchase of the Latchford Glass Company of Huntington Park, Calif., for $48 million and the installation of Latchford's management at Anchor. 'We Had to Expand' **********''We had to expand our base,'' Mr. Martens said when asked why Vitro had decided to make acquisitions in the United States. Mr. Martens, a 56-year-old chemical engineer, was chief executive at Union Carbide de Mexico before he joined Vitro in 1977. **********''If we want to continue to be a glass company, as we have been for 80 years, we can no longer be satisfied having a strong domestic base and some export activity,'' he continued. ''With a more open Mexican economy, our strategy has had to change.'' **********The watershed transaction comes at a time when the United States and Mexico are making big efforts to scale down barriers that have slowed the growth of trade between them. During a state visit to Washington by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari earlier this month, officials of the two countries signed an agreement that promises to reduce tariffs and open investment opportunities in important industrial sectors like automobiles, steel, telecommunications, petrochemicals, computers, textiles and processed foods. **********Analysts here and in Mexico City said they would not be surprised to see other Mexican companies, faced with the prospect of increased competition here, move into the American market through the takeover route. Shopping for Banks **********Cementos Mexicanos recently bought several concrete plants in the Southwest, for example, and some of Mexico's state-owned banks are known to be shopping for savings and loan associations and small banks in Texas and California. **********But the biggest impact of Vitro's acquisition of Anchor is likely to be felt among Monterrey's other industrial giants, like the Alfa, Visa and Cydsa conglomerates, whose activities include steel, paper cartons, plastics, beer and chemicals. Until the death of Eugenio Garza Sada in 1973, all four companies were run as divisions of the Monterrey Group, and even today they remain closely linked by blood ties and a common outlook. **********''These guys are all first cousins, so you can be sure they are talking to each other,'' another American analyst here said. ''All of them also happen to be cash-flush, with money coming out of their ears, so now that the first step has been taken by Vitro, the odds are that we will see it happen again.'' **********That Vitro, which last year recorded income of $152 million on revenues of $1.1 billion at recent exchange rates, turned out to be the first Mexican company to move north across the border by the takeover route has surprised few here. Entrepreneurial Spirit **********The business community in this industrial center of three million people less than 100 miles south of the Rio Grande is renowned throughout Mexico for its entrepreneurial spirit, and Vitro, which was founded in 1909 to make glass bottles for beer, is regarded as one of the best-run businesses in Monterrey. **********''In Vitro we have observed a management that has been very aggressive, in the sense of diversification and expansion, and capable of achieving growth in spite of the economic crisis from which the country has been suffering since 1982,'' said Jorge Placido Evangelista, an analyst at Operadora de Bolsa, a large brokerage house in Mexico City. ''It's also in the vanguard of technology, much of which it has developed itself and has been exporting.'' **********Nevertheless, Vitro's acquisition of Anchor comes after a decade of great change and retrenchment for the publicly held conglomerate, dominated since its earliest days by members of the Sada and Garza families. Like many Mexican companies, Vitro borrowed heavily during the oil boom of the late 1970's, to find itself reeling from twin blows in 1982, when oil prices collapsed and the Mexican Government nationalized a bank owned by the company. Astute Negotiators **********By 1983, Vitro's debt to foreign banks had risen to $758 million. But the company was never forced to declare a loss, and it showed unusual skill and astuteness in talks with its bank creditors, with the result that indebtedness had been reduced to $15 million in August. **********''Vitro showed a capacity to negotiate with the banks,'' Mr. Placido said. ''They took firm positions and held to them.'' **********In the mid-1980's, additional pressure came from the Government's decision to open up Mexico's closed domestic market to foreign imports and competition, which was followed by Mexico's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986. **********''If we had done nothing, we would have ended up with a strong domestic market position, but with everybody outside shooting at us,'' Mr. Martens said. **********Faced with recession at home, Vitro also embarked on an effort to raise its profile in overseas markets. Exports, which totaled $108 million in 1984, had grown to more than $250 million by 1988, including items ranging from delicate crystalware sold at Neiman-Marcus and soft-drink bottles made for Coca-Cola and Pepsico to sophisticated glass-making machinery for American clients and windshields and windows for Ford automobiles. Appeal to the Middle Class **********In Mexico, Vitro has also diversified into product lines that appeal to middle-class Mexican consumers who hope the worst of the economic crisis has passed. In one of its 12 joint ventures, the company makes Samsonite luggage, mostly for the domestic market, while a joint venture with Whirlpool, to make refrigerators and stoves, was begun in 1985. **********Mr. Martens said Vitro planned to use its advanced glass-making technology to help restore the competitive position of Anchor, which has recorded net losses of nearly $26 million over the last four quarters. That strong technological position, market analysts said, should help Vitro recover a large chunk of the $400 million the company has said it plans to invest in Anchor over the next five years. **********''This is the most brilliant move that any company in Monterrey has made,'' an American economist here said. ''Vitro has opened a huge window into the United States, and I would suspect we are going to see them benefit from a lot of cross-fertilization and cross-trafficking.'' In American Hands **********Mr. Martens said Vitro planned to shut three of Anchor's existing United States plants and would name Federico Sada, the 40-year-old head of Vitro's container division, as Anchor's vice-chairman. But Vitro executives said day-to-day management would remain in American hands. **********''Anchor is to be an independent subsidiary, not a part of the Vitro container division,'' said Mr. Sada, who studied at Washington University in St. Louis and at Harvard. ''My role will be indirect, at the board level.'' **********While some Wall Street analysts viewed the $21.25-a-share price paid by Vitro for Anchor as overly generous, Vitro's senior management said the purchase was worth the price, especially in view of the company's desire to gain a foothold in the United States and become a worldwide force in the glass industry. ''We're buying 26 percent of the biggest market in the world,'' Mr. Martens said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/business/business-technology-new-chips-offer-the-promise-of-much-speedier-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1989-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Chips Offer the Promise Of Much Speedier Computers", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; New Chips Offer the Promise Of Much Speedier Computers", "body_text": " **********Scientists have begun to combine two or more substances to create devices on computer chips that switch electronic signals hundreds of times faster than existing models. **********Widespread use of such chips is several years away, and their development is unlikely to mean the end of silicon, the mainstay of the electronics industry. But the incredibly fast speeds that the new chips promise mean that computers and other electronics will become vastly faster and smaller. **********Several experimental versions of the devices, known as heterojunctions, have been built. They have set speed records, as well as pointing the way to revolutionary designs for electronic devices of the future. 'Records Were Blown Away' **********''All the speed records were blown away by heterojunctions this year,'' said James C. Sturm, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Princeton University. **********At the International Electron Devices Meeting in San Francisco last month, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and Hughes Research Laboratories each reported speed records using heterojunctions. Nippon's transistor switched on and off in 2-trillionths of a second, or 2 picoseconds, compared with several hundred picoseconds for conventional silicon transistors. **********As a sign of how small electronic devices might become, scientists at the Bell Laboratories last year created a single experimental transistor, known as a resonant tunneling transistor, that could do the work of 24 conventional transistors. **********Such approaches, if brought to commercial fruition, are expected to have a significant impact on a wide variety of electronics applications. Applications could come in much faster and vastly smaller supercomputers, very high speed optical fiber communications systems and faster and more precise weapons systems. A Shrinking Technology **********Microelectronic circuits are known as chips because they are made with chips of silicon. In general, chips are composed of transistors, which function as little switches. Electrical current goes from one end of the device to the other, crossing through a gate that sometimes lets the current pass and sometimes does not, providing the on-off signals used by computers. **********The main way of making transistors faster has been to make them smaller, so the current travels a shorter distance. The shrinking allowed computers to become smaller and cheaper as well. **********But engineers say that in a few years it will not be possible to gain speed merely by shrinking silicon circuits. After that, any improvements would have to come from new materials. Already gallium arsenide, a faster material than silicon, is being used where speed is crucial, like optical-fiber communications, critical. But to go even beyond gallium arsenide, scientists envision using combinations of materials, usually gallium arsenide and related compounds like aluminum gallium arsenide and indium phosphide. **********What makes this possible is a technology called molecular beam epitaxy. The technology allows one material to be laid on top of another in very thin sheets, atomic layer by atomic layer, in a form of high-tech spray painting. **********''You can grow anything on anything, to a good approximation,'' said Federico Capasso, head of a device research department at Bell Laboratories, a pioneer in molecular beam epitaxy. ''You have almost infinite freedom of design.'' **********Materials differ in a fundamental property, known as the bandgap. It can be thought of as the minimum energy level of the electrons - the current - flowing through the material. If one likens electrons to marbles rolling on the floor, then the bandgap can be thought of as the height of the floor. **********Marbles can easily roll from a high floor to a lower floor, but they cannot go back up to the high floor without an energy boost. A marble might require someone to pick it up. With electrons, the energy would come from increasing the voltage. **********By building such split-level houses for electrons - a process known as bandgap engineering - designers can funnel electrons in certain directions and block them from moving in others. ''You can engineer the fundamental properties of the semiconductor,'' Dr. Capasso said. **********The simplest way to use this technique is to set aside one floor of the house for the marbles. Anything that might interfere with their movement, like furniture, would be kept on different floors. **********In a semiconductor, interference comes not from furniture but from certain foreign atoms. To form a current in semiconductors, engineers introduce foreign atoms that carry more electrons than the atoms of the semiconductor material. These extra electrons can break free and travel though the material. **********But once an electron breaks away from its atom, the atom becomes positively charged and exerts an attractive force on other electrons passing by. Such attraction slows the movement of the electrons. **********In a split-level house, this need not be a problem. One level, made of gallium arsenide, has a low floor, and the other, made of aluminum gallium arsenide, has a high floor. The foreign atoms can be introduced only into the material with the high floor. The electrons will roll down to the lower floor and remain there. They will be able to move around without being slowed by attractions from the foreign atoms, which remain on the upper floor. **********This is the idea behind the high electron mobility transistor, or HEMT. Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan has been most aggressive in pursuing this technology, and such HEMT's are already in use in Japan as highly sensitive receivers for signals sent from satellites. **********Even more novel and potentially faster devices can be made by making the layers of different materials so thin that the laws of quantum mechanics come into play, with some curious results. To do this, layers would have to be about 10-billionths of a meter thick, 1 one-hundredth the size of today's circuit elements. **********Such a thin room with a high floor resembles a wall more than a room. Normally, the marbles trying to get past the wall would need enough energy to go over it. Marbles hitting the wall at lower levels would simply bounce back. **********But quantum mechanics holds that if the wall is thin enough, the marbles will occasionally pass right through the wall, a process known as tunneling. How this can occur relates to the fact that electrons are not really marbles at all. While they act like marbles sometimes, they also exhibit properties of waves, like light waves. **********If the tunneling could be turned on and off, a very fast transistor is possible, perhaps capable of switching on or off in fractions of a picosecond. At the electron devices meeting last month, Texas Instruments Inc. introduced such a device, known as a resonant tunneling transistor. **********Texas Instruments used a layer of gallium arsenide sandwiched between layers of aluminum gallium arsenide. In effect, this creates two walls very close together. The area between them forms a quantum well. **********The electrons - think of them as waves now instead of marbles - can exist inside the well only at certain wavelengths, corresponding to a certain energy level. This is similar to the principle that an organ pipe makes a sound of a distinctive pitch, known as its resonant frequencies. Only electrons at one of these well-defined resonant energy levels can pass through the well and both walls. **********Such transistors offer intriguing possibilities because electrons can pass through the well at one of several energy levels. Instead of merely representing a one or a zero, as is the case with current transistors, such a device can represent one of several states.

Several analysts predict that total shipments in the second half of the year will be down as much as 15 percent from the comparable period of 1988. **********As a result, total steel industry earnings, which have increased steadily over the last three years, will begin to fall this year, analysts say. They also predict intensifying competition among steel producers and possibly some price cutting. Drop in Shipments Expected **********Several analysts estimate that industry shipments, which were about 84 million tons last year, will fall to about 81 million tons this year and to 75 million tons in 1990. The predictions take into account a drop in business from automobile makers, as well as makers of appliances, machinery and construction materials. **********''Things won't get much better in the coming months, either,'' said John Jacobson, an economist with the AUS Group in Philadelphia. ''Profits and shipments are likely to be at their their lowest point in the last few years.'' **********Already, steel prices have fallen to their lowest point in more than two years, and operating rates for the nation's steel mills have tumbled to an average of 80 percent in the third quarter, from nearly 90 percent a year earlier. **********Still, analysts say the effect on steel companies, which will report earnings later this month, will be less severe than in previous periods of declining shipments. For one thing, they say, steel companies are leaner and have lowered their break-even levels. **********''Steel companies should still be profitable next year,'' said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''With the improvements that have come in efficiency over the last few years, operating profits should still be fairly good.'' **********Mr. Plummer further explained that the decline in steel shipments and orders was ''a natural part of the industry's cycle,'' adding that ''after a 24-month boom period, you can expect market conditions to alter somewhat.'' **********Steel industry executives said the decline in shipments was generally in line with their expectations of market conditions this year. Many said they had altered their production and employment levels in anticipation of those conditions. **********''We've been in a cost-cutting mode for a number of years,'' said Gary Millenbruch, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's third-largest steel producer. ''We have already been under the strategy of divesting our underperforming assets and modernizing our facilities.'' **********Steel shipments were down to about 19 million tons in the third quarter from 20.3 million tons in the quarter last year, Mr. Plummer said. That compares with an average of 22 million tons in the preceding two quarters, which were down slightly from the 1988 period. **********Some steel industry executives discount the premise that price competition will result from the downturn in industry shipments and prices. They contend that they learned their lesson after the wrenching industrywide recession of the early 1980's, which left steel companies discounting prices in a desperate attempt to cling to market share. **********''No one wants a return to those days,'' said a marketing executive at a large steel company who asked to remain anonymous. ''I think that the major steel companies have seen what can happen when you begin to have intensified price competition. No one wants that to happen again.'' As evidence of the industry's resolve to avoid such a scenario, executives point to the period after the six-month labor dispute at the USX Corporation that began in the summer of 1986. When the shutdown ended, steel prices, defying analysts' predictions, remained firm. **********Nonetheless some operators of steel service centers - the industry intermediaries who cut and shape steel to customers' specifications -say that they have begun to see evidence of price competition. **********While most steel companies will report their earnings within the next two weeks, Inland Steel Industries, which operates the nation's fourth-largest steel company, last week said that its third-quarter earnings plunged 70 percent from the year-earlier period. **********''The short-term business outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets,'' said Inland's chairman, Frank Luerssen. ''The modest downturn of economic growth that began in the third quarter is reflected in some continued softness in our steel and service center markets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/13/world/silence-and-glee-eastern-bloc-reacts-to-poland.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1989-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Silence and Glee: Eastern Bloc Reacts to Poland", "print_headline": "Silence and Glee: Eastern Bloc Reacts to Poland", "body_text": " **********From total official silence in Rumania to excited accounts in Hungary, the reactions across Eastern Europe to the milestone agreement in Poland last week reflected the differing degrees of enthusiasm in each country for newly proferred freedoms. **********The Polish pact marked the biggest step any Eastern European country had taken toward democracy since Mikhail S.

'Certainly Not Socialism' **********Though the official Communist organs refrained from any direct comment, a major article criticizing experimentation appeared in East Germany's most widely read newspaper, the Communist youth daily Junge Welt, on the same day the Warsaw accords were announced. **********The article declared that unemployment and the emergence of bourgeois parties and independent unions in fraternal countries ''is certainly not socialism and it will certainly not develop from this.'' **********The Czechoslovak handling of the Polish developments was marked by extensive detail, and though major papers carried little commentary, what did appear was not critical. **********Experts on Eastern European affairs said the extent of the coverage in itself was a noteworthy development for Czechoslovakia, since only recently phrases like ''political pluralism'' would have been described as ''reactionary'' or ''destabilizing.'' Full Coverage of Talks **********Now, the Government press and television quoted extensively from Mr. Walesa's comments, including phrases held as heresy by orthodox Communists, like ''the opposition demands abolition of the leading role of the party.'' **********The Communist party daily Rude Pravo gave full coverage of the talks and agreements, avoiding comment. **********The youth paper, Mlada Fronta, was more forward, saying the purpose of the Polish talks was to bring the ''constructive opposition'' out of its negative stance and link it with the process of the country's renewal. **********The Bulgarian press, by contrast, gave Polish events relatively cursory treatment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/business/credit-markets-rates-advance-as-dollar-plunges.html": {"writer_name": "H.

The amount involved was said to be $800 million to $1 billion of notes and bonds. **********The sharp declines in Treasury securities prices and the dollar also caused heavy selling in the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 28.36 points, to 2,475, after a late recovery. **********Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply declined in May. It was the first such contraction since April 1980 and was interpreted by some economists as either heralding an economic decline or as an aberration caused by larger-than-expected Federal tax collections. Long-Term Bond Down $15 **********In late dealings in the market, the benchmark long-term Treasury bonds were offered at 106 11/32, down 1 18/32, equivalent to more than $15 for each $1,000 of face value. The bond's yield climbed to 8.29 percent from 8.17 percent Wednesday. **********Among other representative Treasury maturities traded in the secondary market, the 9 1/8's of 1999 dropped 29/32, at 105 10/32, with the yield rising to 8.32 percent from 8.20 percent; the 8 5/8's of 1994 lost 16/32, or a half-point, as the yield increased to 8.34 percent from 8.22 percent, and the 8 3/4's of 1991 fell 7/32, to 100 17/32, with the yield rising to 8.44 percent from 8.32 percent. **********''The reaction to the reports that the Fed was asking for bids on behalf of the Bank of Japan was immediate and sharp,'' one Treasury securities dealer said. Since the latest surge in the dollar began a month ago, the Fed has sold roughly $3.5 billion of the Treasury securities it holds for foreign customers, and many of the dollars raised by such sales have been sold on the currency markets to dampen the rise in the dollar. Fed Drains Reserves **********Indeed, the Federal Reserve resumed its draining of reserves, much of which resulted from currency market interventions, by effecting four-day matched sales of Treasury securities to dealers. **********The Fed's draining operation came as the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, was trading at 9 3/8 percent. The funds traded at that level for the rest of the session and tended to depress prices of the longer-term Treasury bills. The discount rate on 90-day bills fell 4 basis points, to 8.09 percent, but the six-month bills jumped 11 basis points, to 7.89 percent, and the one-year bills gained 7 basis points, to 7.88 percent. **********''Once news of the Fed's bids for Treasury coupon issues hit the Street, the dollar began diving, and this in turn caused many domestic portfolio managers to start unloading,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president and money market expert at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The sellers were saying, in effect, that if the Japanese are selling Treasury paper, why shouldn't we? The big question now is whether the sales by the Bank of Japan were technical in nature or represent a change in its policy.'' **********As for the day's flow of economic statistics from Washington, Mr. Sullivan said the trade deficit figures were overshadowed by the Fed's actions. **********Somewhat more negative for the bond market was the industrial production data. With May factory utilization above many estimates, the gross national product in the second quarter is expected to be well above many economic forecasts as well. **********Late in the day, the Fed reported that the M-1 money supply, measuring cash in circulation and checking accounts, fell $9.7 billion in May. M-2, which includes M-1, savings accounts and some time deposits, dropped by $8.3 billion, and M-3, the broadest measure of the money supply, fell by $2.9 billion. The Reuters news service also reported that the Federal Reserve said the drop in M-1 and M-2 was the largest monthly decline since April 1980, when M-1 fell $8.2 billion and M-2 fell $6.4 billion. **********The weekly money-supply numbers, which are deemed less significant, were all up: M-1 by $2.3 billion, M-2 by $4 billion and M-3 by $6.8 billion. **********''The monthly money supply figures can be interpreted as indicating a tight credit situation; it can mean consumer and business demand for credit is weak,'' Mr. Sullivan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/world/a-sandinista-promise-gone-sour-alienates-nicaragua-s-working-class.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1989-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1812, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Sandinista Promise Gone Sour Alienates Nicaragua's Working Class", "print_headline": "A Sandinista Promise Gone Sour Alienates Nicaragua's Working Class", "body_text": " **********On a crumbling wall here, some aging graffiti sum up the Sandinista National Liberation Front's pledge to the urban poor: ''Workers! The F.S.L.N. will never let you down!'' **********In broad red brushstrokes, the slogan defines the revolutionary compact that once bound the Sandinistas to Nicaragua's working class, helping the insurgent movement to seize power in 1979. **********But after three years of political and economic crisis, the promise has faded along with the paint. **********Battered by galloping inflation, Nicaraguan workers have seen their real wages fall by more than 90 percent since 1981, forcing huge cuts in private consumption. Large-scale layoffs of Government workers and a deep industrial decline have left thousands of people in Managua and other cities without jobs. And with national elections less than three and a half months away, the urban workers who once sustained the Sandinista Government have now become one of its most serious potential liabilities. Prices Rise as Salaries Lag **********''For us, the economy has been destroyed, just destroyed,'' said Alcides Flores, a 42-year-old worker in Managua. ''Every day the prices go up, but our salaries stay the same. People are doing anything they can just to survive, and they blame the Government for what is happening to us.'' **********In the last week, the issue of economic hardship has been overshadowed here by the Government's decision to end its cease-fire with contra rebels and by fears that new fighting may interfere with national elections scheduled for Feb. 25. **********But workers in Managua, which has been relatively untouched by direct effects of the war against the contras, dread the threat of renewed fighting also for its economic cost. Some opposition leaders have accused the Government of raising the specter of war precisely to distract people from the hardships of daily life. **********Over the last two years, the Sandinista Government has taken tough measures to halt the economy's rapid deterioration, which Government officials ascribe to the heavy burden of the eight-year war against American-backed rebels. Those measures, mainly deep cuts in Government spending and investment, have succeeded in reducing inflation, which reached an annual rate of 36,000 percent last year, to less than 10 percent a month. 'Life Is Horrible' **********But the fight to regain control of the currency has left the economy in a deep recession, particularly in the industrial sector, which is expected to shrink by roughly 20 percent this year alone, according to confidential Government figures. The consequences of that contraction are being borne largely in urban areas, which account for more than 80 percent of the country's industry. And with nothing to fall back on but their shrinking salaries, urban workers - who make up an estimated 25 percent of the nation's voters - have felt the full force of Nicaragua's economic crisis. **********''Life is horrible right now,'' said Luis, a 30-year-old driver who asked not to be further identified. ''We have been left out, put on the margins, and the situation just keeps getting worse. I think the problems are irreversible.'' **********In dozens of interviews throughout Managua and surrounding areas, low-income workers from the public and private sectors alike expressed despair about their economic circumstances and many said that economic reasons alone would compel them to vote for the opposition. Although most of those interviewed said they believed the war had been important in starting the economic slide, few said it could justify their continuing hardship. And many said flatly that they did not believe the Government was able or willing to solve the nation's economic crisis. **********''We used to eat three times a day, like normal people,'' said Luis Edmundo Sanchez, a salaried laborer in Managua. ''But I can only afford to eat twice, and it is the same with everybody I know. The only ones who can afford to eat are in the Government.'' Favored Treatment for City **********Such criticism is a dramatic change from the early days of the Sandinista regime, when the Government, acting to fulfill its revolutionary ideals, used subsidies and price controls to give city dwellers more favorable terms of trade than their counterparts in the countryside, bringing a surge of prosperity to Nicaragua's fledgling proletariat. **********Those policies, together with the start of the contra war, helped produce a nationwide exodus from the countryside to the cities, giving Managua one of the highest urban growth rates in the world. According to official estimates, the capital now holds more than one million people, or one-third of all Nicaraguans, gravely straining housing, water and sewerage services, which are barely suitable for half that population. All of the city's services were badly damaged in the devastating earthquake of 1972 and were never substantially repaired. **********To halt the influx to the cities and to reduce discontent that gave contra forces rural support, the Government changed its economic policies in 1984 in favor of rural producers. A gradual increase in the relative prices paid for farm products, together with a new emphasis on redistribution of land into individual farms instead of large cooperatives, helped to reduce rural support for the contras. **********But the new policies did not halt the migration into the cities. And they only compounded the problems of the thousands of Nicaraguans who had already abandoned the countryside for the city. Many Eat Just One Meal a Day **********Economists who have studied the resulting economic collision say it combined a glut of workers with a battered urban economy. And it was compounded by an American embargo on trade with Nicaragua, poor Government management and uncontrolled inflation caused by high military expenditures. **********The most important problem, the economists say, is not the supply of adequate food and other products at city markets, but the low buying power of the workers who consume those goods. **********At current exchange rates, for example, a typical Government-paid laborer earns about 500,000 cordobas, or roughly $20, for a month's work. That salary must be stretched to meet rising prices, which have left a single one-pound can of powdered milk, enough to feed one child for three to four days, costing more than 80,000 cordobas, a pound of pork at 24,000 cordobas, and a pair of shoes at 600,000 to 800,000 cordobas. **********''By the time we get paid, the money has already been spent just to pay for food,'' said Alberto Ruiz, a 32-year-old government construction foreman. He said most families had given up eating meat, and many had been reduced to one meal a day. **********Experts say the collapse of real wages masks an increasing reliance on barter, payments in kind, gifts from relatives abroad and unrecorded transactions on the black market - the so-called informal economy. **********''There is not a formal social safety net,'' said Mario Arana Sevilla, an economist at a Government-sponsored research institute in Managua. ''But there are informal ways, informal strategies that people have worked out in order to get by.'' Consumption Down Sharply **********But official figures show that per capita private consumption has fallen by at least 70 percent under Sandinista rule. In an election season that figure alone has placed the Government on the defensive. And while many diplomats and economists believe that the Government recovery plan is well designed, they note that it demands harsh sacrifices now for stability later - a trade-off that could hardly be more damaging to the Sandinistas' election efforts. **********Economists say the Government is likely to benefit politically from the large numnber of workers who are paid directly by the state and who may vote in favor of Sandinista leaders to protect their jobs. Approximately 58 percent of urban workers and about 71 percent of skilled technicians are employed by the state, according to a recent study. **********The economic recovery measures also provide near-term benefits for some groups, notably small entrepreneurs, who are now viewed as vital to an economic revival. But many diplomats note that the entrepreneurs and market vendors were among the first, and the bitterest, enemies of the Sandinistas. And they doubt that the Government will win many new votes among such dedicated opponents. **********Instead, the diplomats say, the Government's greatest efforts at this point are likely to be directed not at winning back disenchanted urban workers, but at avoiding new economic shocks that would alienate still more. In a country where exchange rates are watched as avidly as sports scores, rumors abound that the Government is preparing a new devaluation that would perhaps halve the value of the cordoba against the dollar. And critics of the Government argue that the cost of the election itself may touch off a round of economic shocks that could be catastrophic for Sandinista prestige. **********''The Government will have to spend at least $25 million on election costs, and it is also reaching the part of the production cycle where it must pay producers for goods that have been exported,'' said Mario Alegria Castillo, a private economist. ''If it doesn't get some form of outside help, it will have to cover that cost by printing money, but that would mean new inflation. It is like a baseball runner who has been caught between the bases.'' 'Everything Will Be Better!' **********In a tacit acknowledgement of their weak economic record, Sandinista leaders have adopted a forward-looking campaign slogan: ''Everything will be better!'' **********The slogan, Sandinista officials say, refers to the influx of new aid, particularly from Western Europe, and to improved commercial relationships that they believe will follow if the election process is judged to be free and fair, certifying Nicaragua's democratic credentials. Part of such a new environment, they say, would be the ending of the United States trade embargo and the withdrawal of American opposition to multilateral lending to the Sandinista Government. **********But such optimism is viewed coldly by many Managua workers who assert that Sandinista leaders have already forfeited the allegiance of the urban working class. Several said that if relations with the United States were the answer to the economic crisis the opposition was better suited for the job. Well-publicized foreign donations to the opposition parties here have been interpreted by many Nicaraguans as proof that the opposition, not the Sandinistas, has better access to the foreign money necessary to relieve Nicaragua's crisis. **********''Everything will be better, but only because they will be gone,'' said a Managua heavy-equipment operator, referring to the Sandinistas. ''The worker won't give him his vote.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/21/world/reporter-s-notebook-at-persepolis-shadows-of-two-pasts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; At Persepolis, Shadows of Two Pasts", "print_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; At Persepolis, Shadows of Two Pasts", "body_text": " **********There is no sound-and-light show in Persepolis anymore.

He dressed his soldiers in uniforms of thousands of years ago. **********What did it all cost? ''His throne, I guess,'' answered Ameen Zadeh, an engineer who lives in Shiraz. ''The Shah claimed he sat on the Peacock Throne. He had peacock brains, too.'' A Magician and the Imam **********At the Homa Hotel in Shiraz, a magician waited to pay his bill by the cashier's desk. A birdcage, in which he kept two pigeons he uses in his act, sat beside him on the floor. ''It's been a busy time,'' he told an inquisitive foreigner, adding that the whole week is booked with engagements. **********Is he really that good? He pulled a coin from his pocket, giving a mischievous smile as he made it disappear between his fingers. Couldn't he have done the same thing, the foreigner teased, with the invading Iraqi armies that came into Iran to cause so much havoc in eight years of war? **********The magician laughed loudly. ''I am just a magician, not a miracle maker,'' he said. ''For this you need the Imam.'' Imam is the title Iranians use to refer to their 88-year-old leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. **********On the evening of Feb. 8, the Imam looked tired and older. **********It was the first time he had appeared on national television in months. He had just announced an amnesty for thousands of political prisoners. He sat on a balcony staring impassively at a crowd of air force officers below who came to salute him. Someone else read his message. When he stood up, he moved about slowly, waving feebly to the crowd. **********In 12 days of traveling around Iran and in interviews with ordinary Iranians, a reporter found little doubt that the Ayatollah remains the most charismatic and revered leader in modern Iranian history. As one businessman in the bazaar put it, ''If the Imam asks for a million people to demonstrate, he will get three million.'' Yet recent decisions, or indecisions, have raised questions and whispers. **********A few weeks ago, angered over remarks made in a television interview about the Prophet Mohammed's daughter - when a woman said she would rather find a role model among more contemporary women - he ordered all those responsible for the program arrested and executed. The incident became the talk of Iran. A few days later, the Ayatollah granted a pardon, when he was told that it was all an innocent mistake. **********In another incident, an employee in the office of the Ayatollah, Mohammad Ansari, brought him a pleading letter, eventually publicized, asking why the leader was allowing conflict to thrive and confusion to prevail among his followers. The Ayatollah responded that Mr. Ansari was being ''too emotional.'' **********He then went on to say that all matters of importance must be discusssed thoroughly because that is the essence of Islamic values. The long process, the Ayatollah said, leads to ''mature decision.'' U.S. 'Experts' Remembered **********On Lavan Island in the Persian Gulf, Mohammed Shakerian remembers the morning of Feb. 10, 1988, vividly. **********Mr. Shakerian, a manager of oil production on this island from which Iran controls several offshore platforms, got a call from a radio operator near the Salman oil rig, about 90 miles out at sea, just before 9 A.M., telling him that five American gunships were surrounding the platform and had told everyone to jump in the water because they were about to blow it up. **********Only one worker jumped into the sea. The other 35 Iranian workers on the platform scrambled into a tug boat and watched the United States Navy commandos land on the platform, plant explosives and reduce $400 million worth of equipment, steel platforms, generators and pipelines to smoke and fire. The United States was taking revenge for Iran's planting of mines in the gulf. **********A few days ago, an American-made Bell helicopter landed a few reporters on the platform. A sign riddled with holes, saying ''Happiness Is Safety,'' was about the only thing on the steel structure still intact. **********''They started shooting almost immediately after the five-minute warning and would not let anyone come close to the platform for 17 hours afterward,'' Mr. Shakerian said as he tiptoed around large holes on the floor. **********''They were experts,'' he said.

''I think you are making a big, big mistake if you have everything invested in fixed income.'' **********If inflation remains a moderate 4.5 percent, it would take $1,553 to buy goods in 10 years that cost $1,000 today; in 20 years, it would take $2,412. At the inflation rate of the last decade, 6.46 percent, it would take $1,870 in 10 years and $3,497 in 20 years. **********Many people prefer to avoid risks, choosing ''safe'' investments that will let them sleep at night, Mr. Morlitz said, but they are focusing on market risk while overlooking business risk (affecting a particular holding where one has a big stake such as the A. H. Robins-Dalkon Shield case), interest rate risk and purchasing power risk. **********Diversification is a key to managing these risks, he said. That means diversifying assets and changing one's investment styles over time. Many executives have accumulated blocks of their employer's stock but have been so immersed in their work that they have not taken time to redirect their assets into a diversified portfolio. **********Even geography is part of diversification. ''If you own a block of I.B.M. stock, don't buy a rental property in Westchester County,'' Mr. Morlitz said. ''If I.B.M. moves south, think what will happen to Westchester real estate.'' **********A retired person might have time to manage a rental property, however, and therefore might wish to buy one elsewhere, or might want to diversify the stockholdings and buy the rental property close to home. **********Mr. Morlitz advised people nearing retirement to pay off their debts because in retirement they may not have enough cash flow to cover those debts. The exceptions to the debt-free rule, he said, are home mortgages and debt incurred to buy an income-producing asset like a rental property. **********When it comes to securities portfolios, ''we're proponents of professional management,'' he said, because it takes ability, as well as time and willingness to do well in the market. ''How are you going to go out and compete with people who are immersed in the market day to day and make their living by it?'' he asked. ''It's a pipe dream.'' **********For portfolios of $500,000 or $1 million or more, Mr. Morlitz recommended that investors select a well-regarded firm that manages individual accounts, like Neuberger Berman, Lazard Freres, Sanford Bernstein or Morgan Guaranty. For smaller accounts he recommended no-load or low-load mutual funds, like those in the Fidelity and Vanguard groups. Arthur Andersen, an accounting and consulting firm, does not manage investments. **********One favorite investment for retirement is a tax-deferred annuity sold by insurance companies, and here Mr. Morlitz advised that the company be carefully chosen. Some insurance companies have invested heavily in ''junk bonds'' and could suffer large losses, affecting their ability to pay out on annuities. Others, like Northwestern Mutual, Massachusetts Mutual and New England Mutual Life, have lower-risk portfolios, he added.  Help in Retirement Planning **********T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., the Baltimore-based investment management firm, is offering a free retirement planning kit to help people figure out how much money they will need for retirement and how to reach their goals. The kit can be ordered by calling 1-800-638-5660. **********The kit has a 16-page, letter-sized workbook developed with Coopers & Lybrand that explains how to calculate income and expected retirement needs, allowing for various rates of return on investment and inflation. It guides people through the process step by step. Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of Price, estimates that it will take people who have well-organized records an hour to work through the booklet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/world/soviets-report-1000-dead-in-quake-induced-slide.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1989-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Report 1,000 Dead in Quake-Induced Slide", "print_headline": "Soviets Report 1,000 Dead in Quake-Induced Slide", "body_text": " **********An earthquake struck mountainous Soviet Central Asia at dawn today, setting off an enormous landslide that killed about 1,000 farm villagers, the Government press agency Tass said. **********Tass said the earthquake in the Republic of Tadzhikistan was less powerful than the one that killed 25,000 people in Armenia, 1,300 miles to the west, on Dec. 7. The epicenter was in a heavily populated agricultural district 18 to 30 miles southwest of Dushanbe, the Tadzhik capital, Tass said. **********The tremor set off a mass of saturated clay and sandstone that flowed down the slopes of the steep earthen hills in the Gissar district and buried three rural settlements, according to reports by Tass and the central Government newspaper, Izvestia. Scenes of Destruction **********The village of Sharora, site of an agricultural research institute, was the worst hit, according to the Soviet reports. The landslide buried the village under 45 feet of mud, killing hundreds of people, the reports said. **********The earthquake is certain to place new demands on the Soviet budget when the economy is shaky and still reeling from the Armenia temblor. Tass said the cost of the Tadzhikistan quake was still being assessed, but the tremor wiped out roads and many highway bridges, destroyed power and communications lines, killed thousands of head of cattle and covered a wide swath of fertile farmland with a thick layer of sand and clay. **********On the evening news program tonight, Soviet television broadcast scenes of the stricken area that showed one- and two-story houses that were destroyed, and broad flows of mud and debris from the landslides. The preliminary death toll was put at 1,000, Tass said, and the television report said 104 people had been taken to hospitals. Rescue teams were unable to reach some remote settlements today, Tass said. **********The flow of mud and clay from the mountains, soaked by winter snows and frequent rains that made the slopes unstable, started after the 40-second tremor struck at 5:02 A.M. local time, Izvestia said. **********In Sharora, ''Some people are weeping and returning their relatives and friends to the earth,'' Tass reported tonight. ''Others, hoping for a miracle, are trying to dig survivors out from under the densely packed layers of sandstone and clay. Everywhere people are weeping and moaning.'' Farming Settlement Hit First **********Grigory D. Kleinman, a reporter for the daily Russian-language newspaper Kommunist Tadzhikistana, said that the nearby settlement of Okuli-Olo, where 70 farm families lived, had been hit first, and that everybody there had been killed. **********An hour and a half later, the mud flow reached Kulipoyen, which had been largely evacuated by then, Mr. Kleinman said. **********Tass said the landslide was about two kilometers long - more than a mile - and wider than it was long. Mr. Kleinman said tonight it was still moving, slowly. **********''Small buildings made from earth were hit especially hard,'' Tass said. ''Dozens of kilometers of highways and communication lines were destroyed and thousands of cattle were buried. Rescue teams from Dushanbe and nearby areas are working in the stricken district.'' **********Zalida Davidbekova, an official of the Red Crescent Society in Dushanbe, which is heavily Muslim, said that it was difficult to determine how many people lay under the mudslide. ''There was a wedding over the weekend in one of the villages and neighbors and relatives from all over were staying there,'' she said. **********Mr. Kleinman reported that buildings in Dushanbe were being checked for structural soundness.  [ American experts said the latest earthquake rated 5.5 on the Richter scale. The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. ]  Seismically Active Region An earthquake in the early part of this century killed 40,000 people in Tadzhikistan, among the most seismically active regions in the world. **********Soviet authorities estimated the population of the republic at 4.8 million in 1987, with most of them living in rural areas. The Tadzhik language and culture are related to those of the tribes of Afghanistan, just to the south. **********Tass first reported today's earthquake about eight hours after it occurred, saying that there had been ''destruction and casualties.'' Five hours later, it followed with a report that gave more details and said that ''the overall death toll is currently estimated at up to 1,000.'' This evening a dispatch from Dushanbe by a Tass correspondent, Galina Gridneva, said that the figure of 1,000 was only preliminary and could go higher. **********When the earthquake struck Armenia, Tass first reported only that ''many people'' had been killed. **********This time the initial reporting has been more specific. Soviet officials in Armenia and Moscow were surprised and apparently greatly affected by the international response to the Armenian disaster, and may have concluded that being open about the extent of this one might also help the state. **********Mr. Gorbachev sent expressions of sympathy to Tadzhikistan today, Soviet television said, and the republic's Communist Party first secretary, Kakhor Makhkamov, took charge of a Government commission to oversee rescue and relief efforts. **********Tass also reported today that Armenian specialists were predicting an earthquake of about the strength of today's in the area still suffering from last month's disaster, in the Razdan and Aparan regions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/01/business/company-news-bausch-lomb-at-sales-peak.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bausch & Lomb At Sales Peak", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bausch & Lomb At Sales Peak", "body_text": " **********Bausch & Lomb Inc. said it would give its employees a day off to celebrate passing the $1 billion sales level.

Kerr, president of The New York Times Company Magazine Group, said that the acquisition would strengthen the marketing position of The Times within the highly competitive women's service magazine field. **********By selling advertising as part of a package with Family Circle, which is part of The Times Magazine Group, the company will be able to compete more effectively with the other women's service magazine giants: the Hearst Corporation, which owns Good Housekeeping and Redbook, and the Meredith Corporation, owner of Better Homes & Gardens and The Ladies' Home Journal. 'A Very Good Move' **********''Strategically, I think it was a very good move,'' said Susan L. Decker, a publishing analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. **********McCall's, which was founded in 1876 by James and Belle McCall, has tried to separate itself from other women's service magazines by focusing on a somewhat more affluent readership and reporting on issues other than food, family and the home. **********The magazine is published monthly and reported circulation of 5.1 million, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations report for the six-month period ended Dec. 31, 1988. In that period, Family Circle, which is published 17 times a year, reported circulation of 5.9 million. **********By pairing the circulation of McCall's and Family Circle, The Times Magazine Group will be able to offer advertisers paid circulation of more than 11 million. Readership is generally considered to be much greater because more than one person reads each copy of a magazine. #30.4 Million Readers According to a recent report by Mediamark Research Inc., which analyzes magazine readership, the combined magazines have a net, unduplicated audience of 30.4 million readers. Mr. Kerr said that this represented almost one-third of the adult women in the United States. **********The two Meredith magazines reported a combined circulation of 13.2 million, according to the Audit Bureau, and the two Hearst publications reported circulation of 9.2 million. **********These magazines, together with Woman's Day, are known as the Seven Sisters, which have long dominated the woman's service magazine field. **********Woman's Day, which is owned by Diamandis Communications Inc., has a circulation of 5.6 million, according to the Audit Bureau. Last year Hachette S.A., the French communications conglomerate, acquired Diamandis for $712 million. About two weeks ago, Diamandis made an offer for McCall's that was rejected as inadequate. **********The Times Company came to terms with the owners of McCall's only after efforts by Diamandis to acquire the magazine collapsed about 10 days ago. **********The likely sale of McCall's to Diamandis had been widely reported, and was considered by some magazine analysts to be a coup that would have isolated Family Circle as the only member of the Seven Sisters to stand alone. **********Mr. Lang, one of McCall's owners, said that the Diamandis offer was too low. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, the Diamandis bid was for about $120 million, with about $40 million of that to be refunded in compensation for subscription liabilities -the value of magazines that McCall's has already been paid for by subscribers, and must be delivered over the coming months. **********The offer was further reduced by an additional $5 million to $10 million in compensation for other assets that were to be converted to cash, putting the net price between $70 million and $80 million. **********Mr. Lang said yesterday that the failure of Diamandis to offer an acceptable price was ''astounding to me.'' **********Phyllis Crawley, a spokesman for Diamandis, said the company had no comment about the deal announced yesterday. **********Although Mr. Lang declined to give any specifics, he said that The Times Magazine Group had ''bettered'' the Diamandis offer, and had ''come close'' to what he and Time Inc. had set as the price they wanted. Mr. Lang and Time formed Working Woman/McCall's Group in 1986. **********The added reach of a larger readership is increasingly valued by marketers of packaged goods because they are accustomed to reaching the huge audiences that television has traditionally provided. With the fragmentation of the television audience by cable and the increasing number of women who are not home in the daytime, the once moribund field of mass-market magazines is showing signs of resurgence. Ad Pages Expected to Rise **********According to Mr. Kerr, overall advertising pages for the Seven Sisters are projected to increase 10 percent this year, after a decade of flat sales. **********Before The Times Magazine Group had been given access to any of the circulation and financial data that would be used to calculate a purchase price, McCall's announced that Diamandis had been given the exclusive opportunity to make a pre-emptive bid, effectively shutting out The Times Magazine Group. **********With the acquisition of McCall's, The Times Magazine Group will consist of Golf Digest, Tennis, Sailing World and 13 other magazines. **********The Times Company's class A share rose 12.5 cents yesterday, to $30.25 on the American Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/world/transition-in-washington-bush-to-meet-un-chief.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush to Meet U.N.

Mr. Jiang, who is 63 years old, officially becomes the fourth top military leader in half a century, succeeding Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and Mr. Deng. **********Winning the military post does not insure that Mr. Jiang will be able to succeed Mr. Deng as China's top leader, according to both diplomats and Chinese officials. But it does position him for the expected succession fight once Mr. Deng is gone from the scene. Effect Is Unclear **********Well-placed Chinese say that Mr. Jiang still owes his rise to his friendship with Mr. Deng and with another aging leader, Chen Yun, and it is not clear whether Mr. Jiang will be able to maintain his status after Mr. Deng dies or is incapacitated. Some diplomats and Chinese compare Mr. Jiang to Mr. Hua, whom Mao favored as heir and who rose rapidly in the late 1970's to become both party leader and head of the military commission. After a power struggle, Mr. Deng wrested effective control from Mr. Hua just two years after Mao died. **********It is also unclear what practical effect Mr. Deng's retirement as chairman of the military commission will have on China's future. In the last decade of his career, Mr. Deng transformed life in China, containing more than a fifth of the world's population. And although he is 85 years old, Mr. Deng still towers over China's political process, and he is likely to be consulted regularly and treated deferentially by those in office. And his spacious estate in the center of the capital may be a rallying center for any factions that are dissatisfied with his successors. **********The resignation, which was accepted by a Central Committee meeting that ended today, does not diminish him as a national figure of importance, but it does mark the formal end of his career as a party leader: as a brilliant peasant organizer and guerrilla strategist, as a dogged political tactician who was purged three times yet each time clawed his way back to power, and as the architect of China's renaissance of the 1980's - and of the crackdown last June when the renaissance threatened to get out of control. Viewed as Largely Symbolic **********Many Chinese officials say that Mr. Deng's resignation will be largely symbolic, for they believe that so long as he is alive he will remain the ultimate arbiter of the political process. Mr. Deng's power in the last decade has depended less on his formal posts -which have tended to be secondary ones - than on his immense prestige and on the universal acknowledgement that whatever his titles, he is the most important person in China. **********But if Mr. Deng really does withdraw from politics, and spend time on his favorite pastimes such as bridge and swimming, he may help break the tradition of Chinese leaders ruling like emperors, until they die. His resignation may also hasten the transition to a younger generation of Chinese leaders who came of age not as guerrrila fighters establishing a Communist state in 1949, but as university students and who are concerned more with rapid modernization than with ideology. **********Mr. Deng's letter of resignation said that the Central Committee last summer had chosen a new ''leadership core'' headed by Mr. Jiang, and that it was working effectively. He said that for some time he had wanted to hand over power to a younger generation. **********''After careful consideration, I wish to resign from the present post while I am still healthy and achieve my long-cherished desire,'' Mr. Deng said in the letter. ''This is in the interests of the party, the state and the army.'' Not a Great Surprise **********The resignation of Mr. Deng, was not a great surprise, although not everyone expected it to come so soon. Mr. Deng had said previously that he wanted to retire and word had spread through the party bureaucracy in the spring that he intended to leave the military post in late May. The anti-Government protests apparently disrupted those plans and led to the rise of Mr. Jiang, who at the time was party boss of Shanghai. **********More surprising than Mr. Deng's resignation was the selection of Mr. Jiang as his replacement. The promotion was a remarkable triumph for Mr. Jiang, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise since he was named national party leader in June. An engineer and linguist, Mr. Jiang has a reputation as an economic moderate. But Mr. Jiang has taken a firm line on political and ideological issues and he strongly resisted the democracy movement. **********There were several other candidates for the chairmanship of the military commission, and Mr. Jiang's nomination had faced some resistance from the military because he has no army background, Chinese officials say. **********Mr. Deng was shown on television tonight greeting Central Committee members and thanking them for allowing him to retire. He walked unassisted and seemed healthier than in some other recent appearances. 'Deepening the Reforms **********The announcement of Mr. Deng's resignation came on the closing day of a long-anticipated meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee. The meeting also approved a statement of economic policy, endorsing the current plan of austerity and retrenchment and saying that it will last at least through 1991. The statement repeatedly referred to ''deepening the reforms'' but did not specify any new policies to carry this out. **********The tone of the communique was somewhat more enthusiastic about economics and development than some other recent statements from the leadership. In particular, the communique said that the basic policies of the special economic zones and open areas on the coast would not change, and it did not emphasize central planning or a crackdown on the private sector, as other documents have. **********In particular, the Central Committee called for emphasis in four areas: first, tightening credit and consumption; second, readjusting the industrial structure and promoting agricultural production; third, rectifying various companies that are engaged in speculation rather than production, and fourth, raising technological standards and practicing austerity while trying to increase production. A 4-Day Meeting **********The announcement of the Central Committee meeting, which lasted four days, did not indicate if there was any discussion or decision about the ousted party leader, Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Zhao, a proponent of further political and economic liberalization, was ousted in May after he refused to crack down on the student protests. **********''If they were going to strip Zhao of his party membership, this would have been a time to do it,'' said a China analyst in the United States. If such an action had been taken, it probably would have been announced, and the apparent failure to punish Mr. Zhao further may reflect a defeat for the hard-liners who wanted to carry on the attack. **********The meeting, known as the fifth plenum of the 13th Central Committee, also approved a series of other changes in the military commission. These will substantially increase the power of President Yang Shangkun and his family. **********Mr. Yang, an 82-year-old longtime associate of Mr. Deng, was named to succeed Mr. Zhao as first vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Mr. Yang's former post as secretary general of the commission will be filled by his younger brother, Yang Baibing, 69. The younger brother was also named to a post on the Central Committee's secretariat, which is in charge of much of the party's daily work. Sometimes Called a Rival **********President Yang is sometimes described as a rival of Mr. Deng, and he is often accused of trying to build an empire within the military. But Chinese officials with access to high-level information say there is little antagonism between the two men, and that some of those who are commonly referred to as relatives of the President - like Chi Haotian, chief of the general staff, often described as the President's son-in-law - are not related after all. **********The committee also named Liu Huaqing, 73, a deputy secretary general of the military commission who is known for his technical background and efforts to modernize the army, to be its other vice chairman. The only obvious casualty of the reshuffle was the other deputy secretary general, Hong Xuezhi, 76, who lost his position but was not named to any new post. **********While Mr. Deng has given up his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, he technically will remain head of the Government's Central Military Commission until the National People's Congress meets next March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/13/business/ltv-wins-round-in-pension-fight.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1989-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 471, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LTV Wins Round in Pension Fight", "print_headline": "LTV Wins Round in Pension Fight", "body_text": " **********The Government agency that insures pensions for millions of retired workers cannot force the LTV Corporation to reinstate three steelworker pension plans that the company said it was unable to finance, a Federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled today. **********The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was ''arbitrary and capricious'' in demanding in January 1987 that LTV resume payments to 60,000 retired steelworkers. **********The three funds, which also cover 40,000 active workers, have assets of approximately $1 billion but were underfunded by about $2 billion when LTV began a bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11 of Federal bankruptcy law in July 1986. **********The ruling today, in effect, gave the pension agency another opportunity to make its case against LTV. The three-judge panel, however, said the agency had ignored labor and bankruptcy laws in its original charges against the company, among other errors. **********Judith Bekelman, a spokeswoman for the agency, said officials at the pension agency were ''studying the opinion.'' **********LTV, a large industrial concern with interests in steel, aerospace and energy, reached agreements in principle in March on a repayment plan with bankers of its aerospace unit and creditors of its steel unit on a portion of the company's $7 billion debt.

The two dissenting groups are the parties most strongly oriented toward Western European liberal norms. **********A major result of the negotiations was that they pointed out the disarray of the governing party, which is bargaining for its political future for the first time since it took over Hungary in 1945, as well as the divisions and numerical weakness of the opposition parties. More Democratic Elections **********The agreement, which will be submitted to Parliament next Tuesday in the form of six bills, provides for a more democratic electoral law, a new office of President to replace the virtually powerless Presidential Council, a law legalizing and guaranteeing rights of political parties, a constitutional court and amendments that would liberalize the penal code and rules of criminal proceedings. **********In an effort to persuade all the opposition groups to approve the agreement, the Communists offered concessions in two disputed areas. **********Imre Pozsgay, who leads the Communist delegation in the talks and is the party's candidate for President, said at the outset of the session on Monday that the party would hand over to the Government property valued at about 2 billion forints, or $33 million, with which to finance all the parties' election campaigns. **********He also announced that the party's paramilitary workers' militia would be reduced from 60,000 to 40,000 members next year, its weapons placed under Defense Ministry control and its armed exercises discontinued. Concessions Called Insufficient **********The parties that did not approve the agreement, the Alliance of Free Democrats and the Association of Young Democrats, based their dissent on what they called insufficent concessions as well as other objections enumerated at a news conference today. **********The organizations' spokesmen denounced the agreement to elect a president by popular vote before electing the first democratically chosen Parliament. They said they believed that no voting should take place under present circumstances, in which Communist-imposed rules dominate political life. Electing a powerful president first would put into question the Parliament's powers, the spokesmen said. **********Parliamentary elections must be held by next June, but no date has been fixed. The agreement on Monday said that presidential balloting would be ''desirable'' before the end of this year. **********The two dissenting groups demanded the disbanding of the workers militia, which is widely considered hostile to democratization, and a full accounting of the party's assets instead of accepting the 2 billion forints in property. Mounting Criticism of Party **********The vast holdings of the Communist Party, which for 44 years has had unhampered access to public property, have become a subject of increasing criticism not only from opposition groups but also from the public. **********Many Hungarians have noted that ordinary citizens are becoming more outspoken about their dislike of the Communists but are also extending their suspicion or apathy to the opposition groups. This was reflected at a news conference held by the six signers of the agreement. They disclosed that the estimated total membership of all eight opposition participants in the transition talks fell well short of 70,000 in a nation of 10.6 million people. **********Two organizations of largely nationalist inspiration, the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Independent Smallholders Party, were each said to have about 20,000 members. Another rurally based group, the People's Party, has about 7,000 members. The nationalist Bajcsy-Zsilinszki Society has 500 members, and the Christian Democratic People's Party has 1,000 to 2,000. **********On the left, the Social Democrats were credited with 9,000 to 10,000 members. The two dissenting organizations, the Free Democrats and Young Democrats, were said to have 3,000 to 4,000 members each. The Free Democrats are a continuation of the former clandestine dissident movement, and the Young Democrats formed in the universities in opposition to the Communist Youth Organization. Declining Membership **********The Communist Party, whose membership is steadily declining, numbers about 700,000. **********The two dissenting organizations also objected to what they called continued Communist domination of more than 90 percent of the press and the party's refusal to dissolve its cells at places of work. Under Communist rule, party organizations in enterprises have exercised great power over workers and management. **********Among the six signers, the Social Democrats stipulated that they, too, opposed the election of a president before voting for Parliament. The five other signers said that, like the dissenters, they opposed the workers militia and regretted the presence of party cells in the workplace. But in a joint statement, they stressed the need to bring the transition period to an end ''because turmoil continues to impair the political, social and economic fabric.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/business/business-digest-saturday-november-11-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1989", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1989", "body_text": " **********Companies **********The chairman of Ford will retire on March 1, about a year and a half earlier than expected.

Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who requested the documents, said the data show that ''we may be as vulnerable to a meltdown in the 21st century as we were in 1979.'' **********Only 24 of the nation's 112 licensed commercial reactors have completed all 149 changes outlined in the Three Mile Island Action Plan, drafted in the wake of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. The Pennsylvania plant suffered a partial core meltdown on March 28, 1979. **********Of the 88 reactors not in compliance, 54 do not plan to complete all the safety changes by the end of this year, and several will not finish until ''well into the 1990's,'' Representative Markey said. Many Requirements Top Priority **********While some of the safety requirements were minor, others had been labeled top priority by the commission and given deadlines that have long passed, notably in the case of some improvements in control rooms and instruments. **********N.R.C. officials defended their performance, saying reactors have made 97.5 percent of the post-Three Mile Island changes. **********Mr. Markey rejected that contention. ''Nuclear power isn't horseshoes,'' he said. ''The difference between coming close and getting the job done can mean the difference between safety and catastrophe.'' **********Thomas Murley, director of nuclear reactor regulation, conceded the record could be better on the safety changes. **********''When you look back at 10 years, it's hard for me to justify it,'' Mr. Murley said. ''But we have to make safety judgments all the time. We're satisfied that we can operate the plants safely.'' Cost of $50 Million a Plant **********Mr. Murley said part of the problem arose from putting too many requirements on the nuclear industry in the wake of Three Mile Island and then not giving utilities enough time to implement them. The changes mandated by the Three Mile Island report cost each plant an average of $50 million, he said. **********''We were overly optimistic,'' Mr. Murley said in an interview Friday. ''We did not properly estimate the amount of work that it was going to take the plants.'' **********He also said if the N.R.C. ''had to go through this again, we would be more discriminating on what is required.'' He added: ''I think we laid too much on the industry. Not all the requirements are absolutely necessary.'' **********Nevertheless, Mr. Murley said he believes a half-dozen requirements pointed out by Representative Markey are important, and he vowed to put pressure on the industry to complete those changes. **********''We are going to turn the heat up and require that these will be completed,'' he said. ''We want to know why it's not done.'' Specific Findings **********Among the findings in the N.R.C. documents were: *********** Twenty-three reactors have failed to install display consoles to help reactor operators more quickly determine a plant's safety status. That had been designated a top priority by the N.R.C. after Three Mile Island and was given a deadline of Jan. 1, 1982. *********** Thirteen reactors have not installed instruments specifically to detect core cooling, a requirement that also was given a top priority by the agency. The deadline was Jan. 1, 1981. *********** Nine reactors have failed to install instruments to tell operators about the conditions inside the containment vessels. The deadline was Jan. 1, 1980, and the requirement had the N.R.C.'s top-priority designation. *********** Despite a deadline of Jan. 1, 1983, 63 reactors have not conducted a detailed review of their control room designs to determine whether they are sufficient for operators to handle an accident. *********** Eleven reactors have not tested and analyzed reactor coolant valves and pipes to make sure the equipment is ''qualified for the full range of operating and accident conditions.'' The deadline for this top-priority requirement was July 1, 1981. *********** Five reactors have failed to establish an emergency operations center to coordinate evacuations and emergency operations in case of an accident. The deadline was Jan. 1, 1981. Permits Granted, Standards Unmet Mr. Markey said 25 reactors were licensed and permitted to operate after the Pennsylvania accident without meeting all the post-Three Mile Island requirements, and nine others have restarted or may soon restart without meeting all the standards. **********Mr. Murley said no plants have ever been fined or shut down for not meeting the requirements. **********Representative Markey, in a letter to the N.R.C. chairman, Lando W. Zech Jr., lambasted the commission's actions on the regulations, which stem from a Presidential commission's recommendations. **********''The T.M.I. Action plan was a major test of the commitment of the N.R.C. to public health and safety,'' the letter said. ''It is a test which the N.R.C. has clearly failed.'' **********Mr. Murley, however, defended the commission, saying it has ''made plants substantially safer since Three Mile Island, and that is showing up in all the performance indicators we see.'' **********He added: ''Everything is turning in the right direction. We're confident we've done the right thing.'' Troubled Plants Worst Offenders **********The nation's most troubled plants generally had the most post-Three Mile Island requirements that have gone unmet, the N.R.C. documents showed. **********Each of the three Browns Ferry plants in Alabama have not complied with 22 requirements, including 5 of the 6 listed by Representative Markey. **********San Onofre I in California failed to meet 10 of the regulations, and the Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts, the Shoreham plant on Long Island and Millstone I in Connecticut each failed to meet eight regulations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/business/company-news-america-west-debt-is-purchased.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "America West Debt Is Purchased", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; America West Debt Is Purchased", "body_text": " **********An affiliate of an Australian airline that is partly owned by the publisher Rupert Murdoch has purchased $15.6 million worth of debentures in America West Airlines, maintaining its 19.1 percent stake in the regional carrier based in Tempe, Ariz.

As a result, future software products, while they might still have cosmetic differences, would be far more similar to each other, enabling computer users to master each more readily. **********A victory for Apple would discourage an industry standard and therefore produce continued uncertainty among manufacturers about what control systems should be used in future computers, the executives said. **********In the suit, filed last Thursday, Xerox accused Apple of unlawfully using, in two of its computers, copyrighted Xerox software that controls desktop computers. Xerox also argues that Apple has undermined Xerox's ability to license its own software widely by suing two other companies marketing similar software. **********Xerox contends that such software should be licensed widely to encourage a single industry standard. But Apple has tried to prevent other companies from imitating its software, in an attempt to differentiate its products from those of competitors. An Industry in Transition **********The Xerox-Apple case is particularly important because the computer industry is now in transition, from the equivalent of a manual gearshift to that of an automatic transmission. To simplify the control of desktop computers, the industry is moving from complex sets of commands that must be remembered and typed into the computer, to a ''mouse'' pointing device that allows the computer user to select from a menu of choices. **********Xerox and Apple, as well as I.B.M., Next Inc., Microsoft and other companies, have all designed ''visual interfaces'' - distinctive screens that permit users to control several programs at once with a pointing device. Each company hopes to make its product a popular standard for future desktop computers. **********In cars sold in the United States, every accelerator pedal, speedometer and steering wheel is in basically the same shape and in the same place. People who can drive one kind of car have little trouble driving another. That is not always the case in computers, and some analysts think this is hurting the industry. Parallel Seen **********Some computer industry experts see a parallel between the cases of visual interfaces and another invention by Xerox, a product known as Ethernet that allows computers to talk to each other. Xerox licenses the technology widely, and it has become essentially an industry standard. A similar situation could arise if Xerox wins its case. **********There have been other suits over the appearance of visual interfaces. The Lotus Development Corporation has sued several imitators of its spreadsheet interface. Apple itself sued the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, contending that their interfaces were too similar to those on the Macintosh. **********Apple may face special problems because of admissions made by its chairman, John Sculley, in his 1987 book, ''Odyssey,'' a chronicle of his split with Apple's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs. ''Much of the Macintosh technology wasn't invented in the building,'' he wrote. ''Indeed, the Mac, like the Lisa before it, was largely a conduit for technology developed'' at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. **********The dispute between Apple and Xerox has its roots in the mid-1970's, when Xerox researchers at the research center developed a new class of computer systems that did not require entering complex commands at the keyboard. That research led to the introduction of Xerox's Star work station in 1981. The Star permitted a computer user to use a mouse pointing device to select from a menu of choices. **********Despite enthusiastic reviews, the Star was never a business success because Xerox could never figure out the personal computer market. The company ultimately withdrew from the market. Widely Copied **********But the Star's interface has been widely copied, most successfully by Apple, in its Macintosh computers. Mr. Jobs had been permitted to visit the Xerox laboratory in return for allowing Xerox to invest in one of Apple's last private financing offerings. Mr. Jobs later hired computer researchers away from Xerox to help build personal computers with many of the features he first saw at Xerox. **********The intellectual debt that Apple owes Xerox is almost universally acknowledged. As one example, Bruce Horn, one of two principal designers of the Macintosh ''Finder'' interface, spent some of his youth participating in a program at the Xerox research center to make computers more accessible to children. **********The new suit, therefore, presents Apple with a problem. **********''Apple can't have it both ways,'' said John Shoch, a former Xerox computer scientist involved in the original research at the company's Palo Alto Research Center. ''They can't complain that Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft have the look and feel of the Macintosh without acknowledging the Mac has the look and feel of the Star.'' **********The Xerox suit has also been an occasion for a good deal of talk within the industry that the sharing of information that fosters innovation is giving way to aggressive protection of intellectual property. **********''It's a sign of maturity in the industry when the news is lawsuits instead of new technology,'' said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic, a computer industry newsletter. A Visit Is Questioned **********Others wonder whether Xerox did not cede its right to the technology when it invited Mr. Jobs to visit. ''When they sent him on a tour, what were they thinking of, if they didn't expect him to walk away with the technology?'' said Frank Rose, author of ''West of Eden,'' a history of Apple Computer. **********Both former and current Xerox executives said the company's decision to sue Apple can be attributed almost entirely to the arrival of William C. Lowe, a former executive of the International Business Machines Corporation, who joined Xerox last year. Mr. Lowe, who while at I.B.M. oversaw the early development of the I.B.M. PC, has said in interviews that Xerox is evaluating its technology and will take a much more aggressive stand on patent and copyright issues. Was It a Trap?  Some have suggested that Xerox may have laid a subtle trap for Apple. The lawsuit is not simply a copyright infringement challenge. Xerox has also indirectly attacked Apple's lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard by noting in its suit that that suit has hurt Xerox's chances to license its own technology. **********''Apple is saying, 'We will say who can write this software and determine which PC's it will run on,' '' said David Liddle, chairman of Metaphor Computer Systems Inc., which with Sun Microsystems Inc. has licensed the Xerox software. ''Xerox is saying, 'No, we intend to license this software consistently.' '' **********But the principal irony may ultimately be that Xerox, which invented many of the innovations shaping the personal computer industry today but which failed to capitalize on them in the marketplace, may also lose the suit because it was filed too long after the introduction of the technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/15/business/a-milestone-for-labor-but-no-silver-lining.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1989-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1047, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Milestone for Labor But No Silver Lining", "print_headline": "A Milestone for Labor But No Silver Lining", "body_text": " **********The pending takeover of the UAL Corporation by a group including its pilots' union and its management is a coup for the labor movement. But experts on employee-owned companies say that difficulties even more trying than winning control of the company may lie ahead. **********These experts predicted that conflicts and problems would come not only at the management level, where executives and union leaders would have to work together, but at lower levels, where attempts would be made to motivate workers to improve productivity and involve them more in running the company. **********But the experts also said that employees who own a company could look at problems more as management does. Machinists' Position **********Another big challenge for the management and pilots of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, would be how to handle the 20,000-plus members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the airline, who have so far refused to participate in the buyout. **********Louis R. Schroeder, the president of District 141 of the machinists' union, had urged the UAL board to reject the pilot-management offer because it ''jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force and the long-term viability of the carrier.'' **********If the buyout is approved by shareholders and regulators, the employees at United who participate in the deal would end up owning 75 percent of the company. To translate that sense of ownership into higher productivity has often proved to be a painstaking task that leads to only small results, said Peter Cappelli, an expert on labor relations in the airline industry. Risks Seen for Unions **********Mr. Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, also warned that there were risks for the unions, whose role would be redefined. **********''They can't continue to act as adversaries of management as in the past,'' he added. ''The long-range question for the union is: why would its members want to continue to have it around?'' **********Under the contract to which the pilots agreed as part of the $6.75 billion takeover deal, the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, has agreed to huge changes in its relationship with management. **********That management would be made up mostly of UAL executives like Stephen M. Wolf, the current chairman, who would be president, and John C. Pope, who would remain the chief financial officer. No Strike for 7 Years **********The pilots have promised to give up their ultimate weapon, the strike, for the duration of a seven-year contract, whose length is itself unusual in American industry. The 6,100 pilots at United would also be committed to resolve disputes with the company through binding arbitration. **********Layoffs would also be on hold for seven years. So if a recession were to hurt the industry, United might find it difficult to cut back to ride out hard times. On the other hand, the pilots have agreed to a 10 percent cut in pay and cuts in other benefits. **********Some analysts said it would make little sense for the pilots to strike because they would in effect be striking against themselves. **********The pilots have also promised to cross the lines of other unions, including the machinists, who could continue to play their historical adversarial role. Seemingly Strange Position **********The pilots' and the machinists' unions have been rivals, having fought bitterly in the courts for the three years it took the pilots to get to the stage of board approval of the deal. The machinists' leaders have said that the added debt would weaken the airline and that its members had no interest in becoming owners. **********Thus the new company could find itself in the strange position of having the pilots, and possibly even the flight attendants as well, becoming owners, while the machinists could end up even more alienated. **********To persuade UAL's independent directors to support the bid and to assure that management would not be just a creature of the unions, the pilots' union agreed to a 15-member board on which eight members, a majority, would be independent. **********These members are expected to be business people and professors and may also be drawn from government. **********The pilots would be able to elect at least one of their leaders to the board - expected to be F. C. (Rick) Dubinsky, the chairman of the Master Executive Council, the governing body of the Air Line Pilots Association at United. **********Joseph Blasi, whose specialty has been labor relations at employee-owned companies, said that only when ownership is combined with committees made up of workers and management can productivity be increased. **********''It will be hard, but Stephen Wolf must come forward with detailed plans to radically increase employee involvement,'' he said. **********Mr. Blasi, a professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers who has acted as a consultant for the pilots' union, said the union and Mr. Wolf had already run into differences on how labor-management committees would function at United. **********Setting up the structure for joint cooperation has also often proved simpler than persuading workers and middle managers to participate. The Experience of Avis **********Joseph V. Vittoria, chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc., which has been owned by its employees under an employee stock ownership plan for two years, said that one of the most exhausting parts of his job has been to travel to the widely scattered stations of Avis and explain to employees how they can participate in managing the company. **********Mr. Vittoria has attended hundreds of meetings with small groups of employees and said he has had many instances of success. He recalled that one shop steward, an 18-year union employee, went back to his work area and began to tell workers that certain slack practices would no longer be tolerated. **********Mr. Vittoria said the shop steward told them, ''Either get up to speed or you're gone.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-grey-s-eclipse-car-spots-to-be-seen-on-cable.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Grey's Eclipse Car Spots To Be Seen on Cable", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Grey's Eclipse Car Spots To Be Seen on Cable", "body_text": " **********Grey Advertising said yesterday that it would show its well-publicized 90-second television spots for the Mitsubishi Eclipse on three cable networks - WTBS, MTV and the Arts and Entertainment Network. **********The spots, which were originally shown in movie theaters, depict a smooth-as-silk diamond heist perpetrated by a glamorous couple who use the Eclipse automobile as a getaway car.

The Starship is the first passenger plane to eliminate the metal frame and skin in favor of materials in which plastic has been combined with other substances to form composites. **********Plastic composites are increasingly common in everyday life. They have turned up in recent years in such things as high-performance tennis racquets, golf clubs and skis. But the Starship takes the technology to new levels in embedding substances in a plastic matrix to form materials that have been engineered for high strength and light weight. **********Composites are increasingly being substituted for metals as technology developed for the space program, including the space shuttle and such advanced projects as the national aerospace plane, and for military equipment trickles into the civil sector. 2.7 Billion Pounds Produced The Composites Institute, a trade group, said 2.7 billion pounds of composite materials were produced by American manufacturers last year, up 5.1 percent from 1987. **********Some companies see composites as an important growth sector and are planning to expand their use. J. Michael Bowman, head of the composites division of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, said the composite industry's sales could grow to $20 billion by 2000, from $2 billion a year now. **********But there are fears that other countries may be moving more aggressively in applying new materials to commercial products. **********A report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment last year warned that ''end-user companies in several countries, notably Japan, have initiated more aggressive programs to commercialize their evolving materials technologies, and have succeeded in bringing some advanced material products to the market years in advance of comparable U.S. products.'' For example, Japanese companies have been more aggressive in the introduction of products based on advanced ceramic materials. **********Researchers are investigating exotic metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic composites to develop materials that will withstand high temperatures, like those to be encountered in the next generation of jet fighter engines and in the proposed National Aero Space plane. **********Composites are also changing traditional manufacturing methods and blurring the distinct roles of product designers, factory engineers and materials suppliers. ''For thousands of years we worked with monolithic materials that were machined down to size,'' said Paul R. Hoffman, president of Textron Inc.'s specialty materials subsidiary. ''With composites, we build up to the final part, so we have to integrate design with manufacturing.'' **********Composites combine two or more materials to enhance the properties of each. Typically, a stiff and strong but brittle fiber is embedded in a plastic matrix. Some of the most commonly used fibers are carbon, glass, boron and synthetic materials, like Du Pont's Kevlar. **********The concept is hardly new. Ancient builders in the Middle East added chopped straw to the mud used for bricks. The straw aided the evaporation of moisture from within the brick during heating and helped distribute cracks evenly. Steel reinforcing rods in concrete are another example of a composite material. **********In most modern composites, the fiber bears the mechanical load of an application while the plastic distributes the load and holds the shape of the part. Since the fibers typically are several times as stong as steel on an equal weight basis, composites can be used in demanding structural applications, like Beech's Starship. Indeed, composites have replaced metal in the basic structures of Formula One and Indianapolis-style racing cars. **********Composites have other advantages over traditional materials. For one, they can be formed into almost any shape, and the size of composite parts is limited only by the size of the pressurized ovens needed to bond the materials together. **********On the Starship, for example, the fuselage is molded in two halves that are bonded together, not unlike a model airplane. The main wing is formed in upper and lower skins, which are joined by an internal structure. **********One result of this ability to make large structures is a dramatic drop in the number of parts needed for a product. The Starship, a Beech spokesman said, has 2,600 parts, compared with 10,000 in a similar metal plane. **********Molding the large shapes for the Starship also eliminates the rivets that increase drag in older aircraft. And the lighter weight of the composite materials permits a larger cabin. **********Composites come in two basic varieties. In simpler applications, the reinforcing fibers are chopped into short lengths and distributed throughout the plastic matrix. This imparts some of the properties of the reinforcement to the material. **********But in applications requiring more strength and stiffness, the fibers are continuous and often loosely woven into tapes or cloth for ease of handling. By orienting the direction and quantity of the fibers, product designers can build in strength where it is needed and save money by eliminating the reinforcing where it is not. **********''We are in the age of designer materials,'' Mr. Bowman said. ''You put properties where you want them and don't waste properties you do not need. There are a lot of things you can do with them that you can't with monolithic materials.'' **********The fibers can even be woven into three-dimensional shapes, and gaps between the fibers are filled in by gaseous deposition of the matrix material. This is how the carbon-carbon brake disks coming into use in commercial aviation are fabricated. **********Mr. Bowman said composites can provide for ''specific solutions'' to design problems rather than the ''general solutions'' offered by older types of materials, like nylon or Teflon. Composite materials are tailored to each application, rather than leaving it to manufacturers to figure out how to apply a homogeneous materal. **********But the materials have drawbacks. They are expensive and require long curing times. In addition, the hand labor involved in their fabrication can be substantial. Curing times measured in hours might be acceptable in a low-volume industry like aircraft, but would be prohibitive in auto manufacturing. **********Composite producers also acknowledge that most product designers are more comfortable working with metal, and the large investment that companies have in metal-working equipment tends to inhibit a switch to new materials. New applications are most likely, they say, in problem areas where conventional materials are inadequate. **********Most composites in use consist of plastics as the matrix. But plastics are limited by the amount of heat they can withstand and are of little use above 500 degrees Fahrenheit. **********That rules them and most metals out for high-temperature uses in advanced engines and ultra-high-speed aircraft. To push the boundaries of materials technology, the Federal Government is backing efforts to develop rapidly cooled metal alloys, carbon-carbon, metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic materials that hold their strength at temperatures up to 3,000 degrees. **********Textron has developed a process to produce continuous silicon carbide fibers by depositing the ceramic on a carbon filament core. The resulting fibers are loosely woven into a clothlike sheet, sandwiched between thin foils of aluminum or titanium and heated under pressure until the metal flows and forms a unified piece. **********The ability of the fiber to withstand heat enables the composite to be used in areas where unreinforced metal alone would fail. Textron said that silicon carbide titanium was stronger at 1,000 degrees than the unreinforced metal at room temperature. **********But at the current volume of production, the cost of the fiber is high -$2,500 for 30,000 feet of the fiber, an amount that weighs one pound. While the cost would decline sharply as production increased, economics are secondary to technology. **********''At this stage engineers are a lot more concerned with simply finding something that works,'' said Thomas J. Yost, a composites specialist at the Corning Glass Works. ''We are looking for what are known as 'mission enabling' materials.''  Making Plastic Passenger Planes  Beech Aircraft's Starship, which will begin commercial use next summer, is made of plastic composites, materials in which a structural fiber is embedded in a plastic matrix. The Starship composite is made of heat-treated graphite placed in an epoxy matrix. Shown below are the steps to form a piece of the aircraft skin that replaces the traditional metal frame and skin.  CARBON FIBER FORMED: The fibers are then heat treated to increase their strength and stiffness.  FIBERS WOVEN INTO CLOTH: The type of the weave varies, depending on the nature of the airplane part.  EPOXY RESINS ADDED TO FABRIC: Dry sheets of the cloth are filled with the plastic matrix material and stored at low temperatures until ready for use.  COMPOSITE SANDWICH CREATED: The filled cloth is applied to both sides of a lightweight honeycomb-like plastic core material that provides bulk and added strength to the part."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/01/business/us-eases-rules-on-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Eases Rules on China", "print_headline": "U.S. Eases Rules on China", "body_text": " **********The United States has eased its restrictions on technology shipments to China, the Commerce Department said today. **********It said the relaxed export restrictions, reflecting closer ties with China, would include trade in telecommunications equipment and electronics and precision instruments. **********The department said the eased controls were agreed to in September by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, formed after World War II to curb the exports of advanced technology to Communist nations. **********Paul Freedenberg, the Under Secretary for Export Administration, said China's $370 billion economy needed basic technology to meet its development needs and market objectives.

So far at least, the diversified entertainment company, of which Mr. Redstone now owns 83 percent, is largely intact: there have not been broad asset sales or extensive layoffs, and crippling debt has not destroyed internal growth. **********More importantly, the stock is up. After Mr. Redstone bought the company in 1987, the publicly traded securities were selling at $20 a share. In the wake of the October 1987 market crash, the stock dropped as low as $10. Since then, it has rebounded nearly sixfold, closing Friday at $55 1/2. **********Today, Viacom's market capitalization, the value of its stock, is about $5.2 billion, or $1.3 billion more than it was in 1987. While it is well known that Mr. Redstone is interested in a merger, primarily one that would include a movie studio, other scenarios are possible. He also wants to retain a great deal of control, which has created some confusion on Wall Street. Many leading shareholders expect some sort of merger, but just how to pull one off leaving Mr. Redstone on top is the major impediment. **********''Bulls will tell you the private market value of the company is $80 a share and bears will tell you it is $70, but it is selling at a relatively high price, unless you think there will be a buyout,'' said Ezra Merkin of Ariel Capital Inc., an investment firm.  There Are Problems **********Certainly, Viacom has its share of problems. It has not developed any new businesses, and some of its existing operations, such as Showtime, are struggling. A television station that had been put up for sale was recently withdrawn because of a soft market. And the company is engaged in a messy battle with Home Box Office, which it has sued for $2.4 billion, charging antitrust practices against Showtime. Recently, talk of re-regulation has pummeled cable stocks, and should re-regulation come to pass, Viacom's value would be adversely affected. But none of these factors are likely to detract very much from the growing value of Viacom's core businesses. **********There are a handful of reasons for Mr. Redstone's apparent success. Most important, he saw values in Viacom that many others did not. Mr. Redstone built his fortune by owning movie theaters and the real estate underneath them. But ''despite all the hype, motion picture growth was a limited business,'' he said in an interview in his New York offices. ''Even when I was in exhibition, I always knew that software programming was king. I had a gut feeling about its importance. I didn't think the movie theater business had growth potential. Growth was moving from theaters to home entertainment. Viacom was in home entertainment. That was the flip side of nongrowth.'' **********While building his theater chain, Mr. Redstone was making periodic investments in movie production companies. He owned about 5 percent of 20th Century-Fox, almost 10 percent of Columbia Pictures, about 8 percent of MGM/UA Home Entertainment and a small stake in Orion Pictures. All in all, he made about $65 million from those investments. **********Mr. Redstone appears to be the unusual entrepreneur who has made the transition to manager and who has not felt the compulsion to act immediately to leave his mark. Unlike his longtime friend Lawrence Tisch, who began restructuring CBS by selling assets, Mr. Redstone resisted selling. The values of Viacom's assets have generally appreciated. **********''I learned a hell of a lot from would-be partners,'' Mr. Redstone recalled. One was Charles Dolan, head of Cablevision Systems Inc., the Long Island-based cable operator, who in 1987 wanted to buy an interest in the company. ''When he came to us, he said he could stretch and pay about $1,300 a cable subscriber,'' Mr. Redstone recalled. ''As we talked I began to learn about cable and cable subscribers. It was a totally new field to me. He gave me some education.'' **********Mr. Redstone said he had also talked to Columbia, Disney and MCA about potential partnerships. ''From the film companies I learned about the company, its personnel and about pay television,'' Mr. Redstone said. **********But he did not set out to dismantle Viacom as some takeover buyers plan. ''I never thought of liquidating,'' he said. ''I fought against every bank covenant compelling asset disposition. I cannot remember ever selling a movie theater. I liked the idea of a diversified company.'' **********Despite his reputation as a ''hands on'' manager at his Boston-based National Amusements Inc., one of the nation's largest movie theater chains, Mr. Redstone, a lawyer by training, brought experienced people to Viacom and let them run its businesses. **********Lawyers and bankers who have worked with him say he does not delegate easily. As one lawyer recalled, ''Sumner used to call me at 6 A.M. on a deal, and say 'I am not a lawyer, but I've been thinking about this point and . . .' '' **********At restaurants he has been known to order for others, certain he knows what's best. Or as he jokingly justifies it: ''If you want a lousy meal, you can order it yourself.'' **********And while he says he would like to control the company from the grave, he has been able to hire strong executives, including his president, Frank Biondi Jr., and establish successful working relationships. **********Mr. Redstone also proved to be a stubborn negotiator in structuring the deal that he initially wanted. Although Viacom was his first takeover attempt, he avoided using the high-yield, high-risk bonds whose debt service has weakened others.  Timing Was a Factor **********Ken Miller, Mr. Redstone's investment banker then, is now president of the Lodestar Group. ''Sumner knew nothing about this business,'' said Mr. Miller. ''He had never borrowed money before. He did not take it as a given that he had to use junk bonds. I think it served him well.'' **********The fact is that Mr. Redstone also benefitted from timing. When he bought Viacom the banks were particularly aggressive about getting into the leveraged buyout business. Another boon was the sale of the rerun rights to ''The Cosby Show.'' Viacom got about $4 million an episode for 125 episodes or a total of more than $500 million in cash, to be paid over three and a half years. **********He put up about $450 million of his own money for the June 1987 deal to buy Viacom, which also involved $2.2 billion of bank debt. The bank debt covenants were stringent. Viacom would have to sell $450 million in assets within two years. But 11 months later, Viacom refinanced. In Mr. Biondi's view, a turning point came in July 1988, when the company swapped $500 million of bank debt for junk bonds at 11.6 percent interest, an unusually low rate. **********''We are still a highly leveraged company and we cannot afford to make a lot of mistakes,'' Mr. Biondi said, ''but we are out of the woods.'' Among other things, the refinancing removed any requirement for asset sales. That was in part because Viacom had already indicated it planned to sell part of its cable operations. Initially the banks had targeted either Showtime or MTV for sale, but Viacom convinced the banks that cable assets made a better choice. **********Just two years after he had bought Viacom and Mr. Dolan had been willing to pay $1,300 a cable subscriber, Mr. Redstone sold Mr. Dolan a portion of Viacom's cable operations for about $2,800 a subscriber, a total of $545 million. The sale of the cable subscribers, together with the $44 million sale of Viacom's holdings in Orion Pictures, brought Viacom about $600 million by early 1989. This helped reduce bank debt from $1.7 billion to about $1.2 billion, according to Viacom's treasurer, Tom Dooley. **********Meanwhile, most of the company's core businesses, particularly its radio business, are doing well. The biggest surprise has been the growing value of MTV: Music Television and Nickelodeon, the advertiser-supported children's television service. At the time Mr. Redstone bought the company, MTV in particular was considered a trendy service that might not survive. Instead it has prospered. Operating income for the MTV Networks, which includes MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1, is up 25 percent, to $100 million for 1989.  Tuning in MTV **********Larry Gerbrandt, a cable programming analyst for Paul Kagan & Associates, a media consulting firm, believes that Tom Freston, the chairman of MTV Networks, has been instrumental in developing programs that keep audiences tuned in. ''Their biggest problem was that people dip in and out of MTV,'' he said. ''The longer shows hold them. It has helped stabilize ratings.'' The biggest problem at Viacom as a whole is at Showtime, a half interest of which was recently sold to Tele-Communications, the cable operator. It has always run a shaky second to Home Box Office. **********What is impossible to know is how Viacom would have done had there been no leveraged buyout. It is not clear that prior management could have solved its problems even without capital investment restrictions. **********Paul Kagan, president of the consulting firm, argues that Showtime has always had what he calls the ''Avis'' problem. That is a considerable handicap, particularly since HBO's parent, Time Inc., has merged with Warner Communications. And overall, the pay television business has been hurt by home video. **********Tony Cox, chairman of Showtime Networks Inc., recalled what Michael Fuchs, the president of HBO, told him about the battle to get film scripts for the pay services: ''Just remember, any original show that you get is only because we have already passed on it.'' And to Mr. Cox, the merger has not made life at Showtime any easier. ''Time Warner can always say to someone like Gary Shandling: 'Why not come to HBO, and by the way, are you interested in making a movie at Warner Brothers.' '' **********Mr. Fuchs had a tart response about this. ''Showtime is building some kind of a legal case,'' he said. ''They are crybabies. Size does not mean so much. And we are not offering stars movies so fast. When is the last time they lost someone to us? I'm tired of hearing those guys moan.'' **********The two sides are attempting to settle the lawsuit, and they could end up merging their competing comedy channels. Meanwhile, Viacom has continued to buy radio stations. It has not yet concluded any innovative deals in other areas. And it may be that the big deal it finally chooses will be a merger with another company. **********But Mr. Redstone maintains that he does not want to turn his assets to cash and hopes to leave the company to his children. ''We will not do anything if it means losing control,'' he said. Although neither his son nor his daughter, both lawyers married to lawyers, now take much of a role in Viacom, he says they have indicated an interest in doing so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/04/business/business-digest-783889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 795, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY  Steel prices have fallen to their lowest point in nearly two years, reflecting softer demand from automobile producers and appliance makers.

That done, the 29-year-old Englishman and a companion, Paul Jefferson, cleared another, smaller minefield nearby. **********Back in Kabul, Mr. Willoughby, great-grandson of a former viceroy of India, departed for a vacation in England, where his passions include horse breeding and polo. **********Mr. Willoughby, director of a London-based group that calls itself the Hazardous Areas Life-Support Organization - the initials are HALO - will be back, planning for a role in what is likely to be the most complicated mine-clearing operation ever undertaken. **********By its estimates and that of other organizations that have assessed the problem, including the United Nations, 10 years of war have left at least three million unexploded mines lying in the mountain gulleys and hardscrabble tracts of Afghanistan. Children Are Prominent Victims **********More than any other weapon, mines have been the scourge of the war, maiming and killing tens of thousands of people. The hospitals of Kabul and other cities are filled to the corridors with victims, many of them children who last limbs and eyes when they accidentally triggered one of the deadly explosives scattered across the country by Soviet forces and their Afghan Government allies, or by the Muslim guerrillas who have opposed them. **********Even when the war ends, the dying will not. According to Alexander Blyth, Mr. Willoughby's assistant here, poor mapping of many minefields - and the failure to map many of them at all -will create huge problems. **********Because of the heavy spring runoff of rain from the Hindu Kush mountains, many of the mines that have been mapped have moved, perhaps as much as a mile from their original positions. ''It could be 20 or 30 years before the problem is under control'' said Mr. Blyth, 28 years old, and like Mr. Willoughby, a former Guards officer. **********For the moment, there is little to be done. The clearing done by the two men south of the town of Pul-i-Khumri, along the Salang highway that connects Kabul to the Soviet Union, was to test the accuracy of Soviet mine maps and to show the Afghan Army's engineering corps how the job is done. The Kabul forces have little experience in lifting mines, and scarcely any incentive as long as the war continues, to begin the work. There is also little faith that the job can be done safely. **********''Afghans hate mines,'' Mr. Blyth said.'' Their instinct is to get as far away from them as posssible.'' Little Soviet Instruction **********The mine maps that do exist were delivered to the Afghans by the Soviet forces 48 hours before the Soviet troops pulled out in February, with little or no attempt, according to Afghan officers, to explain them. Mr. Willoughby has seen the maps, and photographed many of them, creating an archive that could be crucial if fighting should threaten the Government's records. But the indications from the Pul-i-Khumri experiment suggest that many of the maps may be of limited value. **********''It was very much a matter of the diligence of the individual Soviet field commander,'' Mr. Blyth said. ''Some of them just planted the mines and forgot about them, without any record at all. Others drew very inaccurate maps, and there were those who did the job responsibly.'' **********In laying mines, that involves observance of the Geneva conventions on warfare, which require combatants to map and mark all minefields, and to surround them, usually with barbed wire. **********Soviet mines account for the majority of those distributed around the country, and the rebels have made widespread use of them. The result is a hodgepodge of mine types, from huge Soviet devices that can be hung in trees to American claymores, Italian plastic mines that have acoustic-detonation mechanisms and Chinese copies of Soviet devices dating to World War II. Belgian, British and Swedish mines have found their way here, too. A Particularly Insidious Kind **********As in Vietnam, extensive use has also been made of booby traps in dolls, toys, pens and matchboxes. **********But the biggest problem has arisen from the Soviet practice of airdropping mines, generally in canisters that exploded in the air and scattered up to 360 tiny ''butterfly'' mines. Many of the mines lacked the timing devices that are supposed to disarm them after a 24-to-48-hour period, and in others, the timing mechanisms failed. **********Worse, the Soviet forces appear to have kept no maps of the airdropped devices. Almost every day brings more childern to Kabul's hospitals who have lost limbs after picking up green-and-brown explosives that are about the size and weight of cigarette packages. **********In Pakistan, American and British experts, among others, are training Afghan refugees to recognize and disarm mines. But the British organization, so far, is the only foreign group to have seen the mine maps, and the only one to have attempted to work through the Kabul Government. With suspicion abounding on every side, it has faced an uphill battle. **********''People see these former British officers heading for the Defense Ministry with their briefcases, and they jump to conclusions,'' Mr. Blyth said.

Firms See Need to Change Rules **********Because of such incidents, many firms argue that the rules governing the nation's roughly 300,000 certified public accountants badly need changing. Partly because of their lobbying and partly out of a desire to harmonize United States accounting regulations with those abroad, the S.E.C. on Sept. 14 promised a review within six months. The current rules cover everything from outside business relationships to family ties. **********Supporters of change hope that the arrival of Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C.'s new chairman, will help their case. Still, a big overhaul seems unlikely. The rules were established a half-century ago with a strong purpose: to insure the integrity of the people who audit the books of companies. And the commission's staff has historically questioned whether the public will gain from relaxing the rules. **********''We basically gave these guys a franchise to audit public enterprises, and there are certain costs associated with that,'' said John Riley, the commission's associate chief accountant. Restraining Competition **********For their part, the accounting firms argue that the current do's and don'ts harm the public by restraining competition. ''That's an argument that is difficult for them to make,'' said Mr. Riley, noting that there are usually plenty of accounting firms ready to fill in if one is disqualified. **********Indeed, in December, the commission, on the recommendation of its staff, rejected a proposal backed by the eight top firms that would have made it easier for accountants to work jointly with audit clients on consulting jobs. The firms filed an amended proposal in May, which the staff is now studying, The firms have some influential theorists on their side. For instance, John C. Burton, a former chief accountant of the S.E.C. who now teaches accounting at Columbia University's business school, argues that the public might benefit from giving accounting firms more freedom to delve into consulting. This, he said, could help disclose problems that the auditors would otherwise miss. **********''It seems to me the more information the auditor has, the better,'' Professor Burton said, ''as long as you don't get to that point where the joint relationship becomes so dominant that it becomes a greater element of influence on an auditor's thinking than his commitment to professionalism.'' 'Independence a Sham Issue' **********Some accountants argue that change is long overdue. ''The whole concept is so silly,'' said Richard A. Eisner, a founding partner of the New York-based firm bearing his name. He cited an example: ''If I own $100 of my client's stock, I'm not considered independent. But I could be collecting a $100,000 fee from the same client. It makes the whole idea of independence a sham issue.'' **********Virtually unknown outside accounting, the independence rules even startle insiders who underestimated the sacrifices involved in a career in public accounting. ''They talk about it on a theoretical level in school, and then you get into real life, and you discover these problems,'' said Bill Lenhart, a senior manager at BDO Seidman, a midsized accounting firm in New York. **********He said his awakening to the ramifications of the rules came when he wanted to hire one of his firm's clients as lead singer of the nightclub rock band for which he plays drums. The hiring required BDO's approval, which was granted so long as his band loses money. In this way, it would be clear that he is not engaged in an outside money-making venture with an audit client, a situation that would be barred under the independence rules. A Kind of Reverse Nepotism **********Other endings are not so happy. The rules have deprived more than one rising star of a well-deserved promotion - a kind of reverse nepotism. And they have forced employees of firms that land new audit clients to liquidate stock holdings, sometimes at large losses. **********The independence issue also figured prominently in the latest wave of mergers and attempted mergers in the profession. Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen abandoned their dreams of forming the world's largest accounting firm recently, partly because the firms foresaw widespread independence problems. **********Andersen's consulting arm routinely enters lucrative joint ventures or subcontracting agreements with computer companies, many of which are longtime audit clients of Price Waterhouse. In a merger, the joint firm would have to forfeit the audit or consulting work to satisfy S.E.C. rules. More Delicate Problems **********Firms going ahead with mergers will also have to iron out more delicate problems. The Midwest Financial Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis, for instance, recently sued its auditor, Touche Ross, over the quality of an audit and moved its business to Deloitte, Haskins & Sells. But when Deloitte and Touche agreed to merge, a problem arose because an accountant is generally prohibited from working for an audit client on the opposite side of a lawsuit, since the audit's quality is presumed to suffer. No announcement has yet been made, but Deloitte is believed to have resigned the Midwest Financial account. **********Earlier this month, Deloitte lost another Minneapolis audit client, the Inter-Regional Financial Group Inc., under similar circumstances involving an outstanding lawsuit in which Inter-Regional, an investment broker, charged its former auditors at Touche with accounting malpractice. **********Dual-career couples also pose a real problem, said Shaun F. O'Malley, chairman of Price Waterhouse. ''When you are both starting out and one spouse is a junior accountant and the other is a junior executive at some company, no one cares. Fifteen years later, when one is a partner and the other is a chief financial officer, it's a big problem.'' Burden for Individuals, Not Firms **********And when such problems arise, it is usually the individuals, not the firms, who must make the adjustment. The S.E.C. sometimes makes an exception when two family members live at least 500 miles apart, a compromise that poses its own hardship if the parties are married. **********But the firms' biggest frustration comes from lost business. The top firms are battling to become service giants that can do consulting or litigation as easily as taxes or accounting. But the bigger and more diversified they get, the more they bump into the independence rules. **********Last year, for instance, the Energy Department was looking for someone to audit the books of several operators of uranium enrichment plants. Andersen wanted the job, but did not feel comfortable bidding unless it could bring in an industry specialist that happened to be owned by an Andersen audit client. **********To be eligible for the job under Energy Department rules, Andersen would have had to hire its own specialists as subcontractors. But subcontracting with an audit client would have violated the S.E.C.'s independence rules, and Andersen bowed out, clearing the way for KPMG Peat Marwick, another top-ranked firm, to land the contracts. Self-Regulating Procedures **********Some cases are less cut-and-dried, and the accounting firms bear much of the responsibility for interpreting the rules. Firms typically name an in-house specialist who ferrets out and resolves possible breaches of independence. At Andersen, for instance, a six-person team catalogues the firm's current and prospective clients and compares the lists against information on financial holdings and family ties submitted periodically by the firm's employees. **********Only if the in-house specialists are unsure of themselves do they seek the S.E.C.'s advice. **********Sol Schwartz & Associates, an accounting firm in San Antonio, for instance, recently asked whether it could become the auditor for a prospective client whose president and majority owner is ''the son of an individual who married the firm's managing partner's widowed mother-in-law.'' The S.E.C., generally fearful that nepotism could compromise an audit, said sorry. Soft-Hearted Decision **********But a reading of the letters on file with the S.E.C. in Washington reveals a few cases in which the S.E.C. might be viewed as soft-hearted. **********Consider Brady Martz & Associates, a Grand Forks, N.D., accounting firm that wanted to rent two floors in a four-story building owned by one of its audit clients, the First National Bank in Grand Forks. Landlord-tenant relationships raise independence problems, and the S.E.C. first denied the deal on the grounds that the accountants would be occupying a ''material'' amount of the available floor space. **********The petitioners then urged the S.E.C. to consider the six-story building across the street, also owned by First National, as part of the same complex, since the structures shared an overhead walkway and had the same decor. Thus, they argued, the accountants would be occupying a mere 15 percent of the total floor space. The S.E.C. relented."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/business/tax-refunds-delayed-a-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Refunds Delayed a Week", "print_headline": "Tax Refunds Delayed a Week", "body_text": " **********About 450,000 tax-refund checks will be delayed a week because of a computer programming error, the Internal Revenue Service said today. **********The agency said the error had been corrected and added that the problem was not nearly as severe as the one in 1985, when millions of checks were delayed. **********''People are going to get their refund checks in the four-to-six-week time frame that is typical at this time of year,'' said Ellen Murphy, the I.R.S. director of public affairs.

Instead, the company's board, usually with outside directors in a majority, has insured management's independence, even on strategic issues. Who Will Be on the Board **********At UAL, there had been no indication that the situation would be any different when the board accepted a $6.75 billion buyout proposal from the airline's pilots and top executives last week. At the time, it was made clear only that the board would include eight independent directors, three directors appointed by participating unions, three appointed by management and one appointed by British Airways P.L.C., which is putting up $750 million in equity. The division of power on the board, though, was left unclear. **********But in an interview yesterday, the pilots' leader, Frederick C. Dubinsky, said that a simple majority of the 15-member board would not be sufficient to approve big changes in the company's direction, like diversifying into areas outside the airline business or disposing of sizable assets, like its Pacific routes. **********Instead, such changes would have to be approved both by a majority of the eight independent directors on the new board and by at least two of the three labor directors. **********If the two groups of directors arrived at different decisions, shareholders would get the final say. Since the employees and workers from participating unions would own 75 percent of the shares, with management owning 10 percent and British Airways 15 percent, the employees, particularly the pilots, would thus have the largest voice on such issues. **********''It is a major turning point in the labor-management relationship,'' Mr. Dubinsky said, in the first detailed discussion of the distribution of power in what will be the nation's largest employee-owned company. ''The labor directors will have more than just their voice. It will be disproportionate to the other directors.'' **********Louis O. Kelso, an investment banker who is a pioneer of employee stock ownership plans, said yesterday that giving labor what is, in effect, veto power over company decisions was unusual in employee-held companies. **********He added, however, that the power was likely to be used mainly as an insurance policy to make sure management sticks to the core business of running an airline. He said he foresaw little danger that it would lead to conflict with management. 'In Its Own Best Interest' **********''You have to assume that labor will act in its own best interest and that they would seek the best advice they can get,'' he said. ''People tend to take care of their property. That's what private property is all about.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Dubinsky, the chairman of the Master Executive Council of United Airlines, emphasized that the eight independent directors would hold the balance of power in the day-to-day running of the company and in decisions that do not involve broad changes in the company's direction or structure. A majority of the board will prevail on such decisions. **********Under this structure, the independent directors would oversee management, which would include Stephen M. Wolf, the current chairman and chief executive, and Jack Pope, the senior financial officer. **********''I don't think we have the expertise to run the company,'' Mr. Dubinsky said, referring to the 68,000 employees and three main unions. **********''There will always be a conflict of how much money should go out in wages and working conditions and how much should go toward capitalizing the business,'' he acknowledged. ''We want a board that can walk the tightrope and keep those interests in balance.'' Flight Attendants May Join **********So far the pilots' union is the only one participating in the buyout. The flight attendants are bargaining with the company and may join, while the machinists, who have been opposed, are also expected to open talks with management. If all three join, each will appoint a director, who would be expected to be the leader of each union. **********Mr. Dubinsky said that as chairman of the union council he would hold one board seat. If the other unions do not join in, the council will appoint the other two members to represent labor, he said. **********These two directors would be drawn from outside the ranks of the pilots' union, but would be picked to represent the interests of the unions, he said. **********The eight independent directors, Mr. Dubinsky said, would be picked by Mr. Wolf in consultation with the union council. The eight, he said, might be chief executives of large companies, deans of top business schools or former senior Government officials. **********Mr. Dubinsky said the reason he and the pilots wanted the union directors to have a substantial voice in the company's future direction was the legacy of the era of Richard J. Ferris, the former chairman of UAL. Adding Hertz and Hilton **********Mr. Ferris spent the better part of a decade building a diversified company that bought Hertz rental cars and Hilton hotels so that a traveler could get all the main travel services under one corporate umbrella. At the same time, Mr. Ferris kept putting off making big plane orders, causing the pilots' union to worry that he was mortgaging United's future. **********The union and Mr. Ferris squared off in 1985 in a monthlong strike that crippled United's operations, left profits in tatters and embittered both sides. Mr. Dubinsky recalled that the union then began to consider the feasibility of buying the airline, hiring the investment banking firms Lazard Freres and Salomon Brothers. **********The union made a bid for the company in the spring of 1987, but management resisted. The attempt, however, did lead to a stockholder revolt and the ouster of Mr. Ferris in June 1987. Under pressure from stockholders, the board eventually sold Hertz and the hotel divisions and distributed the proceeds to stockholders. It also eventually brought in Mr. Wolf to run the company, by then back to being just an airline. **********The name of the company, which had been changed to the Allegis Corporation by Mr. Ferris, was changed back to UAL, with United Airlines the only major subsidiary. Only Way to Secure Future **********The experience with Mr. Ferris, Mr. Dubinsky said, convinced the leaders of the pilots that just being a strong union and waging an effective strike was not enough - to insure their future they had to win control of their airline. **********''The strike is a short-term weapon, a one-shot deal,'' he said. Even though the 6,100-pilot union had waged an effective strike, it had been unable to deflect Mr. Ferris from his path of diversifying and from pushing concessions on the union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/business/business-technology-a-vessel-to-skim-and-recycle-oil-spills.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Vessel to Skim and Recycle Oil Spills", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; A Vessel to Skim and Recycle Oil Spills", "body_text": " **********rrA huge vessel now on the drawing board could someday serve as what its designers call an environmental battleship, attacking oil spills like the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. **********The vessel, named the Seaclean and using off-the-shelf technology, resembles an oil platform and incorporates everything from oil skimmers to cleansers and an incinerator to skim, process and recycle wastes on the spot. **********Its designers, who acknowledge they are still negotiating to lease or buy the equipment and patents needed to assemble the $35 million vessel, will present their plan tomorrow in Washington to members of Congress and representatives of the oil industry in an effort to gain support. **********The Seaclean's project director, Perry Lopez of Schellstede Ltd.

Drive past its mammoth corporate headquarters a few miles south of downtown, and you spy the people filing in, day after day, to board the bus tour, thread through the brewery and meander around the stable to gawk at the famous Clydesdales. Many of the faithful then pay further obeisance by snapping up souvenir shirts and mugs at the tour center and then - why not? - by quaffing samples of the brews. **********But the Anheuser-Busch Companies has been rankled that some of the beer-guzzling public has been showing disrespect for its regal position. Word in the marketplace was that sharp and pervasive discounting by Coors and Miller have prompted some Budweiser drinkers to defect. **********For a company that holds roughly 42 percent of the country's beer market - Budweiser, its flagship brand, alone has 27 percent, bigger by itself than any of Anheuser's competitors - that just would not do. After all, as big as it is, Anheuser expects to get much bigger, having set its sights on attaining a commanding 50 percent of the market by the mid-1990's. **********Consequently, starting in October, Anheuser, at the behest of August A. Busch 3d, its intense, steely chief executive, has acted to solidify its grip on the market. Anheuser announced it would lower prices on all brands to match the national discounts of its rivals. Besides Budweiser, its brands include Michelob, Busch, Bud Light, Michelob Light and Michelob Dry. In some areas, Anheuser said, its rivals have been selling cases during promotional periods for as much as 25 percent below Anheuser's prices. Anheuser's response, it acknowledged, would hurt its earnings for the rest of this year and next, but it expected the move to keep shoving its market share up. **********''So price as a tool for our competition is no longer there anymore,'' said Mr. Busch one day recently in his office here. ''It is no longer effective.'' **********Anheuser is hoping competitors will recognize that price cutting is futile and relent. Mr. Busch said he has already spotted some higher pricing in several Texas markets. His expectation is that other markets will follow, until bargains begin to evaporate by the end of next summer. **********For its part, the Miller Brewing Company, Anheuser's closest competitor, says it is puzzled. It maintains that Anheuser has always priced its brands similar to Miller's. ''I was kind of surprised by their announcement,'' said Thomas Koehler, Miller's vice president of sales. ''It's nonsense. They made it seem like this was new and exciting, when this has been going on for years. I think they've just got some problems with the Bud brand.'' Anheuser retorts that Miller doesn't know what it's talking about. **********In almost every sense, beer has become a problematic way to make a living. People, of course, aren't swigging cans the way they used to in this new age of alcoholic moderation. The market is about as flat as a two-day-old glass of beer and with not inconsiderable forces militating against it.  Pressure on Advertising **********Anti-drinking groups have had a powerful influence in curtailing consumption of all alcoholic drinks, and while spirits and wine have been maimed more than beer, it too has been bleeding. Among other things, pressure has been intensifying to restrain beer advertising on television. **********But then again there are 80 million beer lovers in the country. No one doubts that there will always be plenty of beer sold, and analysts say that Anheuser, with revenues of nearly $10 billion, is probably always going to sell far more than anyone else. **********Miller, owned by the Philip Morris Companies, is a distant second, with a 21.8 percent share of the beer market. Analysts are fond of characterizing it as a poor Pepsi to Anheuser's Coke. **********Coming on strong is the feisty Adolph Coors Company, which has been especially forward in discounting and which recently agreed to buy the Stroh Brewery Company. The proposed deal has hit some snags, but if it goes through Coors would have an 18.7 percent market share. **********Further consolidation seems likely, with the current leading candidate to crumble being the debt-heavy C. Heileman Brewing Company, owned by the Bond Corporation. **********Indeed, the only way to grow in such a stagnating market is to snatch someone else's business. That's what Anheuser has been doing. Beer industry analysts think it will succeed in reaching its goal of a 50 percent share by the mid-90's, in part at the expense of Miller, which may well face a tussle for second place if Coors swallows Stroh's successfully. **********Given Anheuser's strength, many analysts don't interpret its price-cutting move as a true reaction to competitor pricing. ''I think they saw that as a good excuse to implement a very calculated strategy,'' said Tom Pirko, the president of Bevmark Inc., a beverage industry consulting firm. ''They saw the middle of the beer market in disarray. When you have the enemy troops in disarray, the best thing to do is charge.'' **********Anheuser has survived a lot, and always managed to get bigger. It was founded in 1876 and was largely transformed from a small family operation to the leading beer power by the promotional skills and tenacity of August Anheuser Busch Jr., who retired in 1975 and died last September at the age of 90. **********The severest test, of course, was Prohibition. The company endured by diversifying into products like soft drinks and automobile bodies. Once Prohibition was repealed, Mr. Busch was the perfect general to lead the company. He had a knack for promotion. To applaud the end of Prohibition, Mr. Busch put together a hitch of Clydesdale horses and delivered a case of Budweiser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. **********Since then, the Clydesdales have been transformed into a highly visible marketing force for Budweiser. The big horses have become one of the best-known corporate symbols in the world. The company nowadays maintains three hitches, one based in St. Louis, another in California and a third in New Hampshire. Each hitch appears in more than 100 parades and county fairs a year, in response to requests by Anheuser's 950 wholesalers. **********Another promotional coup by Mr. Busch was buying the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team in 1953.  Teaching His Son **********Mr. Busch also made sure his son would know beer. When August Anheuser Busch 3d was born in 1937, his father said, he gave him a nip of Budweiser so it would be the first beverage he tasted. **********The younger Busch began his career with the company by cleaning electric coils in Budweiser beer vats and worked in every area of the business before becoming the boss when his father retired. Three or four days a week, in the family room of his sprawling farm outside St. Louis (he flies his own helicopter from there to work), he samples perhaps five to ten of his company's products. He passes along his notes to the brewmasters on smoothness, bitterness, aroma, lightness, drinkability. ''Beer is a dynamic product,'' he said. ''It's made exclusively from Mother Nature's products.'' **********Despite the sluggishness of the market, Anheuser believes new mouths can be drawn to beer. The industry has sorely needed a new product category to inject some dynamism. Anheuser thinks that role may be filled by dry beer. **********First produced in Japan in 1987, dry beer is less sweet than conventional beer and has fewer calories and little aftertaste. The lack of an aftertaste is the key, because a certain number of older and younger consumers, especially women, seem to favor that feature. There are now some 20 dry brands in this country, though they still account for only about 1 percent of the beer market. Anheuser arrived with Michelob Dry in 1988; it has grown enough to offset erosion in the rest of the Michelob line. More recently, the company brought out Bud Dry in selected markets. **********''I think dry beer will be a great success,'' said Mr. Pirko of Bevmark. ''It's just right for American consumers because they're weaned on soft drinks and are used to products that just disappear.'' **********Mr. Koehler of Miller, on the other hand, said, ''Right now, nothing suggests to us that dry beer is any more than a fad.'' **********One unknown is whether Bud Dry will snatch customers from Bud itself. Gerald Bowes, the chief executive of Penn Distributor, an Anheuser wholesaler in Philadelphia, said: ''I'm not interested in having Bud Dry right now. My Bud sales are too strong and I don't want to hurt them.'' **********Another category that Anheuser is trying to build is beer with little or no alcohol. Yet the company has had little success with its low-alcohol entry, LA. As Emanuel Goldman, a beverage analyst at Paine Webber, put it, ''It's on a pretty active respirator.''  No-Alcohol Beer **********More recently, Anheuser has introduced in several markets a no-alcohol beer called O'Doul's. Citing strong sales, the company said last week that it would begin nationwide distribution of O'Doul's on Jan. 8. Mr. Goldman, however, feels that ''when someone wants a carbonated non-alcohol beverage, it exists; it's called a soft drink.'' **********Perhaps the most formidable force the company faces is the assault on alcoholic beverages. In an action that some brewers fear may foment further steps, the National Collegiate Athletic Association recently cut the maximum time for beer commercials to 60 seconds an hour from 90 seconds during the broadcast of its popular basketball tournament, starting with the 1991 event. In discussions with the N.C.A.A., Anheuser also agreed to match each of its conventional plugs with spots that preach moderation. **********Anheuser spends roughly $400 million a year on media ads, more than the combined budgets of Miller and Coors, and sinks about two-thirds of it into sports programming. It is the dominant beer sponsor on ESPN, the all-sports cable network, and is a sponsor, usually as the exclusive beer advertiser, for 23 of the 26 major league baseball teams and more than 300 college sports teams. **********Mr. Busch says he has no fears that beer advertising will be curbed in any significant way. What offends him much more are people who portray beer in a sinister way. **********''There are a number of people who want to place alcohol in the category of illegal drugs,'' he said. ''They try to say beer is the same as crack, cocaine and heroin. That is so ridiculous we can't even respond to it. What they're doing is sanctifying the use of crack, cocaine and heroin. When I go home tonight at dinner, I'll have a beer. My children will look at me drinking a beer. These critics would say that my children should look at that the same as me snorting cocaine. Beer is legal, legal, legal! It pays taxes and employs people.'' The company, of course, has many ways to push its suds. It gets good mileage out of its long-time roster of spokesmen: Ed McMahon, Lou Rawls and John Forsythe. It doesn't hurt that Frank Sinatra is an Anheuser wholesaler himself. One of the company's best tools is Michael Roarty, its marketing director, a peppy, fun-loving individual who is host of the glittery national wholesalers convention held every three years. **********One blemish in the Anheuser network: some recent changes among the distributors in the New York area. Last August, Anheuser bought Port Distributing on Long Island, one of the major wholesalers in the area, and in October it terminated its franchise agreement with Harbor Distributing, also on Long Island, an action now in litigation. **********Mr. Busch said the company has been troubled by a lessening of service. ''We are not going to allow that to happen,'' he said.  'All's Not Well' **********But Richard Lipsky, the director of Empire State Beer, a distributor that buys Anheuser brands from myriad wholesalers, feels Anheuser is trying to stamp out the spirited competition among Anheuser wholesalers in the New York market - distributors frequently bring beer in from other areas to get the lowest possible price - and thereby push beer prices higher. ''All's not well in the sales force,'' Mr. Lipsky said. **********Even as Anheuser gobbles up more market share, it recognizes that in the long run the beer industry will probably never again grow in the dizzying ways that the soft-drink business still does. Thus it realizes, just as it did when the market vanished altogether during Prohibition, that it must sell some things that don't make you tipsy. **********Although beer still provides more than 90 percent of Anheuser's operating profits, the company is increasingly a sort of family entertainment business. It has certainly not been lost on management that this is not a bad image to project when you have groups lambasting you for causing people to become incapable of driving their cars properly. **********Besides its two celebrated Busch Gardens, Anheuser owns a Sesame Place and Adventure Island theme park for children. Just weeks ago, it completed its acquisition of four Sea World and two other amusement parks from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., raising the number of people it will entertain from 5 million each year to 20 million.  Taking a Pulse **********''This is a direct-to-the-consumer business,'' Mr. Busch said. ''We get a feel for what the consumer thinks. We get a pulse on that. So we like the entertainment business.'' **********He went on, ''When one of those 20 million people come through one of these theme parks, we think he will leave with his image of this company enhanced. Our beer products and snack products and bread products will be enhanced.'' **********The company has had no better than fitful success in other diversifications. In 1982, it bought Campbell-Taggart, the second-largest bread maker after Continental Baking. Anheuser had some difficulties with it in the first few years but has managed to straighten things out. Its Eagle Snacks subsidiary, however, has been losing money since it was begun in 1982. Another disappointing diversification, Exploration Cruise Lines, was sold last year. **********It is unclear just what else Anheuser will try, other than that it is dubious that it will experiment again with other beverages. It has burned its fingers a number of times with small forays into soft drinks, like Root 66 root beer. It bombed with Chelsea, a low-alcohol lemon-lime-ginger-apple beverage. It fizzled in its adventures into the sparkling water market and into wine coolers.

Little did he know that this would also keep away Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********An unwelcome tempest that drenched this Mediterranean isle tonight forced cancellation of their shipboard dinner. The President remained on the cruiser Belknap, a hostage to foul seas. **********Instead of charting a new course for Europe with the Soviet leader at sundown, Mr. Bush was standing on the bridge helplessly bobbing up and down amid 16-foot waves and 60-mile-an-hour winds. The two Presidents did meet on schedule in the morning, on the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky, moored to a dock, rather than on the Soviet cruiser Slava, rolling out in the harbor. But the President's second session with Mr. Gorbachev and the dinner scheduled first for the Belknap and then for the more stabilized Gorky had to be canceled. Schedule Is Abandoned **********''The President has no schedule,'' a White House press aide, Sean Walsh, told the hundreds of astonished journalists on shore. They composed headlines like ''Choppy Seas Delay End of Cold War.'' **********On the Maxim Gorky, Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, made her own announcement of the no-show by Mr. Bush. ''Presidenta nyet,'' she said. **********It was a naval farce worthy of Gilbert and Sullivan. Mr. Gorbachev was only 1,000 yards away on the Gorky, snugly tied to the dock in Marsaxlokk Bay. But he might as well have been in Vladivostok for all the good it was doing for superpower summitry. **********After changing ship sites for this morning's meeting from the Slava to the more stable Gorky, the two leaders were able to meet for five hours. **********They swiftly started on a matter of substance: the weather. But they could not reach an agreement. **********Mr. Bush kept insisting that the seas were calming. Mr. Gorbachev slyly suggested that the worsening storm had inspired a Soviet arms proposal. **********''The first thing to do is to eliminate those types of ships which you cannot board in this kind of weather,'' the Soviet leader said. Smiling mischievously, he added, ''We will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the Sixth Fleet.'' **********President Bush did not come up with a Reaganesque rejoinder. Disconcerted by the cameras recording the meeting and looking a bit tired from travel, he seemed to miss the joke. **********''Calming down,'' he said again, referring to the seas. ''It's a good sign.''  A Faulty Prediction **********Before he left Washington, the President had predicted that things would go smoothly this weekend. ''We have some nice anchorage there,'' he said, adding humorously, ''Nobody is going to be throwing up.'' **********But the salt-water summit conference quickly got a bad case of mal de mer. **********Winds hurled people to the ground and turned microwave dishes into flying saucers. Cable News Network lost its ability to go on the air for several hours when the wind tipped over its transmission dishes, but network employees here managed to patch things back together in time for their first live feed of the day. **********Breakers sent spray 50 feet into the air and washed across the roads. Tugboats desperately tried to keep the Slava and Belknap from smashing into the docks or each other. **********The television networks' seaside anchor booths were demolished, and a $50,000 A.T.& T. underwater cable laid to provide ship-to-shore White House communication snapped when the Belknap pulled from its stern anchor. **********''It's usually beautiful here - it's all Bush and Gorbachev's fault,'' said a peeved Maltese official, well aware that the pictures showing a scene more like the Carolinas during Hurricane Hugo than a sun-dappled getaway isle would not help Maltese tourism. **********But through it all, until the storm sank his summit schedule, President Bush was having a ball. **********Even when it took three passes for the small cabin cruiser carrying the President to deliver Mr. Bush safely to the Belknap's gangway after his morning session, the President seemed unfazed. He smiled into the wind as his trench coat flapped behind him. **********If there is one thing the President, a speedboat fanatic and former Navy lieutenant, junior grade, enjoys more than a boat ride, it is a bumpy boat ride, one on which the other passengers begin to look a little green. **********Some world leaders, like President Francois Mitterrand of France, refuse to get in a boat with him, pleading a susceptibility to seasickness. **********''The President likes this sort of thing - the soup,'' said Sig Rogich, the President's director of events and activities. ''He probably wishes he had his speedboat here.'' **********Another White House official here agreed: ''The President loves this stuff; he loves charging around the waves. He believes that sailors belong on ships and ships belong at sea.''  Storm Humor **********In line with Mr. Bush's macho approach to the sea, White House officials issued increasingly salty bulletins from their quarantine on the Belknap. **********In the first statement, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, who was also stranded on the Belknap, said the President ''enjoyed the sea experience'' as he was bounced about on the cabin cruiser, known as the admiral's barge. Mr. Fitzwater offhandedly described the scene, saying Mr. Bush ''rolled somewhat through the high seas.'' **********An hour later, with the tempest worsening, Mr. Fitzwater sent another message by phone, talking about how the President had been watching the storm from the bridge and keeping in constant contact with officials in Washington to stay abreast of the situation in the Philippines. **********The imprisoned press secretary threw down a swaggering dare to reporters: ''I am offering an exclusive Presidential interview to any reporter who can get to the Belknap in the next 15 minutes. Any reporter who swims will be granted three interviews.'' **********In his final missive from sea, canceling tonight's dinner, he said that ''the 60-miles-per-hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail.''  Easier Heard Than Said **********Ronald Reagan used to drive Mikhail Gorbachev crazy when he tried to speak Russian. **********Over and over, whenever they met, Mr. Reagan would awkwardly say, ''Doveryai no proveryai,'' the Russian maxim ''Trust but verify.'' **********When Mr. Reagan used the line on Mr. Gorbachev during the Washington summit conference in 1987, the exasperated Soviet leader replied, ''You always say that.'' **********Now, to the Soviet leader's dismay, Mr. Bush has become a summit linguist. **********During a photo session at the start of their meeting in the card room on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck, under a picture of Gorky smoking a pipe, Mr. Gorbachev was asked what kind of achievements he hoped for at the summit meeting. **********''Mnogovo,'' he replied, using the Russian word for many, which is pronounced MNAW-guh-vuh. **********When President Bush was asked the same question, he also replied ''Mnogovo.'' But it came out sounding more like ''Managua,'' a subject that might have been on the President's mind since he said he intended to chastise the Soviet leader about Soviet involvement in arms shipments to the Nicaraguan Government.  To Brief or Not to Brief **********Mr. Bush's top advisers, James A. Baker 3d, Brent Scowcroft, John H. Sununu and Marlin Fitzwater, were all quarantined on the Belknap with the President. **********When Mr. Fitzwater could not get to shore to give the joint briefing he had planned with a Soviet spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, some summit one-upsmanship occurred. **********Mr. Gerasimov indicated that he might go it alone, which worried the American officials. **********The two sides argued for an hour; elaborate negotiations finally led to this solution: Roman Popadiuk, the deputy press secretary, joined one of Mr. Gerasimov's deputies in the briefing room at the Mediterranean Conference Center to say that no one would brief the reporters. They talked about how well the Americans and Russians were cooperating. **********As soon as the Soviets left, the Americans gave a briefing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/13/business/bush-chooses-head-for-ftc.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Chooses Head for F.T.C.", "print_headline": "Bush Chooses Head for F.T.C.", "body_text": " **********President Bush announced Thursday that he had selected Janet Dempsey Steiger, a longtime personal friend, to be chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. **********She will be nominated to succeed Daniel Oliver, the current chairman.

So, Lin Broadcasting Inc. said yesterday that it would split into two independent companies so it could concentrate on its cellular phone business. **********Lin's seven television stations will be spun off as a separate company, with the shares to be distributed to the current Lin stockholders on a one-for-one basis. The remaining company, to be renamed, will retain the cellular telephone operations in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Philadelphia. It will also own a publishing business. Lin Broadcasting is based in New York. **********Wall Street liked the move. Lin Broadcasting's stock jumped $4.75 a share yesterday, to close at $101 in over-the-counter trading. **********''It is a good move for the shareholders of Lin,'' said Fred Seegal, an investment banker with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''It makes it easier for everyone to recognize the underlying values.'' Broader Base of Potential Buyers **********If one of Lin's motives is to deter unwanted suitors, the move could backfire. ''It has broadened the base of potential buyers because buyers who like the telephone companies don't have the television stations to contend with,'' another analyst said. **********The tax implications of the spinoff were not clear yesterday. But analysts said the split could make the cellular company more attractive because a buyer would not have to pay for the television stations and then pay a capital-gains tax if they were resold after the acquisition. **********They also noted that the spinoff might protect the position of the company's chairman, Donald A. Pels. Even if the cellular telephone company attracts a takeover offer, Mr. Pels, whose background is in broadcasting, stands to continue as chief executive of the television company, which is less likely to attract a bidder. **********The use of cellular telephones has been growing rapidly, especially in the markets where Lin operates. Although Lin is a relatively modest company, with 1988 earnings of $82.1 million on revenues of $225.5 million, its market value at yesterday's stock price was more than $5 billion. **********Lin's cellular franchises serve markets of about 18 million people, although some of the franchises are in partnership with other companies. Analysts said this kind of coverage, known as ''pops'' in industry jargon, would have a minimum market value of more than $3.6 billion. **********The future of the cellular properties is not entirely clear because the Federal tax laws are themselves somewhat unclear, several experts pointed out. If a buyer moved to acquire the cellular businesses after Lin is split, the bid could possibly create a retroactive tax liability on the television station spinoff because the Internal Revenue Service could view the spinoff as an attempt to avoid taxes, the experts said. **********For the television spinoff to qualify for tax-free treatment, the remaining company has to have been in business for five years. Lin's cellular operations have only been around for three years. The cellular company, however, will also own Guest Informant, Lin's publishing operation that produces the advertiser-supported city guide books. Interest From McCaw **********Lin Broadcasting has already attracted the attention of a potential takeover bidder. McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the nation's largest operator of cellular telephone systems, owns 9.8 percent of Lin's stock and has received Government permission to increase the stake to 14.9 percent. **********Mr. Pels, the company's chairman, owns less than 1 percent of Lin's stock. **********Meanwhile, British Telecom P.L.C. has arranged to buy 22 percent of McCaw for $1.2 billion. When that deal is completed and McCaw has the financing in hand, industry executives expect it to increase its stake in Lin and possibly bid for control. **********When McCaw acquired a controlling interest in a cellular franchise in Santa Barbara, Calif., earlier this year, industry executives said the price came to $275 per person, which was reportedly the highest price per person ever paid for a cellular system. **********The television stations have become secondary to the cellular operations at Lin, although they are what Mr. Pels first focused on when he left Capital Cities Communications Inc. to take control of the company in 1969. The seven stations are worth at least $900 million, analysts said. **********In the 1980's, Mr. Pels began to invest aggressively in cellular franchises, some in partnerships with Metromedia Inc.

Every night there are scenes of horror stories that inspire pity for the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and hatred for ''the small number of conspirators'' who began ''a counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' **********In the first days after the military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators on June 4, in which soldiers killed hundreds or perhaps thousands of civilians in central Beijing, the television showed Government footage of civilians throwing rocks and stones at tanks and soldiers. **********The Government has now moved beyond that, using other scenes to nurture a sense of outrage against the ''thugs'' and ''hooligans'' who are accused of inflicting damage to the city. **********Tonight's national television news program was fairly typical. Here is some of what the viewers saw.  Scene 1 **********The camera pans to a large, sparsely furnished hall where several hundred high officials have come to listen to a reading of a speech first delivered by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader. The speech is introduced by Prime Minister Li Peng, who appears wearing a Western-style suit for the first time in recent days. **********''Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech made a profound analysis of the cause and nature of the counterrevolutionary rebellion and the correctness of the measures we adopted,'' Prime Minister Li tells the gathering. **********Mr. Li's voice fades out and the announcer explains that Mr. Li had urged everyone at the meeting to study Mr. Deng's words carefully and to ''unify the people's thinking on the basis of Deng Xiaoping's speech.'' **********The camera passes through the rows of officials sitting in folding chairs as the announcer lists the names of some of the more important officials. Some officials are taking notes, some are reading and at least one participant is looking sleepy.  Scene 2 **********The camera opens on a street corner, called Xidan, where a great deal of the violence took place in the early-morning hours of June 4. Xidan was also where a soldier was killed and his body disemboweled and burned by civilians. For the last few nights, the television news has shown scenes of the charred body of the soldier propped against a truck, or lying flat on its back. **********A few days ago, the television news showed citizens placing small wreaths along the bridge at the intersection, in memory of the soldier. Now, the camera shows how the railings are brimming with large, colorful wreaths as parades of citizens continue to lay more flowers in the soldier's honor. **********The announcer relates the Government version of the events of that June 4 morning, when the soldier, Liu Guogeng, was killed, supposedly while trying to rescue a man from a boisterous crowd. **********The soldier was on his way to seek help from colleagues, the announcer says, but when he was about 200 yards away from the Communist Party headquarters, on the Avenue of Eternal Peace, or Changan Avenue, he was beaten to death by ''thugs'' who then doused his body in petroleum, disemboweled it and then burned it. **********The picture then switches to Jilin Province, where Mr. Liu's mother, father and younger brother live. **********''I ask his younger brother to learn from the older brother,'' says his mother, who is sobbing with sorrow and anger. ''Go annihilate the thugs.'' **********His father, lying sick in a hospital bed with an undisclosed ailment, says: ''We must resolutely deal with these thugs. They deserve no leniency.'' **********His younger brother says: ''I feel honored. I will learn from my brother.''  Scene 3 **********An announcer reports that as of Tuesday, the Beijing Public Security Bureau has received 1,227 letters giving details about ''counterrevolutionary thugs.''  Scene 4 **********The camera turns to a meeting of 31 leaders of China's ethnic minorities, including a Tibetan Buddhist, who are all voicing their support for the Government's efforts to ''put down the recent rebellion.'' **********The announcer reads a few remarks by one of the leaders. ''The scheme of those who wanted to create contradictions and stir up riots among the ethnic groups have failed thanks to the joint efforts of the minority people,'' the announcer quotes the leader as saying.  Scene 5 **********Two students who were named on Tuesday among the list of 21 ''wanted'' student leaders are seen being led into a police station for interrogation. **********One of them is Zhou Fengsuo, a 22-year-old physics student at Qinghua University in Beijing, who was arrested in the central city of Xian, where his family lives. He was reportedly turned in by his older sister and brother-in-law. **********The scene turns to a livingroom couch in Xian, where Mr. Zhou's sister, Zhou Yanrong, is sitting with a baby in her lap and her husband next to her. **********Miss Zhou and her husband, Yang Yibo, who works at the Institute of Communications Engineering in Xian, says she saw the Tuesday television news that showed the woman's younger brother as a fugitive. **********The couple say they discussed what to do next and came to what the television announcer thought was the correct conclusion. **********''They contacted the security office of the institute, and the officers there cooperated with five policeman to go to the town of Three Bridges to arrest Zhou Fengsuo,'' the announcer says. **********''Zhou Fengsuo confessed that he was a member of the standing committee of the Beijing autonomous student union and that on June 9, he took the train to Xian,'' the announcer adds.  Scene 6 **********The camera focuses on an old, heavy-set woman, standing in the Chongwenmen district on a bridge covered with wreaths to commemorate a soldier. The soldier was reportedly beaten up by ''thugs'' on the evening of June 3. **********The old woman says she witnessed the ''thugs'' kill the soldier by throwing him off the bridge. **********''I stand in front of the people of this city as a witness,'' the woman says, speaking into a television microphone. ''The People's Liberation Army soldiers did not shoot people.'' **********''I went up to the People's Liberation Army soldiers with some other old women and we pleaded with them not to shoot the people,'' the woman says. ''They told us: 'We are the people's army. We will not shoot the people.' '' **********''But then the thugs spread a rumor, telling the people that the soldiers had killed the son of an old woman,'' she says. The woman explains how the ''thugs'' then beat up the soldier and threw him off the bridge. **********''When I saw the dead soldier, I felt terrible,'' she says. ''He was still alive when he was thrown off the bridge. I feel I should bear some responsibility for the death of the soldier because I took the lead with two other women to go after the soldier, and this gave the thugs the opportunity to follow us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/24/world/cuba-discloses-a-drug-network-of-top-officials.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cuba Discloses A Drug Network Of Top Officials", "print_headline": "Cuba Discloses A Drug Network Of Top Officials", "body_text": " **********Cuba has gone to great lengths in the last few days to acknowledge that some of President Fidel Castro's closest aides were involved in smuggling drugs to the United States. **********For years, Cuba has denied involvement in drug smuggling. The reversal has astonished American officials and other specialists on Cuba. They are speculating that the stream of allegations, disclosures and admissions may reflect a political power struggle in Cuba or an effort by Mr. Castro to explore areas of potential cooperation with the United States. **********Some experts on Cuba say Mr. Castro is trying to dissociate himself from the drug smuggling by condemning it. The United States says he has known of such traffic for years.  Unveiling Medellin Connection **********Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Castro had admitted Cuba's role as a transit point for cocaine smugglers after being ''confronted by overwhelming evidence.'' **********Cuban officials charged on Thursday that senior military officers had helped the Medellin drug cartel of Colombia smuggle six tons of cocaine and some marijuana into the United States over the last two and a half years. **********The American officials said they could not immediately provide information about possible connections between Cuban traffickers and people in the United States. **********Official Cuban newspaper reports and radio broadcasts give extraordinary detail about the drug-smuggling activities, including the time, place and content of conversations among Cubans, Colombians and Panamanians. The information is generally compatible with data collected by United States law-enforcement and intelligence agencies, Administration officials said. From Denial to Disclosure?  Such allegations are startling because Cuban officials in the past repeatedly denied any official or unofficial Cuban involvement in narcotics trafficking. In a 1985 interview, Mr. Castro said that ''Cuba has an unimpeachable record'' on drugs. He said then that he did not know of any case in which a Cuban official had been involved in the drug business. **********On June 14, Cuba announced the arrest of one of its most highly respected generals, Arnaldo T. Ochoa Sanchez, who had commanded Cuban troops in Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua. Two days later Cuba announced the arrest of six more miliatry officers including Brig. Gen. Patricio de la Guardia Font and his twin brother, Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font. **********The Cuban suspects asserted that their narcotics activities were authorized by the Cuban Government and that they intended to turn over the proceeds to the Government, the official Cuban newspaper Granma reported on Thursday. **********But the newspaper said ''the cynicism of these pretexts was quickly discovered'' when the Cuban authorities discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars hidden in the suspects' briefcases and at the homes of their friends and relatives. Questions About Castro's Role **********Ernesto Betancourt, director of Radio Marti, the United States Government station that broadcasts to Cuba, said Mr. Castro was trying to deflect suspicion away from himself. ''How can Castro claim he knew nothing about drugs when he himself has been involved?'' Mr. Betancourt asked. ''Nobody in Cuba is involved in this type of thing on his own.'' **********Mr. Castro was mentioned in the indictment of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian leader, returned by a Federal grand jury in Miami in February 1988. The indictment said that Mr. Castro met with General Noriega in Havana ''on or about June 29, 1984,'' in an effort to mediate a dispute between the Panamanian leader and members of the Medellin cartel. The dispute involved the cartel's cocaine operations in Panama. **********In 1982, the chief of the Cuban Navy and three other high-ranking Cuban officials were indicted in Miami on Federal drug-smuggling charges. Last year in a separate case, a Federal grand jury charged that cocaine was flown from Colombia to Cuba, where it was unloaded and transferred onto boats for shipment to the United States. Two men recently pleaded guilty to a 27-count indictment in that case. Skeptical Americans **********Jacqueline Tillman, who followed Cuba for the National Security Council from 1984 to 1988, said today, ''The evidence of Cuban involvement in narcotics trafficking was becoming so abundant that the regime moved to protect Fidel Castro by dissociating him from those activities.'' **********Frank Calzon, a Cuban-born political scientist who serves as the Washington representative of Freedom House, a human rights organization, said that Fidel Castro or his brother, Raul Castro, the Defense Minister, ''had to approve of this activity, or at least looked the other way.'' **********American officials said they wanted to see a change in Cuban behavior before they gave Mr. Castro credit for taking a tough stance against drug trafficking. An aide to William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said officials at that agency were taking ''a wait-and-see attitude.'' **********Granma said on Thursday that an aide to General Ochoa, Capt. Jorge Martinez Valdez, met ''the all-powerful chief'' of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, in Colombia in May 1988. ''An understanding was rapidly reached between Martinez and Escobar for trafficking cocaine through Cuba,'' Granma said. ''This cooperation was to be paid at the rate of $1,200 per kilogram.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/world/upheaval-in-the-east-soviet-group-drops-call-for-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 410, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Group Drops Call for Strike", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; Soviet Group Drops Call for Strike", "body_text": " **********Members of a liberal group in the Soviet Parliament reportedly agreed today to drop a call for a nationwide strike over the right to debate the Communist Party's monopoly on political power. **********Instead, a meeting of just under half the 400-member Inter-Regional Group adopted a compromise resolution allowing each member to take independent political action. **********''The Inter-Regional Group called on all voters to adopt resolutions at rallies and meetings and to send letters and telegrams and find other ways to support the demand,'' the official press agency Tass reported. **********The strike had been called for Monday by leaders of the group, including the physicist Andrei D.

Supercomputers specialize in performing mathematically intensive processing operations to solve very complex problems rapidly. **********But both users and producers are finding that the supercomputer technology called parallel processing, in which tasks are broken up and distributed among multiple computer processors, accelerates some business software as well as it does scientific programs. Parallel processing overcomes the speed limits of individual processors; theoretically, four processors handle a problem almost four times as fast as one. 'Scared a Lot of People' **********''It's just become reasonable recently for people to develop data base software on parallel processors,'' said David DeWitt, a professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin. ''Before, you had to go out and start your own hardware company as Teradata did, and that scared a lot of people off.'' **********Mr. DeWitt noted that Tandem Computers Inc., a pioneer in the use of multiple processors, has rewritten portions of its Non-Stop SQL data base software to run in parallel, and that the International Business Machines Corporation is taking a similar approach to its mainframe data base product, DB-2. **********Some simple parallel systems have been used in business since the early 1980's, but the announcement last week by the Oracle Corporation that it would write a version of its leading data base software for a machine with more than 8,000 processors was a kind of watershed for the technology. Oracle's relational data base program, which can find sets of related records simultaneously, is used by thousands of companies in a range of industries. **********''A number of large Oracle customers are extremely interested in the commercial use of supercomputers,'' said Peter Tierney, Oracle's vice president for marketing, explaining why Oracle will produce software for supercomputers made by Ncube, which is based in Beaverton, Ore. **********Mr. Tierney said that the first customers would probably be in the petroleum and military industries, which are already big supercomputer users, but that there was also interest from financial service, transportation and hospitality companies. **********Jeffrey Canin, an independent supercomputer analyst in San Francisco, said: ''Parallel processing is not a controversial issue anymore. Companies with the credibility of Oracle blessing this architecture will make it safe for other kinds of applications.'' **********There is ample precedent for supercomputers moving into the commercial arena. Nearly every new computer architecture has first been adopted by the scientific community, which is more willing to take risks to gain performance, and then by business. Perhaps the best example is the Digital Equipment Corporation's Vax minicomputer, which started as an engineer's tool but became a successful general-purpose computer. **********Indeed, Gordon Bell, the chief designer of the Vax and now a vice president with the Ardent Computer Corporation, said parallel processing would gradually take over commercial computing. ''It's happening in the technical areas and there's no reason it won't happen in commercial areas,'' he said. Only the conservatism of commercial users and their investment in existing software would slow the change, he said. **********But some analysts are skeptical, noting that converting software to run on a parallel system is not easy, even for scientific users. Within the broad field of parallel processing, machines run from four to eight processors to as many as 64,000 in ''massively parallel'' systems, and some may be better suited to business than others. **********''It is going to be a number of years before true parallel processing machines are really considered mainstream architecture,'' said Gary Smaby, an analyst with Needham & Company in Minneapolis. ''There are certain types of problems that can be broken up very cleanly across multiple processors, but most common programs don't lend themselves to that.'' **********Most analysts say the machines most likely to gain a foothold in the commercial market are the so-called mini-supercomputers, typically priced from $300,000 to $1 million, rather than true supercomputers like those of Cray Research Inc., which range in price from $5 million to $25 million. A Cray spokesman said that while the company's machines were sometimes used to run commercial software, they were not bought for that purpose. He added that Cray was not aiming for that market. **********One maker of parallel systems that has focused on the commercial market is Sequent Computer Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore. Sequent's machines fall below the supercomputer level, but offer faster performance than comparably priced minicomputers by linking up to 30 microprocessors of the type commonly used singly in personal computers. **********C. Scott Gibson, Sequent's president and chief operating officer, said the company's computers offer ''practical parallel.'' **********''We wanted our parallel machines to be out there living and breathing in real applications,'' he said. Sequent's customers include the Internal Revenue Service, which uses Oracle software to respond to taxpayer questions, and the Radisson Hotel Company, which coordinates reservations for 200 hotels using an Action Software program and a four-processor Sequent system. **********Parallel systems have also created new types of applications. The Teradata Corporation of Los Angeles produces a specialized data base supercomputer using up to 268 processors. Teradata's machines can be linked to the mainframes or minicomputers of other companies and are used primarily for decision support, which Richard Van Hoesen, a spokesman, defines as ''the ability to take large amounts of information and manipulate and aggregate it in such a way that it's usable.'' **********Teradata counts many large companies among its customer base, including Citibank, K Mart and A.T.&T. ''This is mainstream big business,'' Mr. Van Hoesen said. ''The reason we're in there is we're enabling them to do things they know they need to do and can't find any other way to do.'' **********Mr. Van Hoesen uses a deck of cards as an analogy for a computer data base to explain why parallel processing works so well. If one person is asked, for example, to find all the sixes in a deck, shuffling through all 52 cards would take a minute or more. Four people each shuffling through 13 cards would reduce the task to seconds, and 52 people could accomplish the task in an instant. The same is true of computer processors searching a data base. **********Thinking Machines Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., has also moved beyond scientific problems to business applications. The company recently sold two of its 64,000-processor computers, dubbed the Connection Machine, to Dow Jones & Company for a new electronic information retrieval service called Dow Quest. This service lets an unskilled user browse rapidly through a vast library of information from business newpapers and magazines. **********''What goes on behind that is a huge computation that just could not be done on a sequential machine in a reasonable amount of time,'' said Danny Hillis, Thinking Machines' chief scientist. In such applications the issue of converting existing software to run in parallel is not relevant, ''because you didn't have old software to do that,'' he said. **********''We ourselves look more toward new applications,'' he added. **********Other companies have found that the distinction between science and business applications is not black and white. Business tasks may rely on algorithms similar to engineering programs, and many scientific tasks require just as much data base management as commercial jobs do. **********''Many problems you find in business can be adapted to high-performance 'scientific' machines like ours,'' said Frank Vince, vice president for marketing at the Convex Computer Corporation in Richardson, Tex., the leading maker of mini-supercomputers. The advantage is the ''ability to do much more work in a given period,'' he said. Many business applications, like financial modeling, are actually scientific in nature, he added. **********Justin Rattner, director of technology for Intel Scientific Computers, agreed. ''Even though the problems are different in business, the math is very similar to problems we've already tackled in science,'' he said. But the value of parallel processing in business remains very application-dependent, he added. ''Parallel machines really shine when you're doing very complex queries, the kind of question that ties up an I.B.M. for hours,'' he said.  Wider Uses for the Big Machines  For the past decade supercomputers have been used almost exlusively for scientific applications. Now new types of software that exploit a supercomputer technology known as parallel processing are introducing the machines to commercial applications in a wide range of industries. Some of those applications:  Banks: Customer transactins, mortgage and loan analysis.  Brokerage firms: Trade execution, program trading, tracking os stocks and assets.  Hospitals: Patient records, insurance reporting, purchasing decisions.  Mail-order houses: Order fulfillment, customer demography.  Manufacturers: Adjusting just-in-time productin, inventory analysis, quality control.  News Services: Electronic Information Retrieval.  The Difference in Parallel Processing  Computers bases on parallel processing are making it easier to perform complicated tasks more rapidly and creating new capabilities for a wide variety of businesses. Under the old single processing system, one program is handled by one processor and tasks are processed in sequence. In a multiprocessor system, each processor handles one program. In parallel processing each program is broken into different tasks that are distributed among more than one processor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Officials said such a process could take several years and could be challenged every step of the way by disgruntled individuals or groups. **********''There are claims from as far as Moscow, Nepal and London from people who passed through Bhopal at the time of the tragedy,'' said S. Satyam, Bhopal's relief and rehabilitation commissioner, whose department is studying 345,000 other claims. Those claims have been backed up with medical documents and Mr. Satyam said that about 40,000 are ready for immediate distribution of funds. Families Could Get $14,000 **********The $470 million decree, which is worth 7.1 billion Indian rupees - the equivalent of the annual budget of a small state - has been denounced by citizens' groups, newspapers and lawyers as too small to meet the needs of the victims over several decades. **********Many residents of the Jayaprakash Nagar shantytown opposite the pesticide plant say they do not believe they will get the money, which would elevate several thousand families from poverty into the middle class. According to an official proposal, the family of each person killed by the gas will get the equivalent of $14,000; those with extensive, lifelong health damage will get the same; individuals with slight injuries will be entitled to about $3,200 and those with property losses will receive similar compensation. **********The Government said more than 3,400 people have died as a result of exposure to the gas, methyl isocyanate, which also caused psychological problems and permanent damage to lungs and eyesight. Yet no claims have been filed on behalf of 350 people who died within hours of the disaster. **********''Those who spend money will get the money,'' said Purshottam Tolani, who plies a cart selling fried potato snacks. ''Most of the claims are bogus.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/28/world/india-reports-1000-deaths-in-hindu-muslim-fighting.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1989-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 812, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India Reports 1,000 Deaths in Hindu-Muslim Fighting", "print_headline": "India Reports 1,000 Deaths in Hindu-Muslim Fighting", "body_text": " **********Weeks after this city and more than 150 villages were devastated by some of India's worst Hindu-Muslim fighting, police officials are still uncovering graves from massacres that they say have left as many as 1,000 dead. **********Others estimate that the toll could be as high as 1,500. About 400 bodies, mostly Muslims, have been found. Besides the killings, the violence drove 35,000 people, also predominantly Muslims, into refugee camps, when mobs armed with guns, spears, swords and kerosene bottles attacked and set fire to their homes. Fear and tension prevail in areas hit by violence, and Hindus and Muslims are afraid to travel to areas dominated by the other group. **********Several factors fueled the crisis, including growing Hindu-Muslim tension over a disputed shrine, Ayodhya, in the neighboring northern state of Uttar Pradesh; rumors that hundreds of Hindu students in Bhagalpur were killed by Muslims; a Muslim attack on a Hindu rally and on Hindu police and civil administrators here. Tension in the state of Bihar has intensified since last summer, and Hindu-Muslim clashes have broken out in several parts of the state over the shrine. **********In India, where lines still often blur between politics and religion, the dispute over sacred ground claimed by both Muslims and Hindus is regarded as a powder keg. For Hindus, Ayodhya is not just any sacred town; it is the birthplace of a god, Rama, the hero of the epic Ramayana. Hindu fundamentalists say that Ayodhya was taken from them in the 16th century by a Muslim king, who built a small mosque on the site. #1,500 People Arrested Senior police officials in Bhagalpur said last week that details of the killings, which took place two months ago, were emerging only now partly because of a coverup by local officials and a collapse of the local government. As a result, leading organizers of the violence have been able to evade capture. Subodh Keshav, the new district magistrate, the top civil authority at Bhagalpur, said that about 1,500 people have been arrested. **********''The tendency of the police has been to suppress things,'' said a police official. ''Information is still trickling in from all over the place; a lot of stray killings have been unaccounted for.'' **********The violence has destroyed relations between the Hindu and Muslim communities, and people say it will take years to improve. **********''There is mistrust and more than the mistrust is the utter fear,'' said Ashok Singh, an official responsible for rehabilitating 35,000 displaced people. A Coverup Is Charged **********Some of the most brutal attacks, which occurred between Oct. 24 and 28, went unreported until recently because of what Ajit Datt, a top police investigator, called a coverup by junior police and Government officials, who sided with Hindu mobs. **********The scale of the violence, independent scholars say, reflects the collapse of local order, especially the failure of the police in Bihar, India's most lawless and impoverished state, and the power of criminal gangs. Bhagalpur has a reputation for violence and brutality, including police brutality. In 1980, several policemen were arrested for blinding suspected criminals with sulfuric acid and needles. Most of them were given light sentences. **********Local officials say that the authorities focused on containing the clashes in Bhagalpur, but neglected the countryside, where the violence was reportedly even worse. The attacks drove thousands of people into the safety of hastily organized refugee centers. **********Those who have returned to their homes, like Mohammed Saleem at Logai village, 15 miles southeast of here, have found their houses burned shells of brick and wood. ''We have nothing to look forward to here,'' said Mr. Saleem, 40 years old. ''I will go away and live with relatives. There are too many memories.'' Mr. Saleem said his two wives and three children were killed at Logai and buried with over 100 others. **********Frightened Hindu witnesses led police to five graves in the rice fields flanking the village earlier this month. Last weekend, police investigators reported that a local police official had organized a coverup of the killings by instructing the organizers of the violence to remove the bodies from their houses and from a small lake where men, women and children had been hacked to death with spears, swords and axes. **********Most of the killers have fled and so has the policeman, according to officials. Only one man from the village, a member of the lower caste community known as the Gangotas, has been arrested on a murder charge and the police are hunting about 100 others."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/04/business/credit-markets-treasury-bonds-fall-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1989-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 944, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Bonds Fall Sharply", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Bonds Fall Sharply", "body_text": " **********Treasury bond prices fell by more than half a point near the close of trading yesterday after the Treasury Department dashed hopes that bonds to finance the savings industry rescue plan would come from the existing pool of long-term Treasury debt. **********The Treasury's decision raised the prospect that an additional $10 billion of 30-year Government securities will be sold in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Some participants said that an infusion of that much new paper could put upward pressure on long-term interest rates. **********The Treasury announced its intentions as it disclosed it would sell a total of $28.75 billion worth of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds at next week's quarterly refunding auctions. **********Instead of having the Resolution Funding Corporation, the proposed entity that will oversee the three-year, $50 billion bailout operation buy existing zero-coupon bonds from the market, the Treasury said it would issue new bonds directly to Refcorp. The new entity will then offer the bonds to investors. **********''The announcement changes the fundamentals of the long bond,'' said A. Craig Coats, vice chairman of Voute, Coats, Stuart & O'Grady, a Government securities trading firm. ''The net result is that we may see spreads between 10-year notes and 30-year bonds narrow.'' **********For more than a year, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds have remained in a quite narrow trading range despite a rise in inflation and an increasingly tight monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve Board, an approach that has pushed up short-term interest rates by more than three percentage points since late March, 1988. **********Analysts have cited continued strong demand for and the relatively short supply of Treasury bonds as an important reason behind the stability in long-term rates. **********The Treasury's announcement came near the end of what had been an otherwise quiet session in which bond and note prices had moved modestly higher. **********Early in the day, traders were encouraged by a report prepared by the nation's regional Federal Reserve banks that showed that economic conditions remained moderate during a six-week period ending in mid-April, and that wage and price pressures eased somewhat. A report that showed new-car sales for the last 10 days of April remained sluggish despite incentives was also a positive, traders said. **********The serene atmosphere came to an abrupt end around 4:30 P.M., however, when the announcement was made and a sharp selloff of longer-dated issues ensued. **********By late yesterday, the 8 7/8 percent Treasury bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 98 7/8, down half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.99 percent. From its midafternoon highs, the drop amounted to more than half a point. Late Tuesday the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.94 percent. Other bond issues also suffered.  The 9 percent bonds of 2018, for instance, were offered at a price of 100 5/32, down 14/32, to yield just under 9 percent. **********The prospect of an increased supply of long-term bonds had little impact on secondary issues of short- to intermediate-term Treasury notes. **********By late yesterday, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 7/8, unchanged on the day, to yield 9.06 percent. And the price of the 9 1/4 percent two-year notes was also unchanged, at a late offered rate of 99 3/ 32, to yield 9.19 percent. **********Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-Month Bill Rates **********In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 8.54 percent, up three basis points, or hundredths of a point. But six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to an offered rate of 8.47 percent. **********In its refunding announcement, the Treasury said it will sell $9.75 billion of 3-year notes on Tuesday, $9.50 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $9.5 billion of 30-year bonds on May 11 by reopening the issue of outstanding 8 7/8 percent bonds of Feb. 15, 2019. **********The Treasury said proceeds from the sales would be used to refund $17.3 billion worth of securities and to raise about $11.5 billion in new cash. **********In when-issued trading after the announcement, the 3-year notes were offered at a price to yield 9.17 percent; the 10-year notes at a price to yield 9.05 percent, and the 30-year bonds at a price to yield 9 percent. **********Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds had all but evaporated by the time the Treasury made its announcement. **********Corporate dealers said that prices of most issues were unchanged to down one-eighth of a point. In the municipal market, prices were unchanged to up one-eighth, traders said. **********No new taxable issues were priced yesterday, but in the tax-exempt market the State of Wisconsin offered $71.415 million of general obligation bonds at competitive bid. **********A bid from Bear, Stearns & Company and Morgan, Stanley won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1990 to 2009.

Half the wilderness has since been cleared to harvest hardwoods and to open thin, easily eroded soils to subsistence farming. If deforestation continues at the current pace, Costa Rica will run out of trees by the year 2015, with much of this fragile land ending up as low-quality pasture or scrub too poor to cultivate. **********But that is not likely to happen. Government officials - notably the ebullient Minister of Natural Resoures, Alvaro Umana, a physicist-turned-ecologist - have awakened to the prospect of economic disaster. They have locked up a third of the remaining forest and restricted development on another third. And they are encouraging ''debt for nature'' swaps, a form of economic alchemy in which chunks of Costa Rica's foreign debt are converted to a conservation endowment. **********The swaps could certainly help slow deforestation throughout the tropics, where land is being cleared at the startling rate of 100 acres a minute. But few countries are in a position to exploit such deals as skillfully as Costa Rica. And even in Costa Rica there are limits to what swaps can accomplish. The challenge is to find a way, once and for all, to link write-offs of third world debt to environmental planning on a grand scale. **********Costa Rica's latest initiative, announced last month, follows a now-familiar pattern. American Express Bank, a large creditor to Costa Rica (but far from its largest), sold $5.6 million in Costa Rican i.o.u.'s to the Nature Conservancy for $784,000. The Washington-based environmental group then traded the paper back to the Costa Rican central bank for $1.7 million in local-currency bonds, with the interest to be paid to a local conservation group to manage nine projects. **********American Express got a tax deduction - as it would with any bad debt once realized. The Costa Rican central bank retired a bit of its $1.5 billion debt to foreign banks and the Nature Conservancy doubled the purchasing power of its cash donation. **********If everyone benefited from a $5.6 million swap, why not think big? Why not 100 times $5.6 million? For one thing, banks holding Costa Rican debt may not be ready to dump so much of it at the current market rate of just 14 cents on the dollar. For another, conservation groups could not possibly raise 14 percent of $560 million from private donors. **********Then there is the problem of diverting scarce local resources to conservation. Costa Rica would be reluctant to raise taxes sufficiently to cover the interest on $170 million worth of local-currency bonds. If the central bank simply printed the money, it would have to cope with the resulting increase in purchasing power. Mr. Umana believes that no more than $15 million in foreign debt can be reabsorbed annually without unacceptable inflationary pressures. **********Similar constraints limit the scale of such deals elsewhere. Bolivia, Ecuador and the Philippines have exchanged debt for local currency plus commitment to preservation. But these and future swaps are too small to dent the global problem. **********Indeed, it is not clear that the swaps will be used at all in places where they are needed most. In Brazil, the country with by far the most forest to lose, developers call debt-for-nature deals the work of foreign devils. President Jose Sarney, engulfed in an economic crisis that threatens to topple his constitutional Government, denounced the swaps as an affront to Brazilian sovereignty. **********How then to protect the vanishing jungle? One approach is to create preservation plans that serve the interests of developers. In Costa Rica that will not be difficult. Tourism is a rapidly growing source of income and employment, and Mr. Umana said one tourist in three chooses Costa Rica for its natural diversity and beauty. The Ministry of Natural Resources is also pressing ''sustainable cultivation'' techniques for hardwood forests, cycles of harvesting that permit regrowth and retard erosion. **********But most of the world's tropical forests will be long gone before the desperately poor nations that control their destiny focus their attention on the problem. If the forests are to be saved, it will take a lot of help from the developed world. **********There are reasons beyond altruism and respect for nature for investing in a crash effort: tropical forests serve as both the primary source of cultivable plant species and as collectors of carbon dioxide. There is even a convenient mechanism for the investment. Forgiveness of much of the third world's $1.2 trillion hard-currency debt through officially sponsored settlements is now widely viewed as inevitable. If such settlements are linked to enforceable preservation commitments, the great forests may yet be granted a reprieve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/business/dividend-meetings-625789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of Dec. 3, 1989:          MONDAY        Albertsons Inc   Harnischfeger Inds        Cincinnati Bell   Jamesway Corp        Davis Wtr & Wst   Standard Prods Co        TUESDAY        Alaska Air Grp   Illinois Pwr Co        American Stores Co   Lennar Corp        Angell Real Estate   Premier Indl Corp        Browning Ferris Inds   Unocal Corp        Chyron Corp   Witco Corp        WEDNESDAY        Capital Hldg Corp   Helmerich & Payne        Corning Inc   Louisville G&E        Corroon & Black Corp   Neiman-Marcus Group        Deere & Co   Peoples Engy Corp        Desoto Inc   Portland Gen Corp        Fieldcrest Cannon   Stanhome Inc        General Dynamics   Starret Co        Green Moutain Pwr   Times Mirror Co        Handelman Co   TIS Mtg Invst        THURSDAY        Allegheny Pwr Sys   General Host Corp        Amax Inc   Gen Pub Utils Corp        Atlantic Energy Inc   Natl Fuel Gas Co NJ        Brown Group Inc   RLI Corp        Finevest Foods Inc   Rockefeller Ctr Pptys        Flight Saftey Intl   SPS Technologies        FRIDAY        Abbott Labs   Quick & Reilly Grp        Lowes Cos Inc   Strategic Mtg Invts"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/world/boa-vista-journal-this-is-el-dorado-gold-and-death-in-the-jungle.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1989-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boa Vista Journal; This Is El Dorado?

Today, Brazil produces about 100 tons of gold a year, triple the production at the start of the decade. **********Here in Roraima, a territory that is scheduled to achieve full statehood next year, claim jumping, gunfights and plane crashes in the rain forest are the currency of the day. **********The newspaper Critica captured the spirit of Boa Vista today with a banner headline: ''Eight dead in firefight in Roraima gold camp.'' **********Since the gold rush started in earnest about a year ago, more than 400 miners have died in gunfights or in plane crashes. In a frontier where many people are known only by their nicknames, most burials amount to litle more than a few words from a priest and a circle of friends standing at graveside, hats in hand. **********Last January, during the dry season, overworked bush planes were crashing at the rate of one a day. That month, air traffic become so thick -7,995 takeoffs and landings - that the local civil aviation director announced that Boa Vista airport was Brazil's busiest. **********In the last two years, commercial flights from Manaus, the nearest major city, have increased from one a week to four. The number of buses plying the 400-mile route has tripled. **********The fact that the gold rush is taking place on traditional lands of the Yanomami Indians, South America's largest unassimilated tribe, does not disturb the gold seekers. **********''The opening of the Brazilian frontier is just like the American pioneers, with covered wagons, fighting Indians,'' said Athos Vieira, an ebullient gold and diamond mine operator, piloting his Dodge toward a dirt airstrip behind the Jockey Club, the city's racetrack. ''We don't have horses, we have airplanes.'' Keeping the Planes Flying **********The improvised airstrip captured the single-minded pursuit of gold that has gripped the territory. Without the formalities of flight plans, radar or mechanical inspections, small planes took off and landed at the rate of one every five minutes. Under a flapping blue tarpaulin, grease-stained mechanics - earning more than they could in a Sao Paulo automobile factory - labored to keep aging Pipers and Cessnas airworthy. **********''There are 126 strips out there, and a new one opening every day,'' said Valdeni Lopes de Oliveira, a pilot who goes by the name Baby Onion. Aeronautical maps of Roraima show only three officially designated airstrips. **********One of the Amazon air jockeys is an American nuclear physics professor who found he could make 10 times as much money flying here than he could teaching in Sao Paulo, 2,500 miles to the South. **********Miners and pilots also say they are are tired of outsiders who complain about the decimation of the Indians. ''The U.S. gave us the example,'' Baby Onion said as he dug into a $5 plate of beef and rice at the airport.

A huge sign on the side of the Stew Leonard's store reads, ''World's Largest Dairy Store, as Featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' **********But along with selling broccoli and bran, Mr. Leonard is also marketing the secret of his success. The store has become something of a business mecca, luring worshipers from near and far. Various companies - Wendy's, Wal-Mart, Marriott and even Union Carbide - as well as the United States Postal Service, have sent executives to study the store's methods. And about once a week Mr. Leonard's two sons, Stew Jr. and Tommy, describe their success in speeches to business groups nationwide, at $10,000 a shot. What they pay to hear is how, in a business where sales per square foot typically run $300 to $500 a year, Mr. Leonard and the singing milk cartons last year brought in $3,100. A key to this success is the dedication of customers, who talk of the place with loyalty usually reserved for trusted pediatricians or auto mechanics; many drive from New York or New Jersey to shop here but can get no closer than a satellite parking lot, from which they willingly navigate their shopping carts across the four busy lanes of Route 1. **********For Mr. Leonard, a 59-year-old former milkman who went into the grocery business 20 years ago when a new state highway displaced the family dairy company, success comes from breaking the rules. He is well versed on the two inviolate principles of supermarkets - stock everything, so the customer never has to go to a competitor, and keep costs down by belonging to a chain -both of which he gleefully turns upside down. He runs a single store and carries only a few hundred items, while a typical Pathmark or A.&P. stocks more than 25,000. **********With selection so limited, what is it that keeps the customers coming? First, the store is fun - even a tourist attraction - and most say the food is fresher and the prices generally lower than in most supermarkets. Stew Leonard's bills itself as a dairy store but is primarily a combination butcher shop, bakery and fish and produce market. Lesson in Innovation **********Some in the aisles are obviously not shoppers. Wandering through on a recent afternoon, for example, were Kenneth H. Perry, director of business development at the Bristol-Myers Company's international division, in Wilton, Conn., and Ken Yasuda of the company's Tokyo office. Mr. Perry said he brings visitors here to show them ''how innovative people can be.'' **********Some analysts who follow the publicly traded supermarkets are also impressed by Stew Leonard's, which is family owned. **********''The place is phenomenal,'' said Susan D. Spielberg, who follows Giant Food, Kroger and Albertson's for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. but drives from New York to shop at Stew Leonard's. ''It's an event, an amusement park, a place to bring the kids.'' **********She has no children, but when she comes here, Ms. Spielberg said, ''I'm a child at heart.'' 'I Try to Make it Fun' **********''Everyone feels supermarket shopping is drudgery,'' Mr. Leonard said in an interview in his office above the selling floor. ''I try to make it fun.'' **********Mr. Leonard himself clearly has the most fun greeting customers, and most are delighted to see him. As he made his way through the produce section, Dr. Shelley Dreisman of Westport, Conn., happily shook his hand, but her daughter, Emily, 6, shyly turned away. ''She only wants to shake hands with the cow,'' Dr. Dreisman explained. **********That cow, it turns out, is often Mr. Leonard, too. When the burdens of running a $100 million business seem too great, he puts on a cow suit he keeps in his office closet and goes out and hugs customers. Limited Selection a Trade-Off **********The limited selection is part of a trade-off. A gallon of Tide detergent goes for $6.99, compared with $8.79 at the Pathmark a mile to the west on Route 1. Want another brand? Better go to Pathmark, which has 68 other choices, counting all sizes and brands. **********If he is selling dog food, that means one brand, one size. Want plastic wrap? Maybe. Toothpicks? Probably not; try A.&P. **********''I am forcing my own wife to shop someplace else,'' Mr. Leonard said. When she does so, the competitor gets the opportunity to tempt her with the same items Mr. Leonard sells. He can prosper, he said, only by selling milk, meat and produce that are better and cheaper. ''I'm on my toes,'' he said. Mr. Leonard has his own rules, carved in granite at the entrance: ''Rule 1: The customer is always right. Rule 2: If the customer is ever wrong, reread Rule 1.'' Customers Who Were Right **********A visit to Stew Leonard's is a mixture of fun and business. As Mr. Leonard described the autobiography he is working on, his office was filled with the strains of ''Dixie'' as performed by a 6-foot, banjo-playing animated dog perched above the frozen pasta in a vaguely Confederate army uniform. Mr. Leonard insists all the corniness is good business, and traces two recent successes to ideas from the customer suggestion box. **********One was to sell strawberries loose, like tomatoes, in the big flat trays from the farm, not in plastic one-pint baskets. **********The produce manager said that if the strawberries were set out loose, people would eat them and the leftovers would never sell. He turned out to be right, but customers who can choose strawberries individually will drop them into plastic bags without watching the total, Mr. Leonard discovered, and some will buy $12 worth. Sales tripled. Turkey Suggestion Pays Off **********Then there were the turkey dinners. Mr. Leonard was selling them with vegetable and stuffing, fresh but refrigerated, at $5.95 each, and roasting just three turkeys a day in the store's kitchens to keep up with demand. A customer suggested selling them at the hot-food bar, a growing part of the business, so he did, and demand jumped to 21 turkeys a day. **********But some customers said they did not like paying $2.99 a pound for the gravy mixed in, or that the gravy had too many calories. Others said there was not enough gravy. So he started putting the gravy on the side, and demand rose to more than 50 turkeys a day. **********With about 100,000 customers a week, the aisles are jammed most of the 16 hours the store is open daily. Two parking lots across Route 1 have spaces for a total of 200 cars, while the main parking lot, with spaces for 360, is always full, with a dozen uniformed, armed guards keeping order. (Their guns are rarely required, Mr. Leonard said, but with sales of as much as $500,000 on a recent Saturday, robberies are a threat. ''I have more money here than most local banks do,'' he said.) Average Sale: $65 The trick, then, is to get each shopper to buy as much as possible. The average sale is about $65. By contrast, the average household spends about $61.50 a week in supermarkets, in 2.4 trips, or about $26 a trip, according to the Food Marketing Institute, an industry trade group, To spur sales, the soft-ice-cream shop at the store entrance gives a $1 cone free for each cash register tape of $100 or more. And Mr. Leonard said it costs him nothing, since most of those $100 purchases are made by shoppers who arrive with a spouse or children, and for each cone he gives away - at a cost he puts at 50 cents -another will be bought. **********Even the petting zoo serves several purposes. To hear Mr. Leonard tell it, it was an afterthought. When he sought to buy the property 20 years ago, the elderly woman who owned it insisted on keeping her farm animals on it. Zoo Animals Well Fed **********Now, farmers lend him baby animals, which he periodically exchanges for younger models. The farmers like the arrangement, he said, because the animals come back well fed. Mr. Leonard pays for part of their diet, but the animals also get food from shoppers, who buy it in the store. **********Another key, he insists, is friendly employees. All wear name tags. Each month, an employee's color photo goes on a plaque as ''superstar of the month.'' And the store seems to crawl with employees, although sales per employee are higher than in most supermarkets because volume is so high. **********Lots of ideas do not pan out, but with 40 cash registers linked to a single computer, Mr. Leonard can tell within an hour if an item is not moving. And if it does not move fast, he cuts the price or moves it to a different part of the store - quickly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/world/baker-plans-visit-to-moscow-in-may-to-discuss-summit.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1989-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1372, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAKER PLANS VISIT TO MOSCOW IN MAY TO DISCUSS SUMMIT", "print_headline": "BAKER PLANS VISIT TO MOSCOW IN MAY TO DISCUSS SUMMIT", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that he would go to Moscow in May to discuss the resumption of strategic-arms negotiations and the prospects for President Bush's first summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********Mr. Baker laid out his plans after meeting for more than two hours in Vienna with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. It was the first high-level contact between the Bush Administration and the Soviet leadership. **********Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze, who met a day after both addressed an East-West conference, said they had agreed to a wide-ranging negotiating session in Moscow in the first half of May. Mr. Baker told Mr. Shevardnadze that the Bush Administration would complete its review of the negotiations on long-range nuclear missiles by the end of April. Meet in Wooded Suburb **********The two officials met at the residence of the United States Ambassador to Austria, Henry A. Grunwald, in a wooded Vienna suburb. They began by meeting alone, except for interpreters, for 1 hour and 7 minutes, and then held a session including 12-member delegations from each side and lasting an additional hour. **********Surveying Mr. Baker's delegation, Mr. Shevardnadze said, ''I see that in the American delegation there are some new faces.'' Mr. Shevardnadze had held 31 meetings with Mr. Baker's predecessor, George P. Shultz. Mideast on the Agenda **********According to the two officials, today's talks included topics like the Middle East, on which Mr. Baker told the Soviets that the Administration did not favor an international conference at this time, and the conventional-arms talks, on which both sides expressed optimism that the opening bargaining positions presented by NATO and the Warsaw Pact were close enough to make a conventional arms treaty in Europe a real possibility. The talks will formally open in Vienna on Thursday. **********Reporters aboard Mr. Baker's plane, which stopped in Ireland on the way to Washington, were told after the meeting that if there was one impression that the Secretary of State took home it was just how concerned the Soviets were that President Bush, in his policy reviews, might diverge from the path of improving Soviet-American relations begun under Ronald Reagan. **********What Mr. Shevardnadze most wanted to know from Mr. Baker, reporters were told, was whether the Bush Administration was ''serious about moving the improvement of this relationship forward.'' **********''He was seeking some reassurance from us that we really saw the overall relationship in the same sense as the Reagan Administration, and we conveyed that we do,'' the reporters were told. **********Mr. Baker said that he had told Mr. Shevardnadze that the restructuring that Mr. Gorbachev is instituting as Soviet leader was ''good for the U.S.S.R., good for the rest of the world and that we really hope the Soviets succeed, but that their success depends on the Soviets, not us.'' **********Regarding the Start negotiations limiting strategic nuclear weapons, which were suspended in December, Mr. Baker said he informed Mr. Shevardnadze that ''our review of the strategic arms talks was moving along, and that we would expect that to be completed toward the end of April.'' Mr. Baker said he also told his Soviet counterpart that the Administration's strategic modernization review would also be completed at that time. **********The Bush Administration has put the largely completed Start negotiations on hold pending a reassessment of the treaty as it has been negotiated to date by the Reagan Administration. Other Discussions Planned **********Mr. Shevardnadze said he specifically proposed resuming these negotiations on long-range missiles in April or May, but when this proved unacceptable, it was agreed that ''we meet again in the first half of May in Moscow.'' At that time, he added, the two sides would ''probably be able to reach agreements on a date for resuming negotiations on nuclear and space arms'' as well as, ''discuss the prospects for a summit meeting.'' **********Another major item of discussion between the two officials appears to have been the Middle East, where the Soviet Union and the European Community have been pressing for the convening of an international peace conference. **********Mr. Baker said he told Mr. Shevardnadze that the Bush Administration believes ''an international conference would be counterproductive.'' He said, ''We think that lower level work on the ground to bring about an atmosphere and a climate that can help lead to direct negotiation between the parties is what is needed.'' Dialogue With P.L.O. Continues **********Mr. Baker, later on board his plane, added: ''When I say that we have reservations about an international conference, that we need to work the ground carefully and that we don't want to pre-empt more promising possibilities, I am not suggesting that the United States would not consider an international conference properly structured, if we felt it could lead to direct negotiations between the parties.'' **********Reporters traveling with the Secretary of State were also told that the Bush Administration intended to continue its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. In what seemed to be a signal to the Israelis to stop calling on Washington to sever that dialogue because of clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian guerrillas in South Lebanon, reporters were told that Mr. Baker's view was that the confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians to date were not terrorism and did not constitute a cause for breaking off the dialogue. **********At the same time, in an apparent warning to the P.L.O., the reporters were also told that Mr. Baker ''would know terrorism when he saw it'' and that if he saw the P.L.O. engaging in it it could mean the end of the dialogue. **********The Secretary of State also brought up with Mr. Shevardnadze Moscow's actions in the diplomatic dispute over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against the British author Salman Rushdie. **********He informed his Soviet counterpart that the United States was not interested in encouraging Iran to ''make trouble for the U.S.S.R.'' and that Mr. Shevardnadze, by going to Teheran two weeks and adopting a neutral stance on the controversy over Mr. Rushdie's book ''The Satanic Verses'' appeared to be trying to protect the Iranians at precisely the moment when the international community was trying to isolate them because of their death threats. **********Speaking of the Warsaw Pact's proposal that both it and NATO reduce their artillery, tanks and armored personnel carriers in Europe to levels 10 to 15 percent below the current NATO strength, Mr. Baker observed that this was ''remarkably close to the NATO proposal.'' **********''I think that when you compare the Warsaw Pact position with the NATO position these conventional arms talks are off to a pretty good start,'' Mr. Baker said. The Secretary of State quickly added, though, that Moscow's insistence that naval units, tactical fighter aircraft and short-range nuclear missiles also be included in the conventional arms negotiations now opening were unacceptable to the United States. **********Mr. Shevardnadze for his part said in Vienna that Moscow ''categorically cannot accept'' that aircraft and troop levels should be considered something outside the boundaries of the European conventional arms talks. But Mr. Shevardnadze concluded by saying that ''this is a negotiating process and I believe we will find mutually acceptable positions.''  Bush Talks of Central America **********WASHINGTON, March 7 (AP) - President Bush said today that there ''clearly has to be some linkage'' between American policy toward the Soviet Union and Soviet behavior in Central America. **********Officials here have long complained about Soviet military aid to the leftist Nicaraguan Government. **********The Bush Administration has said it is hopeful the Soviets might change their Central American policy. **********At a news conference today, the President said: ''The more help we can get towards that end by the Soviets, with pulling back their large amount of military support, the better it would be between relations. So there is linkage.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/30/business/company-news-tambrands-is-up-on-buyback-move.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tambrands Is Up On Buyback Move", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Tambrands Is Up On Buyback Move", "body_text": " **********The stock of Tambrands Inc. jumped $1 a share, to $60.50, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange in response to the company's announcement on Wednesday that it would repurchase up to 1.125 million shares and that it might sell its diagnostics and cosmetics operations.

Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and reflected his growing ideological isolation within the Eastern bloc. At the meeting off Malta, Mr. Bush called on Mr. Gorbachev to do more to prevent Cuba from shipping arms to Nicaragua and to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador and also offered to assist Mr. Gorbachev in carrying out economic reforms. Doesn't Mention Names **********Speaking at ceremonies honoring Cuban combatants killed in the course of ''internationalist missions'' in Angola, Ethiopia and other African countries, Mr. Castro did not criticize Mr. Gorbachev or any Eastern European leader by name. But he complained of the difficulty of building a Communist state when others are ''slandering socialism, destroying its values, discrediting the party and liquidating its leading role, doing away with social discipline and sowing chaos and anarchy everywhere.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, or restructuring and openness, have aroused interest in Cuba, which experimented briefly with a degree of economic liberalization early in the decade but then reversed course with a ''rectification'' program after Mr. Castro decided that some people were making too much money and egalitarianism was eroding. The Soviet leader received a warm popular welcome when he visited Cuba in April, but Mr. Castro has rejected many of Mr. Gorbachev's innovations as violations of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. **********The transformations taking place elsewhere in the Soviet bloc coincide with Cuba's most serious political and leadership crisis in years. In July, several senior Cuban military officials were executed for drug trafficking in circumstances that have yet to be fully explained, and economic and morale problems have also forced Mr. Castro, who is 63 years old and has been in power for more than 30 years, to shake up his Cabinet. **********The Cuban leader has long feared that the lessening of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union will translate into changes in the military status quo in Europe that would increase Washington's ability to impose its own views elsewhere, including the Caribbean. He also remains firmly committed to the principle of ''proletarian internationalism,'' a justification for intervention abroad that he fears is on the wane elsewhere. Soviet-Cuban Meeting **********According to reports from Managua, the Soviet Ambassador there met with Nicaraguan and Cuban officials on Nov. 28, just days after Mr. Bush had blamed the Soviet Union for supplying arms to Mr. Castro that eventually ended up in the hands of rebels in El Salvador. ''We are hearing that he really read them the riot act,'' said a European diplomat based in the Nicaraguan capital. **********The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported on Thursday that American forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station had fired twice on Cuban sentries outside, calling the incident ''serious and of unpredictable consequences.'' Today, a Pentagon spokesman denied the charge, saying ''no weapons or rounds ever crossed the fence line.'' **********In his address, Mr. Castro justified the prohibition in Cuba of some Soviet publications, such as Sputnik and Moscow News. He said the measure was necessary because such publications were ''filled with venom against the U.S.S.R. itself and against socialism'' and have ''demanded the cessation of just and equitable commercial relations between the U.S.S.R. and Cuba.'' **********Since the early 1960's the Soviet Union has heavily subsidized the Cuban economy through such measures as the purchase of Cuban sugar at prices well above market levels and the sale at bargain rates of petroleum, some of which Cuba then resells to gain hard currency. Those subsidies, amounting to as much as $5 billion a year, have increasingly been questioned by Soviet officials as part of the economic restructuring that is under way. **********'Negative Economic Consequences' **********''From the crisis that has emerged in the socialist camp, we can only expect negative economic consequences for our country,'' Mr. Castro said. **********Just hours before Mr. Castro's appearance at the war commemoration ceremonies, during which he was accompanied by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, the Cuban Government for the first time announced casualty figures for the more than 400,000 soldiers and ''technical advisers'' it has sent to fight in Africa over the last 15 years.

The deal was worth about $50,000.  Indian officials said the sale of the chemical, thionyl chloride, was not a breach of local laws because it is a freely traded commodity used to make pesticides. Further Sales Are Reported **********There are also reports that the company that sold the chemical to the State Trading Corporation for the March shipment, Transpek Private Ltd., a private chemical producer, is planning to sell 257 tons of the chemical to Iran next month. The transaction was reportedly arranged by Rheineisen Chemical Products of West Germany and may violate that country's export laws, officials there say. **********India is one of a handful of countries making thionyl chloride. Other major producers are West Germany and the United States. **********''There are no restrictions in India on the sale of this commodity and it has been an item that we have traded across the world,'' the Indian trading official said in an interview. He declined to be further identified, and he could not say whether the chemical, which can be used in mustard gas, had earlier been sold to Iran. In its eight-year war with Iraq, Iran used mustard gas, and the Teheran Government is believed to be stockpiling chemical weapons. 'Benevolent Uses' **********''We are more familiar with its benevolent uses as a pesticide, in the making of life-saving drugs,'' the Indian official said. The official said while he did not have figures for the total production of thionyl chloride in the country, much of the product was used by pesticide and other companies in India. **********Other officials said India imported the product until 1984. But as part of an import substitution drive aimed at saving foreign exchange, Indian industrialists were encouraged to produce the material for export. At least one other Indian company, Bharat Pulverizing Mills Private Ltd. of Bombay, produces the chemical. **********The Indian trading official said that at the end of March the chemical was shipped through the Arab emirate of Dubai and then transported to an Iranian port. The manufacturer was identified as Transpek Private, which is based in the western Indian city of Baroda and has an office in Bombay. Company Confirms Sale **********A spokesman for Transpek tonight confirmed that the company had supplied the chemical that the State Trading Corporation sold to Iran. He declined to comment on reports that his company was involved in plans to sell 257 tons of thionyl chloride to Iran through Rheineisen. **********A Transpek official said on Thursday that a trading company at Dubai had opened a line of credit to buy more thionyl chloride.

Mirza Aslam Beg. **********In his talk, General Beg went out of his way to express support for the democratic process while acknowledging past military failures and commenting on national policies. His remarks are being interpreted as an attempt to burnish the army's image and place it above the fray. **********Pakistanis of varying political views say that underlying the turbulent political atmosphere has been the inability of both parties to move from campaign oratory to policies needed to address Pakistan's pressing problems. **********''Everyone is running wild,'' a university president said. ''They think this is democracy. We haven't had democracy in 40 years.'' **********Tahir Mirza, managing editor of the independent political journal Viewpoint, who is generally sympathetic to the Government, said that Ms. Bhutto, under pressure to reward party members loyal to her late father, presides over an ''immature'' administration burdened by unqualified people. **********On Wednesday, Javed Jabbar, a popular former filmmaker, was removed as Ms. Bhutto's Information Minister after complaining about political interference by her advisers. Legislative Efforts Lag **********Ms. Bhutto's Government has yet to submit a legislative program. Recent polls by Gallup Pakistan show that Ms. Bhutto is slipping in popularity, while support for Mr. Sharif grows.

That amount is matched by another $100 million from American companies. **********Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat and the subcommittee's chairman, said he was ''concerned over recent reports of attempts by Administration officials to drastically reduce or eliminate funding for a number of existing programs, such as Sematech.'' **********Those reports emerged earlier this month when four lawmakers, in a letter sent to President Bush, said they had learned of classified and unclassified documents that called for cutting programs financed by the Defense Advanced Researched Projects Agency. The programs believed under jeopardy included Sematech. **********The other Pentagon-financed programs facing cutbacks, according to the letter and comments by Senator Bingaman today, include manufacturing technology to develop robots and other computer-assisted equipment; high-definition computer displays, which involves an advanced technology that provides a much sharper television picture, and X-ray lithography, a technique used for producing powerful semiconductor chips. **********Senator Bingaman said the Defense Department ''has an appropriate role in supporting research in long-term, high-risk, high-potential technologies.'' **********Dr. Bromley, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, testified that he shares the concerns about American leadership in semiconductors expressed in the recent report by the advisory committee, which was created in Congress's trade bill last year.

The message met with broad skepticism from rebel Nicaraguan commanders and troops, who said the demobilization plan, signed by five Central American presidents in August, is inadequate to insure democratic change in Nicaragua. **********But commission members, addressing 2,500 uniformed fighters in a light rain, bluntly reminded the rebels of their international isolation. They argued that the plan was the best option for a rebel force whose reason for being, they said, has disappeared. **********''You are Nicaraguans, patriots and people of Nicaragua,'' said Francesc Vendrell, a senior United Nations official and commission member. ''Don't let yourselves become the subject of a policy that perhaps has already become an anachronism, and don't stay here to be abandoned by a country that once helped you.'' Supported by U.S. Aid **********Mr. Vendrell declined to specify the nation, but it was widely interpreted to be the United States, which had a central role in fostering and supporting the rebel movement. **********The fighters who remain in Yamales are supported primarily by $49 million in aid from the United States under an agreement reached last spring between the Bush Administration and Congressional leaders. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 other fighters are in Nicaragua, where a cease-fire remains in force. **********The special commission, composed of representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States, was created in August after the Central American presidents, meeting in Tela, Honduras, signed an accord calling for the ''voluntarly demobilization, repatriation or relocation'' of the rebel army within 90 days. **********The commission is charged with overseeing the demobilization and guaranteeing the safety of the former rebels who choose to return to Nicaragua. The process depends on the willingness of contra units to give up their eight-year struggle against the Sandinista Government, and the commission has found itself at the center of complex and often bitter emotions about the future of the contra movement. Concern About Families **********During their visit today, Mr. Vendrell and his counterpart from the O.A.S., Hugo de Zela, met with members of a contra negotiating committee headed by a top rebel official, Enrique Bermudez. They also met with contra officers and representatives of the estimated 50,000 family members and dependents that share hundreds of makeshift huts that cling to the steep, wooded hillsides here. **********Seated in a green canvas tent with United States Army markings, the two commission members spent more than an hour with 43 contra battalion commanders, urging them to respond to the call for demobilization while ''the eyes of Central America are upon you.'' **********The officers, who sat with their weapons on rough wooden benches, derided guarantees that the Nicaraguan Government would respect former contra fighters or its promises for democratic change. **********''There is still tremendous persecution of rural people in the mountains of Nicaragua - and these people are families,'' said one officer. ''What will happen when, the day after the election, there is still repression in Nicaragua? What will happen then?'' **********Those arguments were repeated frequently today by rank-and-file contra troops, whose morale does not appear to have fallen significantly despite the demobilization agreement. Troops interviewed today said there had not been much desertion. #3 Negotiating Points But the commission members stressed the practical limitations of the contras' position, which has little international support. American officials acknowledge that there is little chance for new military aid to the rebel army, and the movement's Miami headquarters was recently closed. **********''You've been very candid with me, and I'll be very candid with you,'' Mr. Vendrell said. ''The resistance is not going to be reactivated.'' **********Leaving the camp for the difficult five-hour jeep ride back to the Honduran capital, commission members said they had been given three negotiating points, which they would not divulge, to raise with Sandinista leaders. They said they also hoped to encourage direct contacts between the two sides, from family visits to official negotiations, to foster trust and reconciliation. **********''When we met these mothers here, we were seeing the same mothers that we could see in Managua, crying and looking for ther children,'' Mr. Vendrell said. ''On both sides you have people from the countryside who have lost their children and who have suffered because of the war. They are the same people, and they don't often realize how similar they both are.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/opec-seeks-kuwait-and-emirate-oil-cut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPEC Seeks Kuwait and Emirate Oil Cut", "print_headline": "OPEC Seeks Kuwait and Emirate Oil Cut", "body_text": " **********An OPEC majority tried today to persuade two Persian Gulf Arab states, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, to agree to cut oil output, for fear that their excess production could weaken prices early in 1990. **********Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were huddled in caucus groups in their hotel suites here on the second day of talks aimed at setting new output quotas, effective Jan. 1. 'Plenty of Ideas' **********''There have been plenty of ideas, but we're still working,'' Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, said. **********Kuwait and the Emirates, which are among the wealthiest members, have effectively boycotted OPEC accords for most of 1989 because the majority would not give them quotas as generous as they wanted. They have produced as they pleased, taking total OPEC output above 23 million barrels a day. **********But other members are concerned that unless producers exercise some restraint in their output, prices could fall in the early part of next year. **********''OPEC will have to agree to a cut in output of around 1.5 million barrels a day to have any chance of maintaining current prices,'' said Steve Turner, an oil analyst with a London brokerage firm, Smith New Court. **********The global economy is expected to slow down, and that is expected to brake the rebound in demand for OPEC oil. In addition, North Sea oil is now flowing steadily after recent interruptions caused by accidents. **********A Gulf Arab source said most of the 13 members believed that a ceiling on total OPEC supply could be safely set at 21.5 million barrels daily and perhaps as high as 22 million if all members agreed to stick to the rules. **********The ministers are now grappling with the problem of getting Kuwait and the Emirates in under that ceiling. A compromise would require the two states to cut their output and oblige other members to cede some of their share of the total allowable OPEC volume. **********The biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, has so far refused to accept anything less than its current 24.46 percent share of whatever OPEC sells and shows no sign of easing that stance. Another Makeshift Package **********A failure to compromise would force OPEC to settle for a ''pro rata'' deal. That is shorthand for another makeshift package, probably again excluding Kuwait and the Emirates, in which new quotas would be assigned on the basis of existing percentage shares. **********Consumers are not likely to be affected much either way.

Style magazine. But in a huge market that still offers few ways to reach young consumers with thousands to spend on everything from makeup to a Mercedes, the marriage appears to be working for both. **********The oversize monthly, begun in 1985 and acquired in May 1987, will carry 1,800 pages of advertising this year, more than double the number two years earlier. While it has not been profitable, Tom Ryder, president of American Express Publishing, thinks it will break even by 1990. If it continues to gain momentum, the magazine would give American Express more reach in the second-largest market for its credit-card holders. The 'Hot' Book Now **********American Express also owns Travel & Leisure, Food & Wine and New York Woman. But advertising and magazine executives say L.A. Style is the ''hot'' book. While David Lehmkuhl, president of International Media Futures, a consulting firm for magazines, said he does not really understand the allure of the magazine or why it is considered hot, he added that it is probably a case of being in the right place at the right time. **********''L.A. is probably hungry for a magazine about L.A.,'' he said. ''That's their trump card. The alternatives in L.A. are weak.'' **********Indeed, if New York is oversaturated with publications, Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest market, has surprisingly few. Los Angeles magazine is a monthly; the region has no mass-market weekly comparable to New York magazine. There are also no monthlies like Manhattan,inc. or Avenue. **********For years, New York publishers virtually ignored the West Coast. ''The publishing industry is here in New York and people looked at people from California like they were from Mars,'' said Douglas Johnston, publisher of Vanity Fair magazine. **********L.A. Style's circulation is only 75,000 in a market of 8.5 million people. That is in part because publishers of tony magazines emphasize an elite audience and in part because attracting readers here is more difficult than in other markets. **********Mr. Lehmkuhl noted that Los Angeles is more of an outdoor culture and is a lower user of all media except radio. That means magazines in general have a harder time. A Growing Competition **********Nevertheless, publishers are paying more attention because the demographics are so good. Vanity Fair is adding a special Southern California edition. Manhattan,inc. has run an increasing number of movie-industry stories. California magazine has started Angeles, on home decoration. **********American Express, meanwhile, latched on to L.A. Style. The magazine had been started by Karen Fund, 41 years old, now the publisher and formerly the associate publisher at L.A. Weekly and the publisher of Millimeter, and Joie Davidow, 32, the editor of L.A. Style and the founder of L.A. Weekly. **********''L.A. Style is young without being childish, and it predicts trends and has interesting information,'' said Raulee Marcus, senior vice president for marketing at Neutrogena, the maker of skin- and hair-care products. The 15- by 11-inch magazine, which sells for $3, contains articles, generally short, about travel, celebrities, architecture, stores, restaurants, music and clothes. Pictures are as important as copy. And models glare out from advertisements that are nearly poster sized. **********When Ms. Fund was at L.A. Weekly, ''upscale fashion and cosmetics advertisers kept saying they wanted to be in the Los Angeles market, but they didn't want their ads in a free paper printed on newspaper stock.'' A Slow Beginning **********But when L.A. Style began, readers did not find it quickly. Soon Ms. Fund, Ms. Davidow and their backers had run through the $500,000 earmarked to start up. **********Mr. Ryder at American Express saw an ideal opportunity. **********American Express has an advantage over other magazine publishers. It has a list of 20 million American credit-card members and it can aim at them. ''About 70 percent of them live in the top 20 cities,'' Mr. Ryder said. ''We want magazines in cities where they are. And the advertising side can build its relationships with our customers.'' **********American Express pumped several million dollars into building the circulation from 50,000 to 75,000. Now it is offering advertisers discounts if they appear in both New York Woman and L.A. Style. Stores that accept the American Express card also get discounts in both magazines. **********Even with the incentives, Mr. Ryder maintained, both L.A. Style and New York Woman will be profitable. But a number of industry experts think American Express will find the Los Angeles market easier than New York, where the competition is so much tougher. **********American Express has received generally high marks for Travel & Leisure. Food & Wine is also doing well. New York Woman is perhaps the greatest question mark. Although the company maintains that it is growing in ad pages and circulation, Mr. Lehmkuhl thinks that it is still trying to find where the magazine fits in editorially, and that it will have a tough time because the field is so crowded with established fashion and beauty magazines. **********Ms. Marcus thinks the magazine picks ''gutsy'' subjects but does not always follow through on them. American Express may have a lot of clout, and it can offer a lot of marketing incentives, but if the magazine does not forge its own place in the market, it will not make it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/12/business/business-digest-saturday-august-12-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, AUGUST 12, 1989", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, AUGUST 12, 1989", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********Retail sales surged nine-tenths of 1 percent in July and were also buoyant in the late spring and early summer, the Commerce Department reported, indicating that the economy has been considerably stronger than had been thought.

''At some publications the evaluators suffer from what I call feature nymphomania,'' said Jeff Angus, a former director of the InfoWorld Test Center. ''They never met a feature they didn't like.'' Mr. Angus is editor of the InfoWorld Consumer Product Guide, Volume 1 past year. *********** Performance criteria must be weighed differently for different purchases. If a business is shopping for one or two 33-megahertz 80386-based machines to use as a network file server, speed and performance count more than cost. If it needs 500 computers for general office work, speed might well be less important than cost. ''The weighting we use is an average that reflects our typical reader, who spends $250,000 a year on hardware and software,'' said Michael Miller, executive editor of InfoWorld. ''Not everyone is going to match the average. People have different needs and different interests.'' *********** Testing procedures are not iniform and sometimes have little to do with real-life applications. Many publications devise a battery of tests, called benchmarks; some hardware and software companies tweak their products to perform well on a certain magazine's tests. But benchmarks may not mean much in real life. For example, the important thing about a data base is not how fast it works, but how easily it allows the use to customize an application. ''The CPU analyzer, for example, tells you absolutely everthing can be known about a very small component of the system, but the only thing it proves is how good these computers are at running speed tests,'' Mr. Angus said. *********** To counter ''specmanship,'' or the over-reliance on technical data generated by the benchmarks, the labs go to great lengths to try to reach a balance in objective and subjective tests. Tests are devised to measure performance under conditions that approximate normal office activity. But can anyone be sure the tests are realistic? ''Somebody once told me that you can ask the wrong questions and get right answers, or ask the right questions and get the wrong answers,'' said Andrew Eisner, director of MacUser Labs. ''Our goal is to ask the right questions and get the right answers, and if we're lucky we can do that 90 percent of the time.'' *********** The top pick of a given publication is not necessarily the best product for any one company's needs. Rather, it is thesafest one to buy. The ''best'' rating is given to the product that meets the needs of the ''average'' user. So a product that is ideal for the specific needs of one business may have received a ho-hum rating. *********** The marketplace changes so rapidly that by the time a product roundup appears, there may be new pruducts that were not reviews. After checking the reviews, buyers should consult with dealers and study the news reports in trade publications. *********** Unlike Consumer Reports, which buys the products its tests and which does not accept advertising, virtually all the computer trade publications depend on advertising and borrow the products from the manufacuters for a limited period of time. (This newspaper has similar policies.) The editorial and advertising staffs are usually separate, and there is no evidence that nay major publication has altered or withheld an unfavorable evaluation under pressure from the advertisiers. Indeed, all the lab directors said they were fiercely defiant of any attempts by the sales staff to influence a review. **********Many publications implore their readers to think for themselves and give them the tools to evaluate the products on their own. Many reviews include a page describing how the products were selected, how the tests were done and how the results were weighted. In Infoworld, for example, the reader is given the raw data and a scoresheet, from which to calculate a score that reflects the reader's specific bias. ''Think about what you need before you read the article,'' said Mr. Davis of PC Magazine. ''Don't let the article tell you what you need.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/17/business/company-news-l-j-hooker-sells-a-holding.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "L.

'Concrete Results' Cited **********Mr. Salinas, who arrived in the United States on Sunday for his second visit since he took office in December, said the trade accord and an environmental agreement signed during the same ceremony showed that the two countries' friendship ''leads to concrete results.'' **********The environmental accord calls for the Governments to deal with air and other pollution problems in Mexico City and in urban areas at the border. **********Mexico is the third-largest market for American goods, after Canada and Japan, while Mexico sends about three-quarters of its exports to the United States. Trade between the two countries totaled $44 billion last year. Rebuffed Until Recently **********For years the United States had sought closer trade and consultative links with Mexico, but until recently had been rebuffed by Mexico's political leadership, which was entrenched in policies of trade nationalism. **********Under President Salinas and his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, Mexico slowly began developing policies of greater openness in trade and investment. Mr. Salinas, who has a doctorate in political economy from Harvard, served as the minister of budget and planning in the de la Madrid administration. **********The first sign of the shift was Mexico's signature in August 1986 on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter, to which nearly 100 other nations subscribe. Since then Mexico has announced a number of measures to cut tariffs and to dismantle other trade controls. Earlier this year, it removed large parts of foreign investment from official oversight by declaring that acquisitions under $100 million would not need preliminary approval. **********Under the new trade and investment agreement, Mexico and the United States are to decide by November on specific industrial sectors that could benefit from lower tariffs. These might include autos and auto parts, telecommunications, petrochemicals, computers and related equipment and processed foods, an American official said. **********By July, negotiators are to complete a first round of talks on such provisions. Beneficiary of Brady Plan **********In the American view, Mexico is not only more cooperative in trade matters, it is also a model of how a developing country can through market-oriented policies begin to ease its foreign debt burden. **********Its programs to convert state-owned companies to private ownership and its deregulatory policies and lower tariffs have made it a principal beneficiary of a debt-slashing plan put forward by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. **********''I look forward to continued progress and additional proof of how Mexico and the United States can work together toward common ends, toward positive results,'' Mr. Bush told his guest today. On Sunday, Mr. Salinas was his guest at an informal dinner at Camp David. No Free-Trade Pact Seen **********Still, American officials said they did not expect the trade agreement, formally known as the Understanding Between the Government of the United Mexican States and the Government of the United States of America Regarding Trade and Investment Facilitation Talks, to produce anything so far reaching as the free-trade agreement with Canada signed last year. **********''What we have is a series of negotiations in specific product sectors, which, of course, could develop their own momentum, but any free-trade agreement between the two countries is a long way off, if ever,'' an Administration trade official commented. **********A free-trade agreement might well arouse more opposition in both countries than the accord with Canada. In Mexico distrust of the United States has been pronounced over the years, and American labor and business are both sensitive to competition arising from cheap Mexican labor. A 'Significant Evolution' **********Nevertheless, today's agreement, which broadens a 1987 accord providing for consultative talks on trade disputes, is a ''significant evolution'' in the two countries' trading relationship, American officials said. **********The Governments also reached agreements today on steel and textiles and declared that their negotiators had found ''an improved and constructive atmosphere on matters concerning the protection of intellectual property rights to promote technological innovation and investment in Mexico.'' Protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property in Mexico has been a matter of dispute between the two nations for many years. **********On steel, Mexico signed an agreement to limit its shipments to the United States at an undisclosed level over the next two and a half years and to work toward eliminating trade-distorting practices in the sector. **********Mexico is one of 29 countries that have reached new restraint agreements with the United States. Although no specifics of the Mexican pact were available, it was expected that Mexico would be permitted to ship more steel here than it has under its past quotas. **********On textiles, the United States committed itself to ''review and improve'' an import restraint agreement by the two nations. According to a joint communique, the textile agreement provides for ''continued expansion of trade in textiles and apparel in an orderly and nondisruptive manner.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/world/us-asks-syria-to-curb-group-tied-to-terrorism.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1989-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 807, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Asks Syria to Curb Group Tied to Terrorism", "print_headline": "U.S. Asks Syria to Curb Group Tied to Terrorism", "body_text": " **********The United States has asked Syria to curb the activities of a Palestinian organization based in Damascus because of the group's involvement in terrorism, State and Defense Department officials say. **********The United States Ambassador, Edward P. Djerejian, has delivered several private messages to Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria and other Foreign Ministry officials since early January, shortly after the Dec. 17 terrorist bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland. **********The messages have been linked in part to other incidents involving the group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, but have gained new urgency because of mounting concern in Washington over circumstantial evidence that indicates the organization may have been responsible for the bombing. **********Senior Bush Administration officials have stated that the United States has not yet made firm conclusions about who was responsible for the bombing, which killed 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. **********''We have asked the Syrians to control the P.F.L.P.-G.C. and to terminate its terrorist activities,'' a State Department official said. ''We have also asked them to investigate the Pan Am bombing and have said that if the P.F.L.P.-G.C. is implicated, the United States would expect President Assad to live up to his commitments by punishing any terrorists and taking appropriate steps against the organization.'' 'A Menace to the World' **********A senior Defense Department official portrayed the American demarches more bluntly. ''We have told them that the group is a general menace to the world and shouldn't function in Syria,'' the official said. **********President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has assured the United States in the past that he would not tolerate terrorists on Syrian territory, but Syrian officials have insisted in their replies to the American appeals that the Popular Front group is not involved in terrorism. **********The United States has not specifically asked Syria to expel the group from Syrian territory, as it did with the Abu Nidal organization, the Palestinian terrorist group that took responsibility for the Rome and Vienna airport bombings in 1985 and now operates out of Tripoli, Libya, the State Department official said. **********But Administration officials acknowledge that if the Popular Front group's involvement in the Pan Am bombing is decisively proven, the United States will be compelled to force the issue. **********The United States has little leverage over Syria, whose relationship with the group is complicated by the fact that the organization is basically a Syrian creation, receives its financing and weapons from Syria and Libya and is headed by Ahmed Jabril, a former Syrian Army captain. His group is one of several factions that strongly opposes what they view as a policy of compromise toward Israel pursued by Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Jebril Linked to Syria **********A recent report by the State Department's counterterrorism bureau says Mr. Jabril is ''closely allied with, supported by and probably receives direction from Syria.'' **********The United States has also made it clear that Syria can be a responsible player in the Arab-Israeli peace process if an organization like the Popular Front group is firmly controlled. **********''You tell us you want to be players and involved in the peace process, but hosting a group like the P.F.L.P.-G.C. is not consistent with that,'' a senior Administration official said in describing the message that Washington wants to convey to Damascus. **********The United States has long been concerned about the Damascus-based group, but that concern had been tempered by the group's quiescence in recent years. The situation changed in October, when the West German authorities discovered a bomb similar to the device used in the Pan Am bombing in a raid on a group cell in Frankfurt. **********As part of its appeals, the United States asked both West Germany and Japan to press the Syrians to control the group. According to the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Japanese Red Army, a terrorist group, is in the Lebanese Bekaa valley, which is largely under Syrian control. Germans Express Concern **********The West Germans have expressed their concern to Syria because of the Frankfurt arrests, but it unclear whether the Japanese have also weighed in, State Department officials said. **********In early March, the United States condemned Mr. Jabril's threat to carry out the death threat issued by Iran's religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, against the British novelist Salman Rushdie. At the time, the State Department called on the Syrian Government to ''take appropriate action to ensure that the P.F.L.P.-G.C. does not follow through on this threat.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/27/world/white-house-plans-to-aid-poland-through-imf.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1989-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "White House Plans to Aid Poland Through I.M.F.", "print_headline": "White House Plans to Aid Poland Through I.M.F.", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration is working on a new ''package of support'' for Poland that relies strongly on the International Monetary Fund to channel money to the new Government in Warsaw as part of a major multilateral effort, White House officials said. **********In agreeing with plans by the International Monetary Fund to expand its role in Eastern Europe, the Administration has apparently committed itself to more ambitious aid to Poland than the direct assistance previously proposed by the White House. The new idea for aid through multilateral institutions was discussed today by the National Security Council, officials said. **********Administration officials say there could be a substantial difference between direct aid from Washington to Warsaw - which some Democrats have criticized as paltry - and international aid provided by the I.M.F. But they could not say exactly how much the fund might actually offer. **********The Administration has been under pressure to help the Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Solidarity supporter who is the head of the first Government in the Eastern bloc not led by Communists. Mr. Mazowiecki took charge of a nation reeling from a deteriorating economy that is crippled by numerous problems, including obsolete industries, consumer-goods shortages, and a staggering foreign debt. 'More Clout' in New Approach **********President Bush plans to address the fund on Wednesday morning, and State Department officials said he might use the forum to generally endorse an I.M.F. aid package to the economically desperate Polish Government. But they said he was not likely to offer details of the new package in the speech. **********Officials said Mr. Bush and his Administration were now convinced that the most effective political, diplomatic and economic vehicle for aid to Poland is not a nation-to-nation approach but an international program that would involve Western donors and Japan. That applies to Hungary as well, they said. **********Such an approach, the officials said, would carry specific conditions, like calling for a reduction in inflation, cuts in the budget deficit, a slower growth in the money supply and a competitive exchange rate. **********Administration officials also said aid through the fund provides ''more clout'' and ''international discipline'' than bilateral aid. The United States is the largest lender to the I.M.F., providing about 18 percent of the organization's money. Democrats Fault Direct-Aid Plan **********Administration officials said the United States, by working through the fund, can better insure that Poland's Government will take steps needed to restructure the economy. Administration officials assert that a preference for a multilateral approach does not represent a change in policy. Nor, they said, would it circumvent Washington's concerns that American aid would permit Poland to postpone the fundamental economic changes that American officials consider crucial to rebuilding Poland's economy. **********In political terms, the Administration could use aid through the I.M.F. to counter Democratic criticisms that Mr. Bush's nation-to-nation direct-aid program is paltry. A ranking White House official indicated that more aid to Poland was likely in some form, given the more than $1.2 billion in aid over three years proposed by Democrats, as compared with $146 million proposed by Mr. Bush. **********Polish officials have told the I.M.F. that Poland is seeking $700 million a year over the next three years from the fund. **********Perhaps most significant, the American contribution to agencies like the fund is not an outlay in budget terms, so it does not contribute to the deficit. Essentially, the funds are United States reserves that are made available to the fund but are always at the disposal of the United States if it wants the money returned. Expanded I.M.F Role in Poland **********''The U.S. does not want to spend budgetary resources in Eastern Europe,'' said Richard Feinberg, executive vice president of the Overseas Development Council, a leading economic-policy research organization. ''That's the beauty of the multilateral agencies. It enables us to participate in lending to Eastern Europe, but only paying less than 20 percent of the bill.'' **********Officials at the I.M.F. meeting in Washington said Monday that the fund is likely to agree by the end of the year to increase its resources as much as 67 percent, or $80 billion. That would be used, in part, to play an expanded role in Poland as well as Hungary, Yugoslavia and Rumania - the four Eastern European nations that are members of the fund. The Soviet Union is not a member of the fund. **********I.M.F. and Administration officials said it was virutally impossible to calculate how much Poland would receive if the agency increases its resourtces - although the $700-million-a-year figure over three years was a ''starting point,'' said one official. **********Economists and former Administration aides say that international agencies, like the World Bank and I.M.F., are the most viable way of lending abroad, and that the White House strategy is a sensible one. Avoiding U.S Budget Process **********''There's the simple point of financial leverage - by operating through the I.M.F. where the U.S. is a large capital holder, more money can flow into Poland than by operating through the U.S. budget process,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company, and former chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget in the President Ronald Reagan's first term. ''There's another agenda here too. The Administration wants the I.M.F. to guide Poland's economic development. They also want the I.M.F.'s monitoring.'' **********Meanwhile, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz has called on Western governments to provide a $1 billion ''stabilisation loan'' to back a tough anti-inflation program in his country and build up its international reserves. **********Western officials said today that Mr. Balcerowicz, in a series of talks with finance ministers from major industrial nations over the last days, had set out an ambitious timetable to transform Poland's crippled economy into the free-market mold."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/04/business/europe-cites-us-barriers-to-trading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 381, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Cites U.S. Barriers To Trading", "print_headline": "Europe Cites U.S. Barriers To Trading", "body_text": " **********The European Community's executive branch today released its 1989 report on trade barriers imposed by the United States, singling out 42 regulations and trade practices that it said impede imports from the 12 community nations. **********The barriers include quantitative restrictions, export subsidies, customs barriers, public procurement policies, countervailing duties, anti-dumping procedures and tax policies, the report by the European Commission said. **********The United States released its report last Friday on foreign trade practices that it considers unfair. **********The commission's spokesman, Claus Ehlermann, said the timing of the release of the report was not linked to the United States report, which listed Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, the European Community and India as the worst offenders of free trade.

Agricultural protection is a highly sensitive political issue in all countries. **********But American officials say the formula offers the best hope for success in the negotiations. The Least Distortion **********Washington is seeking the change because tariffs are generally acknowledged to be the import barrier that distorts free trade the least. Tariffs establish a link between domestic and world market prices and are more likely to allow competition. **********Washington has been weighing the new strategy for months and recently circulated the plan among foreign governments.

But the community's commissioner for agriculture, Ray MacSharry of Ireland, has already expressed opposition to the idea. **********Japan is not expected to be enthusiastic about the proposal either, as Tokyo would then have to end its ban on imports of rice, a national staple. To encourage domestic rice production, Japan keeps its rice prices up to 10 times higher than the world level. Cautious Support **********The proposal has the cautious support of the American farm community, although producers in highly protected sectors, like peanuts, sugar and dairy products, are nervous about it, farm industry representatives said. **********The initiative, set forth in a discussion paper, represents efforts by the Bush Administration to increase momentum of the so-called Uruguay Round of trade reform talks. The talks involve more than 100 countries meeting under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade body. **********Washington has been weighing the tariff conversion idea for some months but has only now incorporated the plan into its formal negotiating position. **********The move follows an agreement by trade ministers who met in Geneva in April to seek ''substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection.'' **********That agreement prevented a collapse of the current round of trade talks. The talks were threatened by the failure of the United States and the European Community to agree on a framework for negotiations. **********The Uruguay Round of talks also have on the agenda the liberalization of barriers to banking, construction, transportation, tourism and telecommunications. The talks are also trying to provide stronger protection for patents, trademarks and copyrights, and improved procedures for settling trade disputes. **********The community keeps farm prices high, employing a levy system that prevents most food imports from entering Europe at prices below those prevailing inside the bloc. **********''In general terms, most American farmers feel that on a level playing field they can compete with other countries, but skepticism will remain among those who fear that other countries will not go as far as the United States,'' said Paul A. Drazek, international trade specialist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Brady's remarks today to the Brookings Institution and the Bretton Woods Committee conference on third-world debt: **********Since 1982 the world community has endeavored to come to terms with international debt. In 1985 we paused and took stock of our progress in addressing the problem. As a result of that review, together we brought forth a new strategy, centered on economic growth. This still makes sense. However, it is appropriate that now, almost four years later, we again take stock. **********Thus in recent months we have undertaken to look afresh at the international debt situation. The purpose was to discover what progress has been made; to see where we as a community of nations have succeeded and where we have not. And, where our success has not met our expectations, to understand why we have not achieved our goals. Consulted Widely **********We have studied in depth, we have consulted widely - seeking and taking into account the views of debtor nations, multilateral institutions, commercial banks and legislatures. We have also consulted closely with Japan and other industrial countries in order to begin to lay the basis for a common approach to the debt problem by the creditor countries. **********Let me share with you the results of our reassessment as part of the ongoing process of international collaboration. I would hope that the ideas and suggestions I put forth here will provide a basis for a concerted effort by the international community to reinvigorate a process that has become debt-weary. However, we must strengthen the process without stopping it. As we move ahead with these ideas in the weeks ahead, it is important to continue working on individual debt problems.  * **********However, despite the accomplishments to date, we must acknowledge that serious problems and impediments to a successful resolution of the debt crisis remain. Clearly, in many of the major debtor nations, growth has not been sufficient. Nor has the level of economic policy reform been adequate. Capital flight has drained resources from debtor nations' economies. Inflation Not Under Control **********Meanwhile, neither investment nor domestic savings has shown much improvement. In many cases, inflation has not been brought under control. Commercial bank lending has not always been timely. The force of these circumstances has overshadowed the progress achieved. Despite progress, prosperity remains, for many, out of reach. **********Other pressures also exist. The multilateral institutons and the Paris club have made up a portion of the shortfall in finance. Commercial bank exposure to the major debtors since 1985 has declined slightly, while the exposure of the international institutions has increased sharply. If this trend were to continue, it could lead to a situation in which the debt problem would be transferred largely to the international institutions, weakening their financial position.  * **********In considering next steps, a few key points should be kept in mind: **********First, obviously, financial resources are scarce. Can they be used more effectively? **********Second, we must recognize that reversing capital flight offers a major opportunity, since in many cases flight capital is larger than outstanding debt. **********Third, there is no substitute for sound policies. **********Fourth, we must maintain the important role of the international financial institutions and preserve their financial integrity. **********Fifth, we should encourage debt and debt service reduction on a voluntary basis, while recognizing the importance of continued new lending. This should provide an important step back to the free markets, where funds abound and transactions are enacted in days, not months. **********Finally, we must draw together these elements to provide debtor countries with greater hope for the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/28/business/business-digest-997889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********ECONOMY  The huge agency set up to manage the assets of failed savings associations is getting entangled in disputes between banking regulators and Administration officials charged with overseeing them.

The value of the average money manager's stock portfolio climbed 17.8 percent in 1988, according to C.D.A. Investment Technologies. For the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 16.4 percent. **********It is hard to pinpoint exactly why the independent firms, which manage multimillion-dollar accounts for pension funds and other large institutions, beat the index last year. One theory holds that in years when stocks post strong gains, managers should do even better, said Robert A. Levy, president of C.D.A., because their portfolios are more volatile than the overall market, rising and falling more sharply. **********The 1988 results do not offer any simple investment lessons since the firms that made the top of the list represent a variety of strategies. Some use a value approach, for instance, and some invest in the ''small'' stocks with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion. Some excelled with relatively small amounts of money, while other firms produced superior results with billions of dollars under their control. **********Over the long term, the average independent money manger's relative performance remains unimpressive. The compound annual rate of return for the average stock manager over five years was 13.6 percent, less than the 15.2 percent average annual gain of the S.&P. 500. Over 10 years, the average manager returned 16.4 percent a year, while the index had an average annual gain of 16.3 percent. **********Clients of the average firm are obviously disappointed because, after subtracting for fees, they could have got the same return or better with index funds, passively managed portfolios designed to mirror the performance of an index. **********The weak long-term performance figures explain in part why pension fund officials have invested almost $200 billion in the index funds, a trend market experts predict will continue through 1989. **********''They don't have anything to be proud about,'' Mr. Levy said of the independent managers. **********C.D.A. tracks 420 independent money management firms - those that are not affiliated with banks or insurance companies. While the C.D.A. rankings are considered an important industry yardstick, they are not an exact measure of total performance. The technique the firm uses to calculate returns for each quarter is based on the assumption that the firms hold their stocks for the whole quarter. Also, the firm measures only stock returns and does not take into account the cash or bonds held in a portfolio. **********Thus, when the firms park part of their clients' accounts in bonds or such short-term instruments as Treasury bills, the managers' total returns may be even lower than the equity-only results that C.D.A. calculates. The results are also calculated without subtracting management fees and transaction costs. **********For longer periods of three and five years, many of the best-performing managers were the so-called value managers, like Gamco Investors of New York, headed by Mario Gabelli, which ranked sixth in 1988, third for the three years and first for the five years. Value investors look for companies that have records of stong cash flow and whose stocks sell at prices below their book value, defined as a company's assets minus its liabilities. **********In the last five years this valuation approach - which is also one favored by many takeover and leveraged buyout concerns - has proved more successful than the growth stock approach, where managers make their choices on the basis of a company's expected earnings. **********The stock portfolios at the best-performing firm, Donald Smith & Company, were up 55.5 percent. The firm buys stocks that sell at a low price in relation to their book value, said Donald Smith, president of the Paramus, N.J., firm, which manages $1 billion for such institutional clients as Harvard University and the State of Virginia pension fund. **********Mr. Smith had good luck with stocks that had fallen in value because investors did not think the company's management would be able to turn them around. Among them were BankAmerica, up 156 percent for the year; Middle South Utilities, up 94 percent, and Long Island Lighting, up 79 percent. **********In addition, Mr. Smith's analysis led him to buy many of the so-called cyclical stocks, such as General Motors, Bethlehem Steel and Inland Steel. ''One year ago, people hated these stocks,'' he said. **********In contrast, last year's second-best performing firm achieved its record with much less money and by investing in stocks of much smaller companies. The $8 million equity portfolio managed by First Wilshire Securities in Los Angeles climbed 49.7 percent. The firm tries to buy shares of companies before they are discovered by such large investors as mutual funds, said Fred L. Astman, the chairman. **********First Wilshire looks for companies that have little debt, an earnings growth rate higher than the market average and a price-earnings ratio lower than the market average. Among the stocks in the firm's portfolio last year were Nature's Sunshine Products, which produces vitamins, herbs and water purifiers; Shopsmith, a specialty retailer of woodworking tools; Aspen Ribbons, which dominates the market in ribbons for computer printers, and United Tote, which supplies the computerized wagering boards at race tracks. **********The portfolio managers at Moran Asset Management, the third-best-performing firm, invest in stocks of companies that have strong cash flows and a dominant position in their particular market, said Frederick A. Moran, president of the Greenwich, Conn., brokerage and advisory firm. **********As a result of this strategy, Moran owned stocks of cable television operators, independent telphone companies and companies involved in cellular telephones. Some of the firm's large holdings were Century Telephone Enterprises, LIN Broadcasting and Telephone and Data Systems. **********Mr. Moran continues to own these stocks because he believes that the future for cable and cellular telephone companies is so strong. Indeed, almost half of the 45 stocks that are in his clients' accounts are cable or cellular phone companies. In both industries, companies have little or no competition in their local areas and the expected growth rate for these services continues to be strong, he said. **********The fund managers at Ariel Capital Management in Chicago achieved returns of 40.4 percent last year by investing in smaller companies that trade over the counter or on the American Stock Exchange. They try to buy stocks that dominate their industries and sell at a price/earnings ratio of less than 11, said John W. Rogers, the firm's founder and president. Ariel avoids stocks of companies that have volatile earnings. ''We hate change,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''We want solid, consistent earnings.'' **********The firm invests $675 million for pension fund clients and from its mutual fund customers. Last year, the firm's portfolios benefited from takeovers and rumors of acquisitions. The firm owns shares of the John O. Butler Company and Specialty Equipment, which were both acquired in 1988. In addition, Ariel held shares of Western Publishing and Caesars World, which were the objects of takeover rumors. **********Two of Mr. Rogers's current favorites are Sealright, which makes the cardboard packages for premium ice cream, and Healthco International, the largest domestic distributor of dental products."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/business/dividend-meetings-108889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of July 16, 1989:          MONDAY        Dana Corp   Jorgensen Earle M Co Del        Eastern Utils Assoc   Lilly Eli & Co        Goodrich B F Co        TUESDAY        AR Corp   Learonal Inc        Aristech Chem Corp   Lehman Corp        Banc One Corp   Loews Corp        Cincinnati Milacron Inc   Mellon Bk Corp        Citicorp   Morgan Stanley Group Inc        FGIC Corp   Pope & Talbot Inc        Federal Natl Mtg Assn   Public Svc Enterprise Inc        Honeywell Inc   Scott Paper Co        ICM Ppty Invs Inc   Southern Ind Gas & Elec Co        Interpublic Group Cos Inc   VF Corp        K Mart Corp        WEDNESDAY        Alberto-Culver Co   Kansas Pwr & Lt Co        Avnet Inc   Midwest Energy Co        Barnes Group Inc   Mortgage & Realty Tr        Cincinnati Gas & Elec Co   Republic NY Corp        Citytrust Bancorp Inc   St Joseph Lt & Pwr Co        Clorox Co   Sherwin Williams Co        Dun & Bradstreet Corp   Southern Co        Fleet Norstar Finl Grp Inc   Southwest Airls Co        Gencorp Inc   Sovran Finl Corp        IBP Inc   Zero Corp        THURSDAY        Amer Health Pptys Inc   Jepson Corp        Arch-Daniels-Mdlnd Co   Kollmorgan Corp        Ashland Oil Inc   Lomas Finl Corp        Bearings Inc Del   Lone Star Inds Inc        Birmingham Stl Corp   Oneok Inc        Black & Decker Corp   Outboard Marine Corp        Cent & South West Corp   Owens & Minor Inc        Eastern Enterprises   PPG Inds Inc        Grumman Corp   Standard Fed Bk Troy Mich        Halliburton Co   Sundstrand Corp        Health Care Ppty Invs Inc   Thomas Inds Inc        Hilton Hotels Corp   Time Inc        Interstate Pwr Co   Tultex Corp        FRIDAY        Commun Satelite Corp   Sizeler Ppty Invs Inc        Pinnacle West Cap Corp   Tyler Corp"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Sandals, an operator of resorts in Jamaica, to the William Cook Agency, with a budget of $5 million. *********** Vittel Imports USA to Campbell & Wagman, Los Angeles, for its mineral water."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/20/world/afghan-aide-takes-on-a-thankless-task.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1989-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Afghan Aide Takes On a Thankless Task", "print_headline": "Afghan Aide Takes On a Thankless Task", "body_text": " **********In a wing of the presidential palace here, no more than a slingshot's range from the spot where rivals smothered one of the country's previous Marxist leaders with a pillow, a former tea merchant spends most of his time these days trying to get a fresh hearing for what has been one of the most ruthless governments in Asia. **********To reach Abdul Rahim Hatif, who became a Vice President of Afghanistan last year, visitors have to pass through multiple rings of security, including one where any Afghan has to leave his watch, his ballpoint pen and even, in the case of one Government guide today, his toothbrush. **********Mr. Hatif works down the corridor from the heavily guarded suite of the Kabul Government's leader, President Najibullah, whose two predecessors as leader of the Communist party were murdered and a third dispatched to exile in the Soviet Union. Unenviable Task **********With a record like that, and nine years of war that were provoked by the Soviet decision to send troops to insure the survival of the Communist Government in 1979, it is an ambitious man who takes on the task of trying to persuade the world that Kabul's rulers have changed. **********But that is the task of Mr. Hatif, who had made a modest fortune with his tea business in Kandahar when he took on the chairmanship of something called the National Reconciliation Council, a body charged with ending the war by persuading the Government's guerrilla opponents to join in a coalition. **********In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Hatif appealed to the United States to step back from the policy of arming the Muslim fighters known as the mujahedeen and to consider whether the Afghan Government does not deserve at least a hearing. **********At a time when Kabul's forces and the guerrillas are engaged in the most savage battle of the war, at the old, walled city of Jalalabad, Mr. Hatif said, the Bush Administration should ask itself whether it wants to perpetuate a ''fratricidal, endless war'' or to turn to exploring possibilities of peace. **********His appeal to the United States came as the Administration is said to be considering breaking relations with Kabul and appointing a special ambassador to the guerrillas' transitional government in exile. **********Over cups of green tea, in an office looking out at the stone walls of the palace occupied until 1973 by Afghanistan's kings, Mr, Hatif said the Jalalabad battle proved that neither the government nor the rebels were likely to win the war without years of fighting. **********And he argued that the United States, having originally committed its support to the guerrillas because of the involvement here of more than 100,000 Soviet troops, should accept that with the Soviet Army gone, ''the only reason'' for continuing the war has vanished. **********Saying that thousands had died in Jalalabad since the battle began two weeks ago, the Vice President went on: ''On both sides, our brothers are falling, and we are not proud of it. And we cannot see why this bloodshed should continue at the behest of an alien power, when it is destroying everything that has been achieved here in the past 50 years.'' He paused and added: ''We would hope that all foreign powers would realize that we cannot solve the problems we confront here by continuing with the conflict that we have experienced for the past 12 years.'' From Non-Party Group **********The 63-year-old Mr. Hatif, who polished his English listening to the Voice of America, belongs to a group of so-called ''non-party'' officials recruited into the Government by Mr. Najibullah since he embarked on his reconciliation policy two years ago. **********Although Kabul's leader recently dismissed a number of ministers from the non-party group, including the Prime Minister, Hassan Sharq, Mr. Hatif said that 7 of the 25 members in the current Government were not members of the ruling party, and had joined the administration because, like him, they wanted to end the war. **********The reconciliation policy has met with widespread skepticism, not least in the month since the last Soviet troops were withdrawn. Mr. Najibullah, apparently nervous at the possibility of an uprising in Kabul and other cities that his Government controls, imposed a state of emergency under which many of the rights written into a new 1987 Constitution were suspended. **********The Pul-i-Charki prison in Kabul continues to house large numbers of political prisoners and detainees, and house-to-house searches in the last three weeks have increased the prison population. Further Criticism Heard **********Along with this, the authorities continue to use battle tactics that have drawn bitter criticism from international human rights groups, including the high-altitude bombing of suspected rebel positions that has sometimes included areas on the fringes of cities and towns. By some estimates, 1.2 million people, 9 percent of the prewar poulation, have been killed in the years of fighting, and 5.5 million, more than a third of the 15 million poeple said to have living in the country before 1979, have fled to refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. **********The Vice President, who recently returned from defending the Government's human rights record at a conference in Switzerland, offered only a mild defense of the regime's performance before 1986, when the reconciliation policy was proclaimed. But he insisted that real change has come since and that the policy is sincere. Willingness to Be Flexible **********''This policy of Afghanistan is unchangeable,'' he said. ''We have shown our readiness to broaden the basis of our state and Government.''

Trump said yesterday that he had asked Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, to reduce sharply the price of the Eastern Airlines shuttle, which Mr. Trump agreed in October to buy for $365 million. **********Eastern responded by putting its Washington-New York-Boston shuttle, one of its prized assets, on the auction block again. **********Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he wanted the shuttle price reduced by from $125 million to $165 million because its value had ''been devastated'' by Eastern's loss of market share and the two-week-old strike by its machinists. The pilots' union has honored the machinists' picket lines. Strike at Continental **********On a separate front, the flight attendants' union at Continental Airlines, which is also owned by Texas Air, struck yesterday. **********Union leaders said the strike had been called to get Continental's management to negotiate a new contract and was not related to the Eastern strike. There was little apparent disruption of Continental flights. **********When Eastern filed for bankrutpcy protection earlier this month, Mr. Lorenzo and the airline's executives said the sale of the shuttle was important in carrying out their plan to increase Eastern's cash and gradually rebuild the line's operations. **********Eastern sent Mr. Trump a letter yesterday that said it planned to solicit offers from other parties. 'Substantial Unsolicited Offers' **********''You should know that we have recently received substantial unsolicited offers from other parties, including one just this morning,'' Barry P. Simon, a senior vice president of Eastern, wrote to the New York real estate developer. ''You are welcome, of course, to make any offer you feel appropriate.'' **********Mr. Trump said in the interview that ''the asset has been devastated by the events of the last couple of weeks.'' At one point during the strike, Eastern slashed shuttle fares to as low as $12. When it returned the fares to previous levels, passenger volume dropped off again, to far below normal. **********Eastern's rival on the shuttle routes, Pan American World Airways, has had much heavier traffic. Many business passengers who had been loyal to Eastern have apparently switched to Pan Am. **********As the maneuvering between the airlines continued, Eastern said yesterday that travelers on a scheduled Eastern shuttle flight that departed more than five minutes late would get their money back. **********Mr. Trump said in a letter to Mr. Lorenzo that ''we are in a position to close this deal quickly, before the shuttle operations become worse, perhaps irrevocably so, and to provide Eastern with the cash infusion which it so desperately needs.'' Interest by Other Bidders **********Helane Becker, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, said yesterday that even if the sale should fall through, other airlines would step in to make a bid for the shuttle, which is considered to be one of the most valuable assets of Eastern. An industry source said that USAir and American Airlines had expressed interest in bidding for the shuttle, Mr. Lorenzo has about $200 million in cash to fall back on even without the shuttle sale. He said after the bankruptcy filing that he was prepared to carry through his plan of gradually restoring the airline at lower labor costs, even if the shuttle deal fell through. **********Phil Bakes, the president of Eastern, estimated yesterday that the airline had reduced its cash needs to $800,000 to $900,000 a day, about a fourth of what they had been before the bankruptcy filing. With that loss level, Eastern could continue operations for months even if the shuttle deal was not closed, analysts said. **********Mr. Bakes said Eastern was contemplating selling more airplanes. He added that the airline had received numerous inquiries since it began advertising for pilots. He estimated, however, that it would take six to eight weeks to train pilots in Eastern procedures so that the earliest that the line could begin to use them would be in May. Court Approval Needed **********Any sale of the shuttle would have to be approved by the Federal bankruptcy court in New York, which would be under pressure from creditors and stockholders to approve a sale at a good price. **********A sale to Mr. Trump would help Mr. Lorenzo because most of the approvals and certificates needed were finished or near completion. Another advantage of dealing with Mr. Trump is that there are no antitrust problems since he does not have any airline holdings. **********The Justice Department has said that it plans to be stricter in its reviews of airline asset acquisitions than the Department of Transportation, which held the authority to make antitrust reviews until Jan. 1. **********Continental's flight attendants have been working without a contract since 1983, when Mr. Lorenzo put the carrier under the protection of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, abrogated union contracts and rehired many employees at lower wages and benefits, a strategy he is seeking to use at Eastern."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/07/business/fraud-cited-in-penny-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1989-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 548, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fraud Cited In Penny Stocks", "print_headline": "Fraud Cited In Penny Stocks", "body_text": " **********Traders of penny stocks are losing an estimated $2 billion a year through widespread fraud in the market of the low-priced securities, a report issued today by a group of state securities regulators said. **********The report calls penny stock fraud ''the No. 1 threat of fraud and abuse facing small investors in the United States,'' and says that the ability of legitimate small businesses to raise capital has been hampered by ''unscrupulous promoters'' with long records of past securities law violations, and in some cases, ties to organized crime. **********The study was prepared for Congress by the North American Securities Administrators Association, a Washington-based group. It was released today in anticipation of hearings scheduled for Thursday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance on penny stock fraud.

It says that excluding fraud, 70 percent of the investors lose money in penny stocks, and with fraud, 90 percent lose all or part of their investment. **********''A penny stock investor is the stock market's equivalent of someone stumbling down a dark alley in a crime-ridden inner city,'' the report says. **********Penny stocks are now traded by 325 firms with offices in 29 states.

Earlier this year, the Denver-based company settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had manipulated prices involving penny stocks in 1986 and 1987. **********The report urges Congress to take several actions to stem the abuse of the penny stock market, primarily by requiring brokers to disclose more information to customers. 'Pink Sheets' **********At the moment, information about the price of stocks is not published in newspapers or listed on computers, allowing for greater opportunity for price manipulation. The shares of penny stocks are listed in books known as ''pink sheets,'' which are no more than listings of 13,000 securities. **********The report also recommends that Congress allow the S.E.C. to pay bounties for information to assist in cases involving penny stock fraud. It also endorses pending legislation to combat telemarketing fraud. **********In addition, the document calls for Congress to ban to all offerings in which the company has no stated business plan or assets - a ''blank check'' offering.

The boulevard has evolved into an automotive row with the largest concentration of dealerships in New York City. Now Mr. Koeppel has a new competitor-neighbor - a cluster of three General Motors dealers who opened showrooms last month. **********Currently 18 dealerships, which sell lines ranging from Hyundai, the low-priced Korean import, to luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz, are doing business on a mile-long stretch of the boulevard between 35th Street and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. **********While long-established dealers like the Koeppels are found on Northern Boulevard, many dealers have set up shop there in the last six years. Some were priced out of their space elsewhere in Queens and in Manhattan. **********Although new dealerships dominate the boulevard, the strip has also become a magnet for automobile service businesses - among them body shops, tire stores, upholsterers, glass suppliers and loan offices. **********''Long Island City has become such an important location that dealers looking to serve the New York City market feel they have to be there,'' said Mark Schienberg, executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. ''We get calls every day from dealers who want space on that street.'' **********To save time and money, some dealers have moved into old factories or warehouses, meeting their special design needs by punching out walls and installing plate glass windows. **********The showrooms that opened last month serve Bloom Pontiac, Bayer Cadillac and Major Chevrolet. They occupy adjacent buildings constructed and leased to them by the General Motors Corporation, which makes the cars they sell. The new showrooms are on 8.5 acres between 43d and 45th Streets that G.M. bought in the early 1980's before Long Island City property values soared. **********Bayer Cadillac relocated from another showroom on Northern Boulevard, and Major Chevrolet moved from Steinway Street. Bloom Pontiac is expanding the Pontiac line. **********''There is no Pontiac dealership in Manhattan,'' said Eli Bloom, president of Bloom Pontiac, who also owns a Pontiac dealership in the Maspeth section of Queens. ''Until we opened, there had not been a Pontiac dealership on the north shore of Queens for more than eight years. By not being here, we were giving up a lot to the competition.'' **********G.M. built nearly identical setups for each dealer. Each of the 9,000-square-foot showrooms has glass-walled display space in front. **********''The showrooms are great,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''But what really makes these facilties special is the extra room. With more than two acres of property for each of us, we have space for a large inventory and for customer parking. That's a real luxury in any location in the city.'' **********General Motors is also building a service center on a seven-acre parcel south of Northern boulevard on 43d Street and Skillman Avenue. **********According to dealers and industry analysts, G.M.'s build-to-lease program is a strategy that other auto makers might be forced to follow. **********''Rents are becoming prohibitive in some areas,'' said Mr. Schienberg of the dealers' association. ''But the average dealer does not have the margin of profit that gives him the room to finance the cost of buying or starting a dealership and building a showroom. Manufacturers who want to hold their share of the market have to become involved in the real estate concerns of their dealers, even if it means absorbing some costs.'' **********The dealers flocking to Northern Boulevard may have found only a temporary haven from high costs. **********According to Gail Roseman, an executive vice president of the Shalom & Zuckerbrot Realty Corporation, a Long Island City real estate brokerage concern, any space user negotiating to buy or lease land on Northern Boulevard is likely to pay twice as much today as five years ago. **********''Dealers with leases that are more than five years old probably got in for about $5 to $6 a square foot,'' she said. ''Today new tenants pay between $8 to $12 a foot, depending on the location and condition of the property.'' **********She attributed the steep rise in rents not only to the success of the boulevard as an automotive center but also to rising values throughout Long Island City. **********''We may soon reach the point where the real estate is more valuable than the dealership,'' said Daniel Koeppel. He and his brother, Howard, own three Long Island City showrooms. In the past they had showrooms on leased land. But now, they insist, ownership is essential to survival. They recently bought a 52,000-square-foot property on Northern Boulevard at Steinway Street. **********''Real estate is not what we do,'' Daniel Koeppel said.

Two advocates of liberalization, Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth and Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, complete the new leadership. **********The action by the party's Central Committee follows several months during which the power of Mr. Grosz has been increasingly contested by leaders more firmly committed to political and economic change. But rumors that the Central Committee would remove him from the leadership proved untrue. **********The widening of power was given impetus by Mr. Grosz's retreats from policies that he had affirmed until the drive for change made such positions untenable. He has been overruled on his opposition to a multiparty system and to a multibillion-dollar hydroelectric dam project. Attempt to Avoid a Split **********The Central Committee apparently acted to avoid a party split before the coming party congress, planned for Oct. 7. The collective leadership's functions were not defined, but membership clearly confers on Mr. Grosz's chief rivals positions that recognize their special status. **********Asked on television tonight what role the presidency would play in relation to the normally great power of the General Secretary, a party spokesman, Laszlo Major, said that a president was a president and evaded any definition. A news conference called for Monday might shed light on the issue. **********The Hungarian party created the post of president for the first time last year. It named Janos Kadar, General Secretary since 1956, to the position after a group including Mr. Grosz, Mr. Nyers and Mr. Pozsgay succeeded in replacing the longtime leader with Mr. Grosz. **********Mr. Kadar never sought to give content to the undefined functions of the presidency. Last spring, when the offensive by advocates of change accelerated, Mr. Grosz sought to deflect pressure aimed at him by casting his predecessor into disgrace. He ousted Mr. Kadar from the presidency and the Central Committee. **********Mr. Grosz proved his continuing power within the party machine when Mr. Major announced today that only three of 90 speakers during the two-day Central Committee session had called for his resignation. However, the present Central Committee has not undergone change that would align it more fully with tendencies toward a more open and democratic approach and is thought to be made up largely of faithful followers of whoever the leader might be. **********Party officials and other knowledgeable Hungarians have for several months reported indications of a below-the-surface power struggle, in which Mr. Nyers and Mr. Pozsgay have clearly advocated more change than has Mr. Grosz. However, the two liberal Politburo members are known not to be operating jointly and are said not to be friends. Nyers May Lead Transition **********Mr. Pozsgay is thought to be more ambitious, whereas Mr. Nyers, an economist, has long been viewed as a potential transitional leader. **********Mr. Nyers devised Hungary's economic changes in the late 1960's but was dropped from power when, after the Prague Spring of 1968, Leonid I. Brezhnev called a halt to all liberalization efforts in the Soviet camp. Mr. Nyers returned to academic work and was not called back to political power until Mr. Kadar's ouster. **********In an interview last month, Mr. Pozsgay told The New York Times that if he were given a choice between leading the party and becoming President of the nation, he would prefer the presidency. Hungarians who have discussed his future with him have reported that Mr. Pozsgay would like to see the presently ceremonial presidency strengthened to resemble the post held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. A Recent Loss of Prestige **********Mr. Grosz is thought to have suffered the most serious loss of prestige on June 16, the day Hungarians, with official permission, gave an impressive reburial with national honors to Imre Nagy, the Prime Minister executed in 1958 for having led the 1956 uprising, and four associates sentenced to death with him. **********The nine hours of public ceremonies in the center of Budapest and at the cemetery amounted to a full rehabilitation of Mr. Nagy. Mr. Grosz had earlier ruled out this restitution of honor and changed his position only so far as to say that a judicial review was taking place. Events then overcame him. **********Mr. Pozsgay and Mr. Nemeth, however, placed wreaths at Mr. Nagy's coffin and then joined those who stood in silent vigil there. The gesture, telecast live throughout the country, was seen as underlining Mr. Grosz's absence and waning hold on the national leadership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/18/world/mozambican-government-ready-to-start-meeting-with-guerrillas.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1989-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 555, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mozambican Government Ready To Start Meeting With Guerrillas", "print_headline": "Mozambican Government Ready To Start Meeting With Guerrillas", "body_text": " **********The President of Mozambique acknowledged today that Mozambican church leaders and a Government delegation were prepared to meet with representatives of the Government's guerrilla opponents. **********The President, Joaquim Chissano, speaking at a news conference in Maputo, his country's capital, did not specifically say that the Government was ready to negotiate with the Mozambican National Resistance, the guerrilla group known as Renamo. But he said he had sent a 12-point ''position paper'' to the rebels, including a call for the guerrillas to renounce violence, and was awaiting a response. **********The Renamo delegation failed to arrive for a scheduled session last week, Mr. Chissano said, according to accounts from diplomats in Maputo. But he said the government delegation and the church leaders, acting as intermediaries, still hoped for a meeting in the next few days. Kenyan President to Help **********Mr. Chissano did not elaborate on the Government proposal to the rebels. But he said President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, acting as a peace broker, would fly to Maputo in the next three days to clarify the next steps. **********A Western diplomat described Mr. Chissano's statements as a tremendous turnaround in that the President publicly stated his willingness to reach a settlement in the war, which has been going on since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. **********Mr. Chissano had previously offered amnesty to the rebels, who were branded in a State Department report last year as among the most brutal in the world. But Western diplomats said they had impressed upon Mr. Chissano that amnesty would not be enough to induce the rebels to end their violence, which has helped reduce Mozambique to one of the world's poorest countries and killed 100,000 people since 1984. **********The President's statements today coincided with increased diplomatic activity in southern Africa to end the war and capitalize on a mood for peace created by the cease-fire agreement between the Angolan Government and rebel forces last month. **********During a visit to Maputo several days ago, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman Cohen, said Washington was accepting Mr. Chissano's invitation to be helpful in settling the war.

In 1984, South Africa and Mozambique signed a nonaggression pact, but South African support for the rebels continued. Last September, South Africa again promised it would not support Renamo, a pledge that diplomats say has been better kept, but not entirely. **********Diplomats said that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Mr. de Klerk, during his visit to London last month, that the South Africans must stop all assistance to Renamo.

Most classical music stations are profitable, they said, but not profitable enough for takeover artists. **********Almost immediately, however, another commercial Los Angeles station - jazz station KKGO - began presenting classical music eight hours a day. By January, KKGO will play only classical music on its FM station and jazz on its AM station. **********And during the last decade, on the other side of the continent, Marlin Broadcasting Inc. in Boston has bought unprofitable classical music stations in three large markets and made them profitable. Vulnerable Stations **********Most classical music stations are profitable. But because there are a limited number of radio licenses, those stations are vulnerable to buyers looking to enter established markets. KFAC was bought in 1986 for $34 million and was sold three years later for $55 million. **********At those prices, the classical format, which reaches an average of just 1.5 percent of listeners nationwide and rarely exceeds 3 percent, is very likely to be dropped in favor of one that will bring in more listeners and advertising dollars. Once buyers have the license, they can broadcast in any format they wish. **********''The ultimate problem with classical stations in major markets is that they're worth more dead than alive,'' said James H. Duncan Jr., who publishes analyses of radio ratings, sales and growth. ''The successful classical stations are either already paid for or carry very low debt.'' More Cash Flow Needed **********KFAC had revenues in 1988 of $5 million to $6 million, with cash flow of $1.5 million to $2 million. The new owners, Evergreen Media Inc., will probably need to quadruple the cash flow to make the payments on the debt from the sale, Mr. Duncan said. **********Howard P. Tanger, president of Marlin, bristles at such figures. He bought his first commercial classical station, WTMI-FM in Miami, 10 years ago. It was unprofitable when he bought it, but it has posted profits ever since, as have his other two stations, WQRS-FM in Detroit and WFLN-FM in Philadelphia. **********''What we're seeing in the radio business is the same as in airlines and stores - leveraged buyouts,'' Mr. Tanger said. ''The problem is not the failure to achieve profits, but that someone has decided to come into a marketplace, and the price for doing that is so high they're forced to abandon the format.'' **********Mr. Tanger has made his stations profitable by lowering operating costs and by using many of the techniques of mass-market radio to attract younger listeners to the classicial music format. ''Our philosophy is to market them as aggressive, top-40 stations,'' he said. **********A similar move has occurred in New York, where two commercial classical music stations - WQXR, which is owned by The New York Times Company, and WNCN, which is owned by GAF Broadcasting - compete. The combined AM and FM arms of WQXR draw about 1.5 percent in the market; WNCN has about 1.3 percent, Mr. Duncan said. Different Tactics **********WQXR is New York's first classical music station, so WNCN has been using some tactics described by Mr. Tanger to differentiate itself, hiring announcers from rock stations and programming only the most popular works in the classicial repertory. **********''What we were doing was presenting as wide a variety of classical music as possible, in a warm, authoritative style,'' said Warren Bodow, the president of WQXR. ''But that skewed a little older than the market average. WNCN began to counter-program, and a segment of the audience, mostly younger, responded. We both have the most upscale audience any radio station can have, but now we have two different profiles.'' **********The cost of advertising on classical music stations has risen steadily, though it is lower than the more popular formats. Sam Michaelson, who has spent 14 years at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising as a buyer of time on radio stations, said spot advertising on WQXR and WNCN sells for $160 to $275 per minute; it can cost more than twice that amount on popular New York stations. Yet because the audience size is smaller, the rates commanded by the classical stations are premium. Chief Selling Point **********Indeed, the quality of the classical music audience is its chief selling point to advertisers. **********''Advertisers are learning to talk to the right people, not just to more people,'' said Peter J. Cleary, the president of Concert Music Broadcasting Inc., a 13-year-old company that represents only commercial classical music stations to advertisers. **********The number of commercial classical music station has remained the same for many years. For every station that relinquishes the format, another takes over. **********So Mr. Tanger of Marlin Broadcasting retains an optimistic view, and he has the numbers to back him up. He now produces a 45 percent operating profit margin on $10 million in revenues. He expects to be able to buy his next station without outside financing. ''It's not a dying format,'' he said. ''It's healthy and growing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/08/world/births-in-brazil-are-on-decline-easing-worries.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1989-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Births in Brazil Are on Decline, Easing Worries", "print_headline": "Births in Brazil Are on Decline, Easing Worries", "body_text": " **********In one generation, Brazil's fertility rate has been cut almost in half, and in the words of one expert, the country's ''population bomb has been deactivated.'' **********''Brazil is compressing 100 years of fertility decline into 20 years,'' said the expert, George Martine, a Canadian demographer who works in Brasilia. The fertility rate, 5.75 children per woman in 1970, has declined to about 3.2 today. **********Indeed, there are fewer Brazilian children under age 4 today than a decade ago. Over all, Brazil will continue to add to its current population of 145 million, but it will probably end this century with 170 million people - 50 million fewer than demographers predicted a decade ago. Contraception Spreads **********The sharp change in outlook, which surprised many planners, is attributed to a combination of factors: rapid spread of contraceptive devices, economic stagnation over the last decade and universal access to television. **********The dramatic drop in fertility rates in Brazil, Latin America's most populous country, has been accompanied by similar drops in Colombia and Mexico, countries that have strong, Government-led family-planning programs. **********''What distinguishes Brazil is the absence of any Government birth control policy,'' Mr. Martine said. ''Brazil has experienced the largest self-induced drop in human history.'' **********After initial hostility to family planning in the 1960's, Brazil's Government and the Roman Catholic Church here have largely maintained a laissez-faire attitude in recent years. **********On the reproductive plane, today's Brazil is a radically different country than the Brazil of the mid-1960's. In 1965, the ruling military encouraged big families, and only 5 percent of fertile married women used contraceptives. **********Today, two-thirds of married women use some form of contraception, according to Bemfam, Brazil's largest private family-planning agency.

There has been no parallel trend toward sterilization among Brazilian men, however. Of married men in Brazil, 0.8 percent have undergone sterilization. **********Seated on a wooden bench in a family-planning clinic here, Maria Izete Costa Marinha recounted a personal childbearing history that somewhat resembles Brazil's: Her mother had 12 children. She had three children. Her daughter wants to have two children. **********Napoleao Teixeira Leao Jr., a doctor at the family-planning clinic visited by Mrs. Costa, said Brazilian attitudes toward the sterilization of women had changed radically. **********''My father, who is also a gynecologist, tells me that in the 1960's a doctor who performed the operation was a 'tube-tier,' almost a criminal,'' Dr. Leao said at the clinic run by Bemfam. More Counseling Needed **********The operation, which is virtually irreversible for women, is often performed here without adequate counseling, he said. **********''There are lines of women at the university hospitals trying to get the operation reversed,'' Dr. Leao said. **********When planning fails, about three million Brazilian women resort each year to illegal abortions. In one of the first such protests here, an American, Joan Andrews, led an anti-abortion demonstration last month outside a clinic. **********Economic uncertainty has also played a role in pushing down Brazil's birthrate. In the 1980's, Brazil's per capita income remained largely stagnant. **********By contrast, in the United States and Europe, decreases in family size generally coincide with improved living standards. In Brazil, where family size now approaches that of the United States in the 1960's, 300,000 babies still die annually before their first birthday. Wants to Stop at One **********''The lower class can't afford to have more children,'' said Solange Ribeiro, who also waited her turn at the Bemfam clinic. At age 28, Mrs. Ribeiro, the wife of a bank clerk, said she wanted to stop at one child. **********''You have to buy yogurt, medicines, clothes, doctor visits,'' she said of her year-old son, Silas. **********But in the past, poverty did not stop Brazilian women from having children. Another woman at the clinic, Margarida Peira, mother of four, said her mother, a farm worker, had 28 pregnancies. **********Many social scientists say they believe that television, which now covers Brazil, has created new aspirations and new standards among Brazilians. **********''Television transmits images, attitudes, values and habits of a modern, urban, industrial and middle-class Brazil,'' Mr. Martine wrote recently in Ciencia Hoje, a Brazilian scientific monthly. ''They are images of the small, affluent, consumer-oriented family, of a divorce between sexuality and procreation.'' **********In addition, a clause in Brazil's 1988 Constitution that stipulates four-month maternity leaves appears to be penalizing fertile women in the job market.

Sporting goods discount stores and mail-order outlets are transforming their trade, as well. **********Discounters used to be confined to selling cheaper brands, since expensive bikes are tied exclusively to specialized dealers. Now they nab manufacturers' closeouts and slow-selling models of better brands and stamp their own brand names on imports. **********The K mart Corporation is leading the trend toward more expensive bikes among discounters. In April, the company's Builder Square subsidiary opened the first Sport Giant store in Madison Heights, a Detroit suburb, and will open another near Detroit this month. The 50,000-square-foot sporting goods ''superstore'' carries 200 fully assembled bike models. It offers popular high-priced imports (from $250 to $1,000) such as the KHS brand from Korea and the Miele from Canada. **********The store is also offering assembly, service and follow-up repairs, which places it in head-to-head competition with the independent bicycle shop. ''The strength of the independents has always been in the after-sale work,'' said William Corliss, a product manager at Schwinn Bicycle. **********Bike Nashbar is branching out too. A bicycle mail-order house since 1974, the Youngstown, Ohio-based company in the past two years has opened five stores - two in Ohio and one each near Detroit, Boston and Washington. The shops offer service and repair, as well as discount prices. **********To get around the exclusive dealer agreements of makers of more expensive bikes, the company deals directly with manufacturers in Taiwan and Japan - the same plants making many exclusive bikes - to produce its own line. ''We have a buying advantage from sheer volume,'' said John Rossi, Nashbar's director of retail development. ''As a result, we sell for what dealers buy for.'' He added: ''We have to overcome an initial objection to the name, but we point out to customers that the bikes have the features they are looking for.'' Since they opened, the outlets have increased sales volume by 20 percent. **********Independents are fighting back in the area they know best: service. The Bicycle Exchange, for example, which opens its eighth shop in the Washington area this fall, offers maintenance classes, organizes trips and sponsors fashion shows and clinics on 10-speed racing. **********The chain's owner, James Bellas, discounts the discounters as a serious threat.

Years ago, the average age was in the mid-50's; by 1985 it was 42. ''Twenty years ago, a lot of retirees thought they'd open up bike shops, that it was an easy way to make a living,'' he said.

Hailed as a model alternative energy project a decade ago, Brazil's alcohol program stumbled in recent weeks as sugar-cane distillers switched from producing alcohol fuel to a more profitable product, sugar. **********With hooded pumps proliferating, alcohol lines stretching and tempers rising with the heat of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, energy officials seek help from afar - tankers filled with methanol from Chile, with corn ethanol from the United States and with a liquid described as ''French grape alcohol.'' **********''You can't really call it wine,'' an official at the state oil company, Petrobras, said, wincing at the suggestion. ''Wine has a much lower alcohol content.'' A Matter of Class **********The trouble over fuel has taken on a special resonance in class-conscious Brazil, because owners of alcohol-powered cars represent the most affluent segment of society. About 90 percent of all new cars sold in the last four years were alcohol-powered. **********In the chic ocean-front neighborhoods of Ipanema, Copacabana and Leblon, the new muse of the beach set this week was Marta, an ungainly Petrobras tanker that docked here to deliver Rio's alcohol fuel in time for the New Year weekend. **********In addition to denouncing distillers who take advantage of high international sugar prices, the talk of Rio's fuel lines centers on various alcohol ''cocktails'' that the Government plans to pump into fuel tanks. **********French grape alcohol and American corn alcohol are met with grumbling acceptance. But the Chilean methanol provoked street protests. **********''Something out of a horror movie,'' said Carlos Minc, a Green Party city councilman who last month led a picket line outside Petrobras headquarters here. Lower Mixture Tried in U.S. According to the Greens, the only significant use of methanol is at the Indianapolis 500 car race and in American urban tests, where the fuel formula is 3 percent methanol and 97 percent gasoline. **********Brazil's mixture would be 33 percent methanol, 60 percent ethanol and 7 percent gasoline. **********''Brazil would become a great laboratory in which its inhabitants would be guinea pigs,'' Tereza Lobo wrote in the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil. **********The Greens warned that odorless methanol fumes would poison attendants working in parking garages and drivers stalled in rush-hour traffic in Rio's mountain tunnels. **********The debate also brought out the casual attitudes that many Brazilian fuel-station attendants have toward sugar-cane alcohol fuel. Frequent Contact With Fuel **********Many work in plastic sandals, splashing fuel on their feet. Others use the fuel to wash their hands or as a home cleaning solvent. Sometimes, underpaid attendants gulp a few shots of fuel as a cheap intoxicant. **********''Fuel-station attendants will have to wear protective gear like astronauts,'' the Rio daily Globo warned under a picture of an attendant wearing goggles, mask and rubber apron, boots and gloves. **********On the road, a Brazilian driver who runs out of fuel will often insert a rubber hose in the tank of another car, start a siphon by sucking on the hose and then spit out fuel. **********''Four milliliters of methanol causes blindness; more than eight milliliters can be fatal,'' the Greens said. **********In recent weeks, methanol was banned as a fuel in Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre, two cities with mayors from the left-wing Workers' Party. **********This month, as the tanker Cabo Negro laden with 50 million liters of Chilean methanol neared Brazil's shores, the anti-methanol chorus grew louder. Greens Protest Around Tanker **********Borrowing a tactic from the international environmental group Greenpeace, the Greens festooned a rented schooner with protest banners and sailed circles around the tanker as it approached a Petrobras terminal in Sao Paulo state. **********To allay fears, the state oil company promised to add red coloring to the colorless liquid. But on Dec. 5, three days after the tanker unloaded, a federal judge banned the use of methanol as car fuel in Brazil until further scientific study is completed. **********In Sao Paulo, environmentalists blocked an effort to ease the shortage with the 22 percent alcohol content of gasoline sold in the city. Scientists said the widespread use of sugar-cane alcohol had cut air pollution in Brazil's largest city. **********With environmental threats largely averted and American and European alcohol shipments not expected until late January, Brazil has settled down to a full-blown energy crisis. **********Taxi fleets have started to glide to a halt, as many as two-thirds of Rio's service stations have closed their alcohol pumps, and last Tuesday a 400-car alcohol line blocked traffic on the Rio-Sao Paulo highway. Converter's Phones Are Busy **********''I get 200 telephone calls a day, compared with 20 calls six months ago,'' said Affonso Carapenticow, manager of Retifica Recamavo, an auto repair shop that specializes in converting alcohol engines into gasoline engines. **********''Listen, I drove from Sao Paulo the day after Christmas,'' he said, referring to a 300-mile drive. ''In the last half of the trip, all the alcohol pumps were closed.'' **********Used car dealers have started charging a 20 percent premium for gasoline cars. **********''When they hear my car's alcohol, they hang up the phone,'' said a young man here who has placed a classified ad in a local newspaper. **********Brazil's automobile manufacturers have changed their lines to produce 80 percent gasoline cars and 20 percent alcohol cars - a virtual reversal of last year's proportion. Manufacturers are also preparing conversion kits to sell to owners. **********In Rio, with a 40 percent shortfall expected in alcohol supplies in January, taxi drivers are lobbying for permission to convert their cars to bottled cooking gas. Prices Being Raised **********To ease shortages, the Government is considering raising alcohol prices, a measure supported by the World Bank, which calculates that alcohol subisidies cost the Government $2.5 billion a year. **********Indeed, low producer prices are at the heart of the shortage. In recent years, alcohol consumption grew 10 percent a year, while land under sugar-cane cultivation shrank 4 percent a year. **********While drivers wait in line this summer, alternatively blaming Government planners and environmentalists, Mr. Carapenticow says he will have no complaints. **********His alcohol-motor conversion business has been so busy that a Brazilian auto parts supplier this week awarded him a free summer vacation in the Bahamas. **********''The telex said, 'Just bring shorts and sunglasses,' '' he said during a brief moment on Thursday when his five desk telephones stopped ringing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/business/economic-scene-soft-landing-metaphor-for-now.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1989-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; 'Soft Landing': Metaphor for Now", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; 'Soft Landing': Metaphor for Now", "body_text": " **********ECONOMICS is a science - some would say a non-science - of metaphors. Growth, inflation, depression are terms that have been around for so long that they have become what the language experts call dead metaphors - dead in the sense that they have been severed from their original biological, physical or psychological roots. **********The outstanding live economic metaphors today are ''soft landing'' and ''hard landing,'' translated from the airport to the business cycle. Are these useful, or are they merely a vague means of adding color to the language of economics? **********They are certainly vague. To some economists soft landing means slowing the rate of growth so gently that inflation declines, but the economy does not crash into a recession. However, other economists, like Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities International, regard a soft landing as including the possibility of a moderate recession. Either way, the essential meaning of soft landing seems to be the gradual descent of the economy from a dangerous and unsustainable state to one in which it will be able to take off again into steady, noninflationary growth. **********By contrast, a hard landing would be one in which the economy descended too fast and out of control, crashing and shattering many businesses and banks, throwing millions out of work, wrecking business investment, cutting off foreign capital, damaging the value of the dollar, ruining the market for foreign countries and exacerbating the world debt problem. **********The evidence is growing that the United States economy is in the process of making a soft landing. Inflation is edging downward. Consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in June, the smallest advance since early last year. And producer prices at all stages of production fell in June for the first time in more than three years. **********The securities markets have been cheered by this news, seeing both lower inflation and lower interest rates ahead. To be sure, the markets may be exaggerating the significance of the drop in inflation and underrating the weaknesses in manufacturing, housing, autos and other durable goods that are reducing pressures on prices but could also reduce profits. **********And the markets may be paying too little attention to the worsening of the trade deficit, which increased by 23.6 percent in May, to $10.24 billion, as American imports rose to a record level and exports fell. The dollar's remarkable strength in recent months undoubtedly contributed to the worsening of the American trade position - and to the Federal Reserve's decision to ease its grip on the nation's money supply. Many investors expect the Fed to continue to bring down interest rates to rein in the trade deficit and prevent too rapid a downslide in the economy. **********The persistence of the big Federal budget deficit puts the burden of fighting recession on the Fed. Although inflation ran at an annual rate of 5.9 percent in the first half of the year, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, said yesterday that he had become more worried about a downturn than inflation. Signaling that the Fed would continue its two-month easing of credit, Mr. Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee that he was worried the economic sluggishness would intensify and result in a substantial downturn. But, he cautioned: ''It's clearly premature, with one month's data, to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us. Certainly they are not.'' The Fed's monetary goal at this juncture is still to engineer a soft landing. **********The Administration acknowledges that the economy is slowing. The Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers have now lowered the official growth forecasts to 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent for 1989 and 1990, respectively. Those are fairly optimistic numbers, as the budget director, Richard G. Darman, conceded this week. Particularly for 1990, the Administration's forecast is well above projections by private economists and the Fed. The Blue Chip Indicators' consensus forecast is for 1.5 percent real growth in 1990. The Fed's just-updated forecast expects 1.5 to 2 percent growth in 1990. **********But the Fed, with all its efforts at fine-tuning, cannot precisely calibrate growth. There could readily be a descent to a growth rate of zero or a negative rate in the coming two or three quarters - that is, a recession. This would set the stage for a more decisive easing of monetary policy, leading to an economic takeoff in the latter half of 1990. **********This is forecasting not by science but by metaphor, yet it should not be despised. The British critic Herbert Read called metaphor ''the expression of a complex idea, not by analysis, but by sudden perception of an objective relation.'' And the metaphoric perception of the markets is for a soft landing and a subsequent takeoff."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/28/business/strike-at-french-papers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strike at French Papers", "print_headline": "Strike at French Papers", "body_text": " **********France had no national newspapers today because of a 24-hour strike by printers protesting modernization plans that threaten to reduce the number of newspaper jobs.

The rain has been unusually promising and the end of the civil war in Matabeleland, this region of the country, has meant farming without danger. **********''I'm looking at supplying 12 tons of tomatoes because I can grow them freely without fear of being gunned down,'' said the weather-beaten Mr. Rosenfels, who as a white farmer was among the targets of opponents fighting the Government of President Robert Mugabe until last year. In the 1970's, Mr. Rosenfels, on the side of the white leadership of Ian D. Smith, was fighting the men who are now his rulers. **********But just as he settles down to a good yield and political quiet, the 64-year-old Mr. Rosenfels, like the other white farmers in Zimbabwe, is facing a new yet inevitable uncertainty. **********The Lancaster House agreement worked out among black nationalists, Zimbabwe's whites and the British Government upon in 1980 prohibits large-scale redistribution of land through nationalization, but it expires next year. The main question in Zimbabwe, as the 10th anniversary of independence approaches on April 18, is this: What will Mr. Mugabe's Government do about the land held by the 4,200 commercial farmers, most of whom are white? Many Side Issues **********The question has many side issues, not least of which is that these large-scale white farmers sit on the most arable one-third of Zimbabwe, while many more numerous small-scale and subsistence black farmers have to make do on inferior land. The land distribution, arranged in the era of white rule, was a rallying cry of black nationalists fighting for independence in the 1970's, but it is one that the Mugabe Government has been unable to satisfy - largely because of the Lancaster House agreement. **********In the last six months, the Government has been making noises that make the white farmers apprehensive. ''Of course, they're nervous,'' a Zimbabwean economist said of the farmers, who have enjoyed remarkably smooth - some would say too smooth - relations with the Mugabe leadership. **********Mr. Mugabe and his Cabinet ministers have indicated they plan to make changes, but their plans have not yet been spelled out. **********''It makes no sense of our liberation struggle that the majority of our peasant families have remained outcasts of our land-tenure system,'' Mr. Mugabe told a rally recently. If there were no ''willing sellers,'' he said, changes in the Constitution would create such sellers, a statement that many farmers took as a veiled threat. Nkomo's Message Is Similar **********Joshua Nkomo, a senior minister in the Mugabe Cabinet since his party, the Zimbabwe African People's Union, melded with Mr. Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union last year, had a similar message for the annual meeting of the Commercial Farmers Union this year. **********Mr. Rosenfels, whose grandfather, a German Jew, traveled north to Matabeleland by oxcart from South Africa in 1894, is perturbed, but, in the manner of one who has known adversity, he remains calm. As the chairman of the Matabeleland-based chapter of the Commercial Farmers Union, he spends a good deal of time these days allaying the fears of 300 younger white farmers. About 50 members are black, farmers who have acquired land since 1980. **********''It's the unknown,'' Mr. Rosenfels said. ''We believe they have the common sense, but we're not sure.'' **********Like many white Zimbabweans, he praises Mr. Mugabe for pragmatism - that is, not disturbing the commercial farmers who provide 35 percent of the country's jobs and account for more than 40 percent of exports. Two-thirds of the commercial farmland is designated as ''strategic crop reserve,'' meaning the produce stays in-country for local consumption. Self-Sufficient in Food **********Despite its population boom, Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries that is self-sufficient in food and manages to export as well, including to neighboring Zambia, which has more fertile ground but usually unproductive economic policies. **********In fact, Mr. Rosenfels is probably more enthusiastic about Mr. Mugabe than some of the poor urban black and rural Zimbabweans who are now complaining that the Government has not delivered. ''All in all, you must give them credit,'' he said of the Government. ''Look at Mugabe compared to the rest of the leaders in Africa. He towers over all of them. It is only his level-headedness that has made Zimbawe what it is.'' **********Mr. Rosenfels, and his farming colleagues, are banking on Mr. Mugabe ''not being so stupid as to break the economic backbone of the country.'' But he also knows that Mr. Mugabe is in some disfavor with his electorate, who will go to the polls in national balloting next year. The popularity of his party is at a low ebb. **********One of the questions the voters will presumably think about is the ambitious promise by Mr. Mugabe at independence that 162,000 farmers on communal lands with poor production would be resettled onto five-hectare plots within five years. Only 52,000 families have been resettled, and agricultural workers say that because of inadequate extension services, the poor quality of the land on which some were placed and the inexperience of the farmers themselves, only one-third are making a go of it.

Keating Jr. They seized control of the hotels, sealed off Mr. Keating's office and announced that he was being discharged as president of the hotel company. **********The hotels are 55 percent owned by the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which the Government took over in April and whose bailout is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. Mr. Keating, former head of Lincoln, was not at either hotel at the time of the raids. **********Law-enforcement officials said the Government made the predawn raid to make sure no evidence was tampered with. It delayed acting until it got approval from the European co-owners of the hotels, fancy establishments with fountains, marble lobbies and a $25 million art collection. With shareholder approval in hand, no court orders were needed, the Government said. **********The move severs Mr. Keating's final ties to Lincoln. He had remained as president of the hotel company and controlled the management of the businesses until today, and he remains chairman of the American Continental Corporation, Lincoln's parent company until the Government took it over, in the face of Mr. Keating's protests. 'Gestapo-Type Tactics' **********Bradley Boland, senior vice president of American Continental, said: ''I think it's absolutely despicable. This is a blatant act of terror on the part of the Federal Government. They used pure Gestapo-type tactics to carry out their vendetta against Charlie Keating.'' Asked how the company intended to respond, he said: ''We are looking at all of our legal options right now. We have not determined what course to take.'' **********After arriving shortly after 2 A.M. at the Phoenician Resort and the Crescent, the law-enforcement officials told the night managers that Mr. Keating had been removed from his position as president of Crescent Holdings Inc., the company that ran them. **********''His services were no longer needed,'' said Dave Loveday, a spokesman for the Government's Resolution Trust Corporation. ''We wanted to bring in new management to the hotels.'' The agency named Hans D. Turnovszky, managing director of the Lodge at Vail in Vail, Colo., to be president and managing director of the two hotels. **********Mr. Boland praised the ousted hotel management as ''the best assembled anywhere'' and said the company was studying what to do to protect them. ''They went out to these individuals' homes and posted severance notices on their front doors at 3 o'clock in the morning,'' he said. **********Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also said the two general managers as well as about two dozen hotel officials - including members of Mr. Keating's family -had been dismissed, and sealed Mr. Keating's office at the Phoenician, where he is believed to have kept important records. **********But it was not immediately clear what evidence, if any, had been found. Some of the agents, none of whom had weapons visible, had been at the hotel under cover as guests. The Government said the F.B.I. agents and the Phoenix police were involved in the raid ''to assure an orderly transition.'' Multiple Investigations **********Mr. Keating is under investigation by the F.B.I., the I.R.S., the Justice Department, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission for his role in the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan, which is the parent company of Crescent Holdings. The Government took control of Lincoln despite Mr. Keating's protests that his investments would have paid off eventually. **********Congress is also looking into the role of five United States Senators who met with regulators after receiving campaign contributions from Mr. Keating. Lincoln has come to represent the failure of the savings industry, which could cost taxpayers $159 billion to bail out over the next decade. **********First nine, and moments later three dozen, agents from the F.B.I., the F.D.I.C. and the Phoenix police, all in suits and ties and some carrying walkie-talkies, entered the lobby of the lavish 130-acre Phoenician Resort. The light pink lobby was almost empty -two guests, still wet from a swim, were standing at the long L-shaped reception desk, joking with a reception clerk. The agents, wearing either small gold buttons or badges labeled ''F.D.I.C.,'' quickly secured the hotel's executive offices across a two-lane pathway from the lobby. Later that morning, they changed the locks on those and other offices in the hotel. The entire action was videotaped by two men working for the Government. Sleeping Guests, Stunned Clerks **********Most guests were sleeping at the time, and aside from the surprised clerks at the reception desk, the shift in control went largely unnoticed, although Mr. Boland protested that agents had escorted employees out. A similar scene occurred at the Crescent. **********Last spring the Government took over majority ownership of Crescent Holdings. But the Kuwait Investment Office, an organization based in Europe that has minority holdings in United States real estate, is the other shareholder of Crescent Holdings, and it is said to have blocked the removal of Mr. Keating from Crescent's management. The European company acquiesced to the Government plan within the last two weeks. **********A Crescent Holdings spokesman sought to portray the move as simply ''a change of management by the company's owners.'' But the use of the F.B.I. and local police in the middle of the night added a dramatic dimension to that description. Concerned about the possible impact on employee morale, a public relations firm was hired by Crescent Holdings and immediately began sending out 1,200 letters in English and Spanish to employees to assure them that the hotels were continuing under new management. **********Mark Randall, the managing director for the F.D.I.C. at Lincoln, said that the Government was considering the sale of one or both of the hotels, but that nothing was imminent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/03/business/arco-to-sell-siemens-its-solar-energy-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1989-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARCO to Sell Siemens Its Solar Energy Unit", "print_headline": "ARCO to Sell Siemens Its Solar Energy Unit", "body_text": " **********ARCO announced yesterday that it would sell its solar energy subsidiary, a world leader in the technology, to Siemens A.G. of West Germany. **********ARCO, based in Los Angeles, said it wanted to concentrate on its core business, oil. **********ARCO Solar, in Camarillo, Calif., has about 400 employees and had 1988 sales of about $40 million, according to ARCO.

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Coastal's financial adviser, has told the company it was highly confident that it could sell up to $1.3 billion in subordinated debentures for Coastal. **********Dennis R.

But to the United States Customs inspectors poking bagfuls of the vegetable in search of cocaine, there was the very real possibility that the produce was just another hiding place for smuggled drugs. **********The pumpkins turned out to be just pumpkins. But scenes like this one are more frequent as officials grapple with a sharp rise in the amount of narcotics brought into the United States in marine containers. **********Last year, 30 percent of the cocaine and marijuana brought into the United States came by sea, say Customs officials, who add that the figure will probably reach 50 percent next year. Customs agents - recently joined at some ports by National Guardsmen - have found drugs stuffed in containers of L'eggs pantyhose, planted in pots of fresh flowers and secreted in the cages of snakes. Coast Guard scuba divers have even found drugs tied to ship propellers. **********''In 1985 and 1986, we didn't dream smugglers would make use of commercial sea carriers because too many people handle the goods,'' said Louis Razzino, a Customs coordinator for the agency's narcotics interdiction unit. He and others say the smugglers' increased use of sea carriers is a response to effective surveillance of Customs and the Drug Enforcement Agency against airborne drug trafficking. **********Whatever the reason, the rise in such seaborne smuggling is further roiling relations between Customs and the highly competitive international shipping business, which is just beginning to emerge from a 15-year slump. **********The shippers are already required, by the 1986 Anti-Drug Act and by a voluntary pact between the industry and Customs, to police their vessels for contraband. And carriers that are found to have transported drugs are subject to heavy fines - $1,000 an ounce for seizures of cocaine and $500 an ounce for marijuana - if Customs decides they have failed to exercise ''the highest degree of diligence'' in their self-policing. **********Shippers like the $2 billion Sea-Land Corporation and the $30 million Kirk Lines already face fines totaling millions of dollars, although Customs' long appeals process has postponed actual payment. Now, worried about those fines, higher legal fees and the cost of beefing up security, the industry is refusing to sign a new version of its pact with Customs, the so-called Super Carrier Initiative Agreement proposed by the agency in May. **********Recently, John R. Arwood, chairman of Kirk Lines, formed the Maritime Security Council to help shipping executives negotiate the terms of the new agreement, which Customs describes as a tougher document than the original pact of three years ago. ''With the first one we were in a 'feel-good' mode; we said it would be 'nice' if they did certain things,'' said John B. McGowan, director of inspection enforcement at Customs. ''Now we're saying that they must do certain things to get diminished penalties.'' **********Mr. McGowan says that under the new pact, a first-time seizure will be less serious than a second. And ''prior violations won't count as much if they stay clean for two years,'' he said. But Mr. Arwood sees the new pact as a betrayal of indications by William von Raab, the departing Customs Commissioner, that conscientious companies could avoid penalties. 'It doesn't reflect Commissioner von Raab's earlier promise to do away with fines if companies show they've been taking necessary security precautions,'' he said. ''We haven't gained anything.'' **********Mr. Arwood says the procedures prescribed by the new agreement - including background checks and fingerprinting of employees and installation of extra lighting in ports - may add $250,000 in annual costs for each trade route (a port-to-port roundtrip). In all, they say, the pact could raise the industry's costs 2.5 percent. **********Kirk Lines, which moves cargo from the high-risk port of Kingston, Jamaica, already reports extra expenditures of $250,000 in 1988 for that port alone. Sea-Land says its overall surveillance now costs about $15,000 a voyage - two to three times more than three years ago. **********These expenses come on top of some huge fines faced by the companies. Sea-Land is appealing penalties of $84 million. Kirk Lines also faces millions in fines imposed last year after dogs sniffed out about 13,000 pounds of marijuana nestled among cartons of biscuits inside a sealed container. Appeals have reduced that figure, but Mr. Arwood still describes it as a ''ransom.'' He says no one on board could have known about the drugs. ''When they mitigate a $101 million fine to $1 million, they wonder what we're complaining about,'' he said. ''I'm complaining about the six zeros, especially when we did nothing to deserve this.'' **********There are other costs, too, shippers say. Customs agents are authorized to destroy cargo - and vessels - if a search requires it, and to hold ships in port for days, even weeks, to examine cargo. Last year, a Kirk Lines carrier was removed from service for two weeks, a delay that the company says cost $250,000 in operational expenses and lost business. The ship was a relatively small one, costing $6,000 to $8,000 a day to operate, industry executives say, but operational expenses for large vessels, some the size of two or three football fields, sometimes amount to $14,000 an hour. **********There are revenue losses, too, as companies shy away from high-risk routes. Evergreen Marine, a Taiwanese company and the world's biggest shipper, no longer calls at Kingston, a trade route that once accounted for 60 percent of its revenues. **********Perhaps to demonstrate that the new agreement could be workable for companies that cooperate, Customs seems to have recently eased its policy on fines in some cases. **********Six weeks ago, Evergreen Marine was fully absolved of a $29 million fine (already reduced from $65 million) when it persuaded the agency that it was not culpable in the tampering with containers from which 8,000 pounds of marijuana were seized. Two months earlier, Customs decided not to levy a fine after it found 2,900 pounds of cocaine secreted aboard a Sea-Land conveyance. **********Still, the agency says it ''fully expects to continue'' its enforcement of the anti-drug act and that it backs the tough stance taken by Commissioner von Raab before he announced his resignation. ''If carriers are cooperating and have tight controls in place, they can expect fair treatment,'' he said then. ''Those who are lax will see a continuation of heavy penalties and more intensive scrutiny.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/11/business/market-place-first-executive-s-unusual-offering.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1989-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 948, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; First Executive's Unusual Offering", "print_headline": "Market Place; First Executive's Unusual Offering", "body_text": " **********WHEN the First Executive Corporation, a life insurance company known for its aggressive investments in ''junk bonds,'' announced plans at the end of June to raise money through a rights offering, the initial Wall Street reaction was that it had come up with a clever anti-takeover ploy. **********Perhaps so, but a new and simpler theory is emerging: First Executive needs the money. **********The rights offering is an unusual one. It is expected to raise $300 million for the company and force the two largest shareholders, whose friendliness is at least open to question, either to put up more cash or see their stake potentially diluted. The latter possibility inspired the view that the rights offering was an anti-takeover move. **********But First Executive faces problems other than the possibility of a takeover. Capital problems have virtually halted its growth and forced the company to start marketing a type of insurance policy that may be less attractive to buyers than its previous policies. A change in accounting rules reduced its book value, and the company faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its ties to Michael R. Milken, the former head of junk bond operations at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********First Executive was willing to buy junk bonds far sooner than other insurance companies, and it has profited from the generally good performance of those investments. **********But while First Executive recorded a stream of rising profits, as measured by generally accepted accounting principles, it did so by selling insurance products that drain capital, as measured by regulators. The payoff from its products is often years away, while the expenses of paying the agents who sell them can be immediate. **********As a result, it was forced in late 1987 to reduce the volume of new business being written. It has also moved to sell policies for which a larger part of the cost is paid by the policyholder in the first year. That eases the capital strain, but also leaves the company with a potentially less attractive product in a highly competetive area. **********These capital problems have raised questions about the feasibility of a leveraged buyout. ''Try as hard as I can, I can't make the numbers work for a buyout,'' said Thomas G. Rosencrants, the research director at Interstate/Johnson Lane, a brokerage firm. A one-time bull on the stock, he now recommends its sale. **********A new accounting rule this year required First Executive to reduce its book value by about $221 million, or more than $2 a share, as some optimistic assumptions were no longer allowed. At the end of March, the company's junk bond portfolio was worth $564 million, about 4 percent less than its cost. After adjusting for that, Mr. Rosencrants puts the book value of First Executive at about $8 to $9 a common share. **********Before the rights offering was announced, First Executive's shares traded at more than $16; yesterday they fell 25 cents, to $13.875, in over-the-counter trading. **********A cash infusion may come soon from the $400 million sale of its New York subsidiary, which went on the block after state regulators complained that the company was too reliant on junk bonds. That sale is awaiting regulatory approval. **********In its effort to enlarge the company, First Executive has for years relied on outside investors rather than operating income. It has the right to take out substantial dividends from its Executive Life subsidiary, but has not done so since 1982. If it did, Mr. Rosencrants said, it could risk losing its valuable A-plus rating from A. M. Best, which rates the safety of insurance companies. **********Under the planned offering, an owner of 100 First Executive shares would get 20 rights, which could be sold in the market or exercised by paying $15 a right. Upon exercising a right, the investor would receive one preferred share, with an annual dividend of $2 a share, and a warrant to buy a common share at $20. The preferred share, paying interest in either cash or more preferred shares, would also be convertible into one common share. The offering is expected to raise $300 million, with more later if the share price of the company rises and it is able to force conversion of the warrants. **********The big holders of First Executive are the I.C.H. Corporation, itself a highly leveraged insurance company, which owns just over 20 percent, and Rosewood Financial, which has 8.9 percent and is owned by the Caroline Hunt trust, benefiting members of the Hunt family of Texas. Rosewood complained that the price for the New York subsidiary was surprisingly low. **********Each First Executive shareholder must now decide whether to exercise the rights, thus increasing their bet on the company's success, or sell them. So far, only one holder has been heard from: First Executive says two of its subsidiaries, which own 3.1 million common shares, plan to sell the rights rather than exercise them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/business/business-technology-the-battle-to-create-phones-for-the-future.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1989-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Battle to Create Phones for the Future", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; The Battle to Create Phones for the Future", "body_text": " **********In the battle for the residential telephone market, two companies -A.T.&T. and Panasonic - are so far the big winners among scores of equipment makers. They lead the way in technology and innovation, and they have the market share to prove it. **********With the competition far behind, the two are now struggling to outdo each other and the rest of the industry in designing the telephones of the future. While engineers at both companies decline to discuss exactly what those phones will be like, for proprietary reasons, industry analysts and equipment experts say that the phones of the next decade will be predominantly cordless and that those cordless phones will be smaller and more portable, with a wider reception and transmission range than current models. Sound quality will also improve. The experts say the advances will be a result primarily of further miniaturization of electronic components - the ability to put more circuitry in a smaller space - and improvements in transmission and reception of radio waves, which will eliminate background noise. **********''It will be a cross between a cellular telephone and today's cordless models, allowing the user to communicate while walking around town,'' said Casey Dworkin, general manager of Personal Technology Research, a consulting and market research firm based in Waltham, Mass. **********The new phones could operate not only on the conventional wire network and on cellular networks that use radio frequencies but also on new wireless telephone networks, known as personal communications networks, that are being built in Britain and have been proposed for the United States. The new networks, which will operate at a higher radio frequency than cellular telephones and thus have a shorter range, are intended for use in densely populated areas and are expected to offer service that is less expensive than that for cellular phones. **********The cordless phones of the future will also be far quieter, by eliminating almost all background noise. **********In addition, the phones of the future will be designed to accommodate a variety of emerging services, like small video screens for those who subscribe to caller-identification services. People who now use this service, through which they can see the number of a caller before answering, must buy a separate device that attaches to the telephone. **********The new phones are likely to include buttons on the keypad that activate other services like call block, which allows the user to block selected numbers from connecting to their phone, and call trace, which instructs the telephone company to trace the number of the last caller. Now, the user must punch several symbols and numbers on the keypad to get those services. Future phones are also expected to have a data message function that allows for both paper and voice messages. **********Engineers at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Panasonic Corporation, a subsidiary of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan, were among the first to equip home telephones with features like automatic dialing; automatic redialing, which dials the last number called as many times as it takes to get through, and a liquid crystal display, which shows the number that was dialed and can even time the call. In the ''feature'' telephone category, which includes phones with features like automatic redialing, A.T.&T. now accounts for 28 percent of the estimated $392 million in sales this year and Panasonic 16 percent. **********The two companies have also made significant advances in the cordless telephone, pioneering circuit technology that has reduced the static and background noise that discouraged users of early models. **********As a result of the new technology, the cordless phone is now the fastest-growing product in the residential sector, and is projected to have revenues of $671 million by 1992. And A.T.&T. controls 38 percent and Panasonic 19 percent of this market, which is expected to have $511 million in revenues this year, according to Personal Technology. **********''Quality and technical innovations are the main reasons that these two companies have been so successful,'' Mr. Dworkin said.  Since the deregulation of the industry six years ago, hundreds of companies have entered the residential equipment market with products that vary greatly in quality, usefulness and convenience. No longer forced to rent from A.T.&T., which had a monopoly on telephone equipment, consumers were quick to buy inexpensive telephones offered by the new competitors. Big and Small Companies **********The industry is highly fragmented and includes big companies like Radio Shack, General Electric, Goldstar, Northern Telecom and Swiss Telephone, and many small and lesser-known foreign and domestic concerns. **********Many phones have been sold at gas stations and discount stores for as little as $10 or $15 or given away with magazine subscriptions. But some consumers have decided that the cheaper telephones lack the quality and durability that they have come to expect, and many have returned to phones from A.T.&T. and Panasonic. A.T.&T. now makes about 25 percent and Panasonic about 9 percent of the residential telephone equipment bought in the United States, which includes corded and cordless telephones, answering devices and feature phones. Analysts estimate that manufacturers will produce 22 million residential telephones this year. **********Much of A.T.&T.'s success in the residential equipment market can be attributed to Bell Laboratories, the company's research and development arm in Holmdel, N.J., which is responsible for the overall design of telephones. Responding to new competition, engineers at Bell Labs have cut to one year from two the time it takes to design a telephone. **********In the past, A.T.&T. designed phones in an assembly-line fashion: the engineering department passed its design to manufacturing, which then gave the product to marketing to sell. Now, the giant phone company gets all departments involved in the process from the start, avoiding costly revisions. **********A.T.&T. puts its products through a rigorous series of tests. In a ''Shake and Bake'' lab, A.T.&T. technicians drop the phones from a variety of heights to simulate accidents. The phones are exposed to temperatures from 40 below to 150, to insure that they function in many climates. Technicians also check the phones for sound quality in special chambers that simulate the telephone network. **********Panasonic owes its success in the residential equipment market to its design of products with convenience features that appeal to the gadget-oriented consumer. **********One of Panasonic's most successful products has been a cordless answering machine, which allows the user to retrieve messages from the cordless handset.

Brady to provide relief to the most indebted of the world's less developed nations. **********The losses occur as the banks set aside more funds in preparation for the day when they must accept less than full repayment on their loans to the troubled debtor nations. Plan at Chase Manhattan **********The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the third-largest banking concern in the country, said yesterday that it expected a loss of $1.12 billion this quarter, largely because it was setting aside $1.15 billion to be held in reserve for possible losses on its $6.2 billion of loans to less developed countries. On Monday, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation added $950 million to its loss reserves, and said it would lose $775 million this quarter. **********Increases in a bank's reserves for losses on its loans are immediately subtracted from its earnings. **********Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase, said the Brady initiative had resulted in ''increased pressure on banks to reduce their claims'' and, at the same time, had ''increased the resistance on the part of some lesser developed nations to meet their contractual obligations'' to repay their debts. **********The Brady plan, which was announced in March, is aimed at reducing the $1.3 trillion in debts of the less developed countries. Earlier, bankers focused their efforts on providing new loans to those nations. Pact With Mexico a Signal **********Mr. Butcher and John F. McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover, both said that the loan agreement with Mexico was a clear signal that they needed to begin setting aside more reserves. The agreement was announced in principle in July, when Mexico had $100 billion in foreign debt, but its final terms were completed last week. **********The pact, which the Bush Administration urged the banks to adopt, requires that banks choose between making new loans to Mexico and accepting a 35 percent reduction in the value of their loans. Few banks, however, are likely to accept the option of making new loans because of the increasing risks of loss. **********Because there are large debtor countries whose condition is more dire than that of Mexico, many analysts have said banks might have to accept reductions of even more than 35 percent with those nations. **********Bank loans to Brazil, for instance, which has $110 million of foreign debt and missed a $1.6 billion interest payment earlier this week, are today trading at about 30 cents on the dollar. Loans to Argentina, which has $60 billion of debt and has not paid interest in nearly 18 months, are trading at about 18 cents on the dollar. Banks and securities firms have begun trading these loans in the last few years as some banks, eager to rid themselves of these loans, become willing to sell at reduced prices. **********In June, banks were required to declare a loss on 20 percent of their Argentine loans, and many analysts expect regulators to require additional write-offs in coming months. Talks With Venezuela **********Negotiations are now under way with the Philippines and Venezuela to provide debt relief under the Brady plan. **********Since 1987, when Citibank added $3 billion to its reserves as pressure to recognize the deteriorating quality of the loans was building, the big banks in New York have set aside funds to cover roughly 30 percent of their loans to less developed countries. But because of the Mexican agreement, bankers are raising their estimates of the amount of reserves they should have to cover future losses. They noted that the Mexican agreement had led to cries for relief from other countries not in the same serious straits as Mexico. **********The reserve at Manufacturers Hanover, at 22 percent, was the lowest of those at the large banks until Monday, when the bank announced plans to raise its coverage to 36 percent. Chase, which was at about 30 percent, said yesterday that it planned to raise its reserve fund to 46 percent. **********To rebuild its finances after the loss, Chase said it planned to sell $500 million of new stock in coming weeks. Manufacturers Hanover also announced plans for a $500 million stock offering. British Banks at 50% Level **********Many analysts expect that other banks will follow suit in raising their reserves. The four leading British banks earlier this year raised their reserves to 50 percent of their troubled foreign loans, a level that is also maintained by many regional American banks. **********''Other banks are going to look and say that, if Manufacturers Hanover can do it, we can too,'' said Christopher T. Mahoney, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. ''Clearly, banks like Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust have the financial capacity to make larger reserves.'' **********Analysts who asked not to be identified said that the Chemical Bank was another candidate for an increase in its reserves. Chemical has reserves covering about 27 percent of its $4.6 billion of outstanding loans to less developed countries. Whether Chemical would also suffer a loss would depend on how much the bank might add to its reserves. **********The amount of the loans covered by reserves will vary from bank to bank because some banks lent more to the most troubled countries. But an unusually low level of reserves relative to loans discourages buyers of bank stocks because they worry that some time in the future, when major debt negotiations are completed, the bank will be required to increase the reserves and possibly take a loss. **********By increasing the reserves now, banks may be reassuring shareholders that it is less likely they will have to do so in the future. **********Because traders and investors had been expecting announcements similar to that of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase stock rose $1 shortly before 3 P.M. when it announced a special 4 P.M. meeting. The stock ended the day up $1.625, to $39.50 a share. Manufacturers Hanover stock, which rose $2.25 on Tuesday, following its announcement, fell 12.5 cents yesterday. $15 Billion Set Aside in 1987 The latest round of increased reserves to cover possible losses is not likely to be as large as in 1987, when banks set aside about $15 billion in reserves, said Robert T. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Insolvency of major banks is not one of the ramifications of increased reserves,'' Mr. Litan said. ''But there is no question that reserves have been insufficient at many banks.'' **********Now that the ice has been broken in a new round, Mark Alpert, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that ''the market is expecting these moves; it is a good time for banks to act.'' **********Not all bankers agree additonal reserves are needed. At Citibank, officials have consistently declined to add to the reserve since 1987. **********John S. Reed, Citibank's chairman, said at a meeting of investment analysts last week that, ''from a practical business view,'' he was comfortable with the current level of reserves. Citibank's reserves of $2.6 billion, or almost 30 percent, to cover possible losses on nearly $8.9 billion of loans to less developed countries ''adequately cover the economic risk on those loans,'' he said. Chase Stock Up $1.625 **********Other developments announced by Chase included cutbacks in its securities trading in London and New York and a large loss from the write-off of real estate loans at a troubled subsidiary bank in Phoenix. **********By withdrawing completely from the market for British Government bonds, and reducing its activities in the American Treasury and mortgage-backed markets, Chase said it would suffer a one-time loss after taxes of $25 million but would increase 1990 earnings by $40 million. In London and New York, about 40 employees will be laid off, Mr. Butcher said. **********The Arizona bank, which Chase bought in 1986 for $75 million, has been a problem almost from the day it was acquired, losing $42 million in 1988 and $30 million in the first six months of this year. Recognizing that the bank's real estate loans are worth only about 50 percent of their original value will result in a one-time after-tax cost to Chase of $85 million. But in the future, the absence of those loans should raise earnings by about $45 million a year. **********About $155 million of loans from the Arizona bank will be set aside in a special company, whose sole job will be to sell the assets, while the remaining Chase Bank of Arizona continues with its consumer banking and lending to small businesses. **********Chase officials told stock analysts that the package of actions would add about $205 million to their earnings in 1990, not counting the profit to be generated from the additional $500 million of capital to be raised from the stock sale. They said $75 million more of stock would be sold in 1990 through more generous features of a stock dividend and repurchase plan offered to shareholders, such as a 5 percent discount on purchases of new shares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/17/world/us-charges-salvador-guerrillas-get-more-arms-from-soviet-bloc.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1989-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 559, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Charges Salvador Guerrillas Get More Arms From Soviet Bloc", "print_headline": "U.S. Charges Salvador Guerrillas Get More Arms From Soviet Bloc", "body_text": " **********Senior United States officials here charged today that Cuba and Soviet-bloc countries had been upgrading the arsenal of the Salvadoran rebels to help them escalate their nine-year war against the American-backed Government. **********The officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said there was a recent influx of large quantities of Soviet-made arms and ammunition, which they charged presumably were shipped through Nicaragua. **********They said the shipments raised questions about the sincerity of recent peace initiatives by the Salvadoran rebels as well as the Nicaraguan Government's commitments to regional accords forbidding outside assistance to guerrilla groups.

Kopasov, said miners had walked away from all but one of the region's 13 coal pits today, asserting that the Government had not delivered on promises it had made in order to settle a nationwide mine strike last summer. **********''This is not just a warning strike,'' Mr. Kopasov said in a telephone interview. ''It will continue until we get results.'' **********The 26,000 miners in the Vorkuta region, which produces about five percent of the nation's coal, are regarded as the most defiant in the country. **********So far, workers in the country's two largest coalfields, the Donetsk Basin of the Ukraine and the Kuznetsk Basin of Siberia, have expressed sympathy with the Vorkuta strikers and staged sporadic two-hour job protests but have not resumed the widespread, 400,000-strong walkout that paralyzed the nation's mines last summer, causing economic losses estimated by the Government at $4.7 billion. **********After that strike, the Government banned further labor walkouts in crucial industries like coal mining, warning that strikes could threaten President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic revitalization. **********Mr. Gorbachev has thus far hesitated to enforce the ban's penalties in the renewed spate of Arctic-mine stoppages, initially calling them aftershocks of the summer strike and saying they might be resolved more amicably than through court action and penalties against strike leaders. **********Kremlin officials thought their problem in Vorkuta was easing last week, when thousands of workers voted to return to the mines after a one-day strike in which the Government threatened to take court action under the new ban. **********But the latest walkout has proved even more extensive, with most of the region's 26,000 miners refusing to work until the Government fulfills the promises made to the miners last summer for more consumer goods and economic and administrative improvements at the mines. **********In returning to work last summer, the strikers stressed that they were reserving the right to walk out again if the concessions were not delivered. But in the renewed strike, miners are demanding some basic political changes as well, including elimination of the constitutional definition of the Communist Party as pre-eminent in the nation, direct popular election of the president, and an end to ''serfdom,'' the practice that deprives miners of accrued pension benefits when they choose to work for a different mine. **********The militancy of the Vorkuta strikers recalls the outpost's history as an icy penal colony, one of the largest and most nefarious forced-labor camps of the Stalin era. According to some historians, desperate laborers there were among the first to rise up to in protest of their misery once the news of Stalin's death arrived. **********The strike already has been declared illegal by local courts, according to strike leaders, but thus far no action has been taken against individuals.

''I prefer it cold, rainy and miserable.'' **********Such sentiments are akin to heresy here. In Britain, a nation known for its rainwear, people speak of sun-filled summers the way the French boast of vintage wine years. And this summer is shaping up as a record-breaker, rivaling if not surpassing ''the summer of 1976,'' a phrase Britons utter with reverence. **********England is enjoying one of its sunniest summers this century. This year is already running ahead of 1976 for the late-spring and early-summer months. A survey taken by Britain's Meteorological Office found that the total sunshine in May, June and July amounted to 839.5 hours, compared with 810 hours in 1976 and more than in any other year this century. 'More Like Los Angeles' **********The figures for August are not in, but it has been a month of mainly cloudless skies. There have been exceptions, of course. It rained on Saturday in London, and today was cool and overcast, but the sun is supposed to return on Monday. And so far, the month is producing about 35 percent more sunshine than the typical English August, according to a spokesman at the London Weather Center, an arm of the Meteorological Office. **********''It's been more like Los Angeles than London,'' he said. **********The effects of all this sunshine -caused by high-pressure air masses lingering a bit longer and farther north than usual - are many and varied. There is, for example, the all but previously unheard-of phenomenon of the homegrown suntan, with bronzed Britons acquiring their glow in the backyard instead of at a traditional place like the Costa del Sol. Sales of bottled water, soft drinks and ice cream are way up. Air conditioners are rare in England, but sales of home units, or ''window rattlers,'' as they are known here, are buoyant this year. Swimming pool installers are working as never before. Ornamental banana trees in Penzance, Cornwall, which just barely survive most summers, are sprouting real bananas. **********Still, Mr. Fish is not alone in his disdain for the hot, sunny weather. There are sufferers. The unaccustomed heat has prompted some court judges to allow barristers to remove their wigs. Tempers have also risen with the temperature. Relate, a marriage guidance counselling service, said calls for help have increased by more than 15 percent. Some London hospitals report an upsurge in knife and gunshot wounds treated. The 'Hosepipe Hooligans' **********Yet the casualty that has stirred the deepest concern is that grand English institution, the garden. Throughout much of England, the shortage of rain has meant reservoirs are low and water companies have imposed a ban on using water for purposes deemed not essential. The use of ''hosepipes,'' or garden hoses, falls into that category, much to the outrage of the nation's gardeners. A few have decided simply to ignore the ban. The offenders have been dubbed ''hosepipe hooligans,'' by the British press. **********The first of the gardeners to be convicted of watering was fined $320 last Tuesday in a court in Devon. A retired builder, Norman Read, said he felt ''bitter and cheated'' by the verdict against him and vowed to save his garden at all costs. **********''I've paid for the water and I'm entitled to use it,'' Mr. Read said. ''It's not my fault if they haven't got it.'' **********Keith Snell, the prosecutor for the water company, said, ''The antisocial nature of this offense cannot be overstated.'' Climate Is Volatile **********To an outsider, the land of the stiff upper lip seems to be overreacting to its summer. Daytime temperatures are actually averaging just above 75 degree Fahrenheit. The hottest day so far this summer was July 22, when it reached 93.6 degrees. And if the gardens are a bit thirsty, they people are not. There have been no bans on drinking water or flushing toilets. **********But if the English are more sensitive to weather than people in most countries, that is perhaps understandable. England enjoys a moderate maritime climate in general, yet the weather here can be quite volatile from day to day, or hour to hour. ''For a populated area, we have some of the most changeable weather in the world,'' observed Mr. Fish, the BBC meteorologist. **********Rain is a good example. It is not uncommon to wake up to a sunny day, be caught in rain an hour or so later, and bask in the sun again at noon. In England, the person who does not carry a collapsible umbrella in his briefcase at all times is deemed an unbounded optimist or a fool - except this summer. Blaming America's Depressions **********In meteorological terms, it is the combination of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, the uneven land configurations of northwest Europe and the atmospheric depressions coming from North America that make England's weather so volatile and often rainy. ''It's all those depressions that come across and zap the British Isles,'' Mr. Fish said. ''So if you got rid of America, we would have sunny weather all the time.'' **********The on-screen style in Britain of the television weather presenter is very different from that of his counterpart in the United States. Asked about American weather telecasts, he replied: ''It's entertainment, all singing, dancing and telling jokes. The weather seems to come in almost as an afterthought.'' **********The other big trans-Atlantic difference is money. The highest-paid television weatherman in the United States is Willard Scott, appearing on the NBC News program ''Today.'' His salary is reported to be more than $1 million a year. Mr. Fish, by contrast, is a British civil servant, assigned to the state-owned BBC by the Meteorological Office. Though a national celebrity of sorts, his civil-service salary is estimated at less than $40,000 a year. **********''The only way I can get paid more is working overtime, evenings and weekends,'' Mr. Fish said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/01/business/briefs-974989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Carolco Pictures Inc., Los Angeles, said it expects to complete a $100 million three-year revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate led by the Bankers Trust Co.

Computers are transforming the railroads, enabling them to cut costs and improve service. ''The electronic railroad is likely to be the most important rail development in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Peter J. Detmold, the executive director of Advanced Train Control Systems, a consortium formed by American and Canadian railroads in 1983 to develop a communications system, with computers onboard trains linked with those in dispatching centers. **********The project, which is likely to be completed by the year 2000, calls for placing radio transponders under the roughly 200,000 miles of track in the United States and Canada. The transponders pick up signals from trains passing over them and transmit the information to computers in railroad dispatching centers, which can then determinetheir speed and their precise locations. **********Now, dispatchers determine a train's location from a display board that receives electric currents sent through the rails when trains pass. But the method can only approximate a train's location. And that slows dispatching functions like switching the tracks to allow trains to pass each other and changing signals directing them to stop and go. **********The more precise information will enable dispatchers to better direct the flow of traffic. The railroad's equivalent to air traffic controllers, the dispatchers can use trains' exact positions to determine the speeds they should travel to maintain their distance from the trains on their side of them. That will help railroads save on fuel. After all, fewer trains will have to slow down to enter sidings - sections of track where trains pass each other. **********In the 1990's, consortium members expect to install computers onboard trains. These computers will display layouts of the track and tell engineers such things as whether an engine part needs repair. The system will be linked to the dispatching computer, which will electronically send orders to the train - authorizing it to proceed onto sections of track or to change speeds. **********The two consortium members with the most advanced computer-aided dispatching centers are Union Pacific Railroad and the CSX Corporation. Separately, each of them have finished building centralized dispatching centers this year to replace several stations positioned along their routes. Computers in those centers will be compatible with the consortium's technology. **********Union Pacific, which is tied with Burlington Northern as the No. 1 American railroad, with $4.5 billion in revenues, is spending $50 million on its dispatching center at its headquarters in Omaha, Neb. And CSX, the next-largest railroad, with $4.4 billion in sales, recently completed building a dispatching center in Jacksonville, Fla. **********Their computers are designed to perform routine functions previously handled by dispatchers and to reduce labor costs. At Union Pacific, taking a freight train from North Platte, Neb., to Seattle previously required 11 dispatchers, who monitored the train's 43-hour journey and changed signals and switched tracks to enable it to pass locomotives. Through its new ''auto routing system,'' computers in Omaha will now signal and switch tracks electronically. As a result, the company needs only seven dispatchers to monitor and radio instructions that direct that Seattle-bound train. **********Union Pacific predicts that the new center will save the company more than $20 million a year, beginning next year. The savings will stem in large part from reducing the number of dispatchers to 310, from 426 earlier this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/29/business/what-s-new-in-the-nonprofit-sector-offsetting-a-loss-of-federal-support.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Bloom", "pub_date": "1989-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offsetting a Loss of Federal Support", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR; Offsetting a Loss of Federal Support", "body_text": " **********The conservative agenda of the Reagan era has forced many nonprofit groups to become much more sophisticated in the way they do business. **********As part of its initiative to scale back big government, the Reagan Administration shifted the responsibility for social welfare from the public to the private sector. ''I believe the spirit of volunteerism still lives in America,'' Mr. Reagan said in a 1981 address on his proposed spending cuts. ''We've let Government take away many things we once considered were really ours to do voluntarily out of the goodness of our hearts and a sense of community pride and neighborliness.'' **********Federal assistance to nonprofit groups, excluding financing through Medicare and Medicaid, has dropped by 20 percent since 1980. Over that period, nonprofit groups in areas from the arts to social services have lost $30 billion in direct Federal aid, adjusted for inflation, and more if Government program cuts that increase demand for nonprofit services are considered, estimated Lester M. Salamon, director of the Institute for Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins University. **********While the President's Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives in 1982 asked individuals and corporations to double their charitable contributions to compensate for the cuts, those sources have not obliged. Changes in the tax laws have made it less attractive to give to charity, and changes in the business climate - like the wave of leveraged buyouts, which squeeze corporate spending - have also curtailed philanthropy. **********As a result, these sources have offset only about a third of the Federal cuts. Individual contributions have risen by just a third since 1982, while corporate donations have jumped by less than a quarter, and have actually fallen slightly since 1985, according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. In lieu of giving more money, some companies stress employee volunteerism. **********With fiercer competition for donations, nonprofit groups have begun to operate more like their for-profit counterparts.

The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, has been highly critical of the House's approval of the plan, which is backed by President Bush. The Maine Democrat said today that he could marshal the votes to block the House plan, although he acknowledged that some form of a capital gains tax reduction was likely to win approval.  [ Page D7. ]  The public officials are not dealing with a question of tax policy and its consequences, but rather with one of political principle. Many proponents of the tax cut, mostly Republicans, have long held on faith that tax breaks for the wealthy would lead to economic growth for all. Others, mostly Democrats, hold that the wealthy should pay more taxes to raise money to help those who are less well off. **********Various arguments have been made in defense of the differing philosophies. **********Arguing that a capital gains tax reduction would benefit people of moderate means, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Finance Committee last week that about three-quarters of capital gains were generated by tax filers who had other income, like wages, interest and dividends, of less than $50,000. Capital gains are the profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets. That proportion, Mr. Brady said, proved that a large share of capital gains represented one-time-only sales of businesses, farms and homes. **********Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director, embellished the point. ''A vote against capital gains is a vote against farmers, small owners of timber stands, people who raise Christmas trees and a father who builds a little, say, submarine stand as a business and his children want to do something else and he may want to sell it,'' he told a news conference. **********But according to the Internal Revenue Service, 76 percent of all the money from capital gains in 1987 went to filers with total incomes of more than $50,000. In that year, 68 percent of tax returns showing a capital gain were filed by people with total incomes below $50,000. But 89 percent of all tax returns were filed by people with total incomes below that level. Calculation Not Challenged **********The nonpartisan staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation calculated that 60 percent of the benefit from the measure approved by the House would go to the two-tenths of 1 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 and that 80 percent would go to the 1 percent of filers with incomes over $100,000. That calculation has not been challenged. **********In 1985, the last year for which the data are available, 82 percent of the money received in capital gains was realized by taxpayers who sold more than one asset during the year. Mr. Brady's statistic, tax specialists said, reflected the fact that the income of many wealthy investors comes almost entirely from trading securities and did not primarily denote one-time sales of homes or businesses. **********On the floor of the House, the main argument of the proponents of a lower capital gains rate was that it would help new business ventures raise capital by creating, in Mr. Brady's words, ''incentives for the kind of risk-taking that leads to new technology and a competitive edge.'' **********Yet the best year ever for new venture capital was 1987, the first year that capital gains were taxed at the same rate as other income. Provided by Pension Funds **********About half the venture capital that year was provided by tax-free pension funds. Much of the rest came from foreigners who do not pay United States income taxes or corporations, endowments and other institutions that would not be affected by a rate change. Individual investors, who would benefit from a lower rate, contributed less than 10 percent. **********Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee and is the chief Senate proponent of expanded individual retirement accounts, says his proposal would induce additional personal savings in the United States. **********Yet from 1981 to 1986, the period when tax-deductible I.R.A.'s were available to all working Americans, the rate of personal savings in the country dropped sharply. It was about 4 percent in those years compared with an average postwar rate of about 7 percent. **********Senator Bentsen also said his proposal would ''help average families,'' as opposed to the well-to-do. But the vast majority of taxpayers, people with incomes below $35,000 and couples with incomes below $50,000, are still entitled to tax-deductible I.R.A.'s. Participation Is Small **********Relatively few of them participate. A study in 1985, when all workers were entitled to I.R.A.'s, showed that 60 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $50,000 invested in I.R.A.'s, 30 percent of those with incomes of $30,000 to $50,000 and only a tiny fraction of those with lower incomes did. Yet the ''average'' American has an income below $30,000. **********Why are such unreliable statistics bandied about? Because no reliable ones exist. Economists simply do not know how much a lower capital gains tax encourages investment, if at all, or whether I.R.A.'s significantly encourage savings or merely lead people to switch savings from a taxable account to a deductible one. **********''The techniques we have to study these issues can't give you the answer,'' said Jane Gravelle, a senior specialist in economics and tax policy at the Library of Congress. ''These are just very tough problems to tackle empirically.'' **********But that does not stop public officials. No one in the House debate defended the short-term nature of the proposal, which would lower the tax rate to a maximum of 19.6 percent only through the end of 1991, after which it would rise to 28 percent. Currently, the top rate is 33 percent, with taxpayers with incomes over about $200,000 paying 28 percent. Provision Aided Passage **********The supporters conceded that a temporary rate cut would be bad policy. They said they hoped the lower rate would be extended and acknowledged that they had put a temporary rate in the legislation only because it was the only way they could get enough votes for passage. **********That is because at a time when lawmakers are looking for painless ways to cut the budget deficit, a temporary capital gains tax reduction would raise revenue in the short run because people would rush to sell securities to take advantage of the lower rate while it was available. The policy would cost the Government revenue in the long term, most experts believe, because the same assets would not be sold later. **********Representative Bob Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, made the right point about tax policy and political principle. ''Ultimately,'' he told the House, ''this is a struggle not between two policies but between two philosophies. The Democratic leadership believes in redistributing the wealth.'' Those who favor a rate cut, he continued, ''believe in creating wealth.'' **********So, if they really want to take from the rich and give to the poor, why are most Democrats supporting expanded I.R.A.'s? Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the Democrat most knowledgeable about tax policy, had a politician's answer: ''You can't beat something with nothing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/14/business/british-retail-sales-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Retail Sales Fall", "print_headline": "British Retail Sales Fall", "body_text": " **********British retail sales fell a provisional seasonally adjusted seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, compared with rises of six-tenths of a percent in August and September, the Central Statistical Office reported.

As a result, any deal for B.A.T., which is based in London, could be slowed for weeks or months should regulators in the nine states where Farmers' units are based decide that a successful Goldsmith bid constitute a shift in control. They could then insist on a full review. **********Farmers, based in Los Angeles, is the nation's seventh-largest property and casualty insurer and the second-largest issuer of automobile policies in California. After a long battle, the company was acquired by B.A.T. last year for $5.2 billion in a friendly deal. Using the Process Well **********One reason the battle lasted so long was that Farmers used regulators to impede B.A.T. **********Farmers persuaded regulators in Washington, Oregon and Idaho not to approve the deal because B.A.T. was not a suitable owner. It dropped its objections only after B.A.T. sweetened its offer. **********Seeking to head off the possibility of a long and bitter replay of those struggles, a representative of Sir James sent letters on Tuesday and today to regulators in several states, contending that any deal should not be subject to their approval. Officials in California, Oregon, Kansas and Washington said they had received the letter. **********The letter, from A. J. Dunlap, the chairman of Sir James's Anglo Group P.L.C., said the deal should not be subjected to state review because it was taking place in Britain, not the United States.

The $75 a share that B.A.T. paid for the company was nearly 75 percent higher than its price before B.A.T. made its initial bid. **********Moreover, the business environment for insurers has worsened since last year.

But the Patent and Trademark Office also issues design patents that protect the distinctive styling and appearance of everything from tennis shoes to toaster ovens. **********Until recently, design patents were fairly uncontroversial. But as style has become more important in the marketing of products, a growing number of companies have contended that design patents do not offer enough protection. **********The matter is likely to set off a significant political debate in Congress. A bipartisan coalition led by the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the minority leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, recently introduced legislation that would make it much easier and cheaper for companies to obtain design protection. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher has proposed a similar bill. **********Bills seeking the same effect have been introduced in every session of Congress since 1976. But this is the first time such a measure has been co-sponsored by the top leaders of both parties. **********Still, the bill, called the Design Anti-Piracy Act of 1989, has many critics. The Consumer Federation of America and the Consumers Union both oppose it, saying it would raise prices for products that are not truly innovative. Automobile insurers are also fighting the measure, saying it would make it impossible to repair cars with inexpensive imitations of brand-name replacement parts. **********''Intellectual property has never, never allowed you to have a monopoly for so little creative activity,'' said James F. Fitzpatrick, a Washington lawyer who represents the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. ''This bill would destroy the entire knockoff market. It would revolutionize retail marketing, I believe.'' **********Supporters of the measure say it is a matter of fairness for innovative companies. ''If you develop a new design, you are making a big investment - not only in the design itself but also in marketing,'' said Bruce Lehman, a lawyer who represents a coalition of companies that support the bill. ''If someone can just look at your design and copy it, they are in effect stealing your investment.'' **********Under current law, design patents can be awarded for any design that is novel and is not an obvious extension of earlier works. It can take as long as two years to receive the patents, although the Patent Office has expedited procedures that can cut the waiting time to less than eight months. The legal and administrative fees usually come to at least $2,000. **********Supporters of change say their biggest complaint is with the standard of ''obviousness.'' Auto fenders and bumpers, for example, may be different for each model of car, but courts have generally ruled that the underlying ideas of their design are inherently obvious in earlier products. **********The proposed law would allow companies to obtain protection similar to a copyright. The company would simply register its design with the register of copyrights in the Library of Congress, assert that its design is unique and pay a nominal registration fee. It would not matter whether the underlying idea of the design was anticipated in other products; the design would simply need to be different. The protection would be extended almost immediately, and would last 10 years. **********Some experts say design patents are more effective than is generally acknowledged. ''Design patents are wonderful,'' said Perry Saidman, a Washington lawyer. ''They work very well.'' Mr. Saidman, who represents Reebok International Ltd., the athletic shoe company, said the bill might help small companies obtain design protection, but added, ''I don't think Reebok's designs are going to be any more innovative in the years ahead by virtue of this bill.'' **********All sides in the debate agree that the most controversial effect of the legislation would be on auto-body parts. Insurance companies say computer-aided manufacturing technology has made it much easier to imitate a wide variety of sheet-metal parts. As a result, they say, factories in Taiwan and Italy have become huge suppliers of parts that are much cheaper than those sold by the auto makers. **********The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research organization in Washington that is supported by insurance companies, says the prices of brand-name parts have plummeted as foreign imitations have become available. According to the institute, which quoted prices from automobile parts catalogues, the Chrysler Corporation charged $180 for the left fender of a four-door Plymouth Reliant in 1984. A year later, after an imitation part became available, the price dropped to $87. In contrast, the institute said the price for a left-quarter panel, for which no imitation part exists, increased slightly. **********Chrysler does not dispute those figures, but said the drop in the fender price resulted from its switch to a cheaper supplier. The company said it was unable to find another supplier for the quarter panel. **********Brian O'Neill, president of the insurance group, said, ''The question is, do we want to give automobile companies a monopoly on things like fenders and quarter panels, which will raise costs for insurance companies, and in the long run for consumers?'' **********But car makers are not the only companies pushing for the new legislation.

''We believe that the Warsaw Pact and NATO at this crucial stage in European development are able to play a very important stabilizing role in Europe,'' he said. Discussion on Reunification **********Upon arriving, Mr. Shevardnadze appeared nervous while posing for pictures with Mr. Worner in front of a NATO logo. By the time the Soviet official left the two men were joking, and Mr. Schevardnadze told Mr. Worner that he should meet with him in Moscow someday. **********In a speech he gave afterward to the European Parliament's political affairs committee, Mr. Shevardnadze was far more downbeat, sometimes even sounding alarmist, as he detailed the many risks that the Soviet Union sees from the possible reunification of the two Germanys. His 45-minute speech was perhaps the most thorough public airing by a Soviet official of why Moscow opposes speedy reunification. **********Voicing concern about ''the dangerous irrationality of destroying postwar realities,'' Mr. Shevardnadze emphasized that it was important to move slowly and delicately on reunification. He admitted concern that his nation could lose an important ally if East Germany merged ito West Germany. **********''East Germany is our strategic ally and a member of the Warsaw Pact,'' he said. ''It is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar realities, namely the existence of two sovereign German states, members of the United Nations. A retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in Europe.'' Backs 'Peaceful Cooperation' **********He added that the Soviets backed the idea of self-determination, but only under several strict conditions. The Soviets, he said, share the view of President Francois Mitterrand that ''no European country can act without due regard for the European balance.'' **********For now, he praised the notion of ''peaceful cooperation'' between the two Germanys with the equality and sovereignty of each respected by all. ''As for the future, it will be shaped in the course of history within the framework of the evolving European process,'' he said. **********The Soviet official asked if it was realistic to raise the question of how to reunite Germany, before several ''vitally important'' questions were cleared up. **********He said he wanted clarification on whether a reunited Germany would be ready to accept existing German borders and renounce any territorial claims. Here he criticized the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, for failing to renounce any claims on parts of Germany that were awarded to Poland after World War II. Seeking Guarantees **********He asked what political and legal guarantees would there be so that German unity ''would not eventually create a threat'' to the security of other European states. **********Mr. Shevardnadze also said he wanted assurances on what place a united Germany would have ''in the military-political structures existing on our continent.'' **********''After all,'' he said, ''one cannot seriously expect the status of East Germany to change radically while the status of West Germany would remain the same.'' **********He criticized those who have urged the East Germans to renounce their statehood and make their nation part of NATO. **********The Soviet official said he also wanted to know what the military potential and doctrine of a united Germany would be and how its armed forces would be structured. He suggested that a united Germany should perhaps be demilitarized. He also asked what a united Germany's attitude would be regarding the presence of foreign troops on German soil. Security Is Stressed **********''Surely the peoples of the Soviet Union are entitled to know what any changes in Central Europe would mean for their future and their security,'' he said. ''We paid the price of 20 million lives for the existing European stability.'' **********At a news conference, Mr. Shevardnadze denied that he was absolutely opposed to German unification, but continued to stress security concerns. **********''Each German state retains the right to self-determination. But it can be only exercised with due regard for the special position of the two German states and their responsiblity to assure all nations of Europe and the world that a threat of war will never again come from the German soil.'' **********Mr. Shevardnadze said that after dinner Monday with the European Community's Foreigh Ministers, he had a long meeting with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany. He said they both agreed that ''tranquility and stability'' must be maintained. Says Cold War Is Over **********After discussing the dangers of reunification in today's speech, the Soviet Foreign Minister returned to one of his favorite themes, saying, ''The cold war is over.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/29/business/money-fund-assets-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Off", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Off", "body_text": " **********The assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual funds decreased by $1.10 billion, to $366.01 billion, for the week that ended on Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

And their patents are being validated at the Patent and Trademark Office and in court. Since the early 1980's, Federal courts have increasingly ruled that software can be patented if it is part of a system that performs a specific function. **********Lawyers warn that the case law in the area is still ambiguous. But the financial implications could be profound for banks, brokerage firms and insurers, which have rarely tried to obtain patents for their ideas in the past. Until now, most companies have had to rely on trademarks, which protect a name or a logotype, and copyrights, which prevent the exact copying of language or symbols. Hint of Change **********The first hint of change came in 1983, when Merrill Lynch successfully defended a patent covering its Cash Management Account, a computerized trading account that automatically invests earnings from stocks and bonds in interest- bearing accounts and lets customers borrow against their portfolios. Two rivals, Paine Webber and Dean Witter Reynolds, attacked the patent as invalid, but a Federal judge upheld Merrill Lynch, which then forced its competitors to pay for a license on the idea. **********A second suit was resolved in November, when the College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., which patented a certificate of deposit used to save for college expenses, sued and obtained royalties from the Centrust Savings Bank of Miami. **********During the last two years, a handful of other financial products and services have also been patented. Merrill Lynch has obtained at least two more patents related to its Cash Management Account and a patent for a system to calculate employee relocation costs. **********Another patent, issued to Henry L. Fox of Jericho, L.I., covers a method for determining the premium cost for insurance policies against adverse weather conditions. Yet another patent, issued to Jeffrey Cohen and Ian Robertson of Boca Raton, Fla., covers a buying club to offer a novel rebate for members when they purchase goods or services. Particular Calculations **********Typically, the patents cover a system that carries out particular calculations crucial to the financial product or service. In effect, this provides patent protection for the financial service itself. **********The College Savings Bank, founded by Peter A. Roberts, has come closest to patenting a pure financial instrument. Mr. Roberts invented a certificate of deposit that is guaranteed to provide parents a hedge against inflation in college tuition. The C.D. is based on historical cost data at 500 colleges. The data show that college costs rise faster than the general rate of inflation. **********To hedge against that, parents can set aside money for schooling at today's prices - plus an additional amount to cover inflation that exceeds any interest income the money will generate. This allows the College Savings Bank to guarantee that a year's payment of tuition now will cover a year's tuition when the child enters college. **********Mr. Roberts obtained three patents on a computer system that calculates the amount required for one year at a particular school and initiated the system in late 1987. When Centrust started selling a similar product last year called College Prep Account, he sued the bank for infringement. In November, Centrust settled the suit by agreeing to pay an unspecified royalty. **********Mr. Roberts obtained patents 4,752,877; 4,722,055 and 4,642,768. An Unusual Rebate **********Mr. Cohen and Mr. Robertson have patented what amounts to a buying club that will give members an unusual rebate when they buy goods and services. **********Under the system, vendors agree to offer goods at a discount to club members, who would also be guaranteed a rebate on each purchase. But the rebate money would be turned over to an insurance company, which would guarantee the customer an annuity after 20 years. The annuity, which would be calculated and tracked by the patented computer system, would be based on the rebates and the accumulated interest and would be a form of retirement savings. **********According to the inventors' attorney, Robert C. Kain Jr. of Miami, the inventors never succeeded in commercializing the idea, and patent rights are up for sale. The inventors received patent 4,750,119. Weather Insurance **********Mr. Fox patented a method for insuring people against weather from floods to droughts. Using historical data on the frequency of weather conditions in a given area, the system would calculate the likelihood of risk, weigh that against the amount and duration of insurance protection being sought and determine the appropriate premium. **********Mr. Fox received patent 4,766,539."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-pan-am-shuttle-takes-a-wry-aim-at-trump.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Pan Am Shuttle Takes A Wry Aim at Trump", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Pan Am Shuttle Takes A Wry Aim at Trump", "body_text": " **********The Pan Am shuttle yesterday introduced a campaign that in effect acknowledges its new competitor, the Trump Shuttle, with ads that jokingly but indirectly take note of Donald J.

On Thursday night, Attila Agh, a leader in the movement that led to the party's reformation at its congress last month, said the number was only 23,000. **********Whatever the total, the party's situation is so dire that on Monday, Bela Fabry, a member of its Presidium, was quoted by M.T.I., the official press agency, as saying, ''contrary to rumors, the Hungarian Socialist Party has not collapsed.'' At that time, Mr. Fabry put the membership at 15,000. **********The party congress set the end of last month as the deadline for the exchange of cards. But in view of the sparse response, it has now extended it to the end of the year. Senior party officials interviewed today in the bulky headquarters building on the Danube embankment made clear, however, that they would be happy to issue membership cards at any later time, too. Exceeded Pessimistic Forecasts **********Taking an optimistic view, Mr. Degen said he thought membership could reach 100,000 by early spring. **********Although the Nyers leadership expected a shrinkage of party rolls before making the name change, the virtual disappearance of the membership has clearly exceeded the most pessimistic internal forecasts. Reflecting the official view just before the congress opened Oct. 6, Janos Barabas, then chief of ideology and propaganda, said in an interview that 400,000 to 500,000 members would remain. **********''The majority of members were happy to leave with ease,'' said Mr. Agh, a political scientist and international-relations specialist at the party's historical institute. In an interview, he noted that to initiate a break with the party would have required an act of political courage, while by its action the party, in fact, set its members free, allowing them to leave the party by doing nothing. **********''It was a tactical mistake to call for the exchange of party membership cards,'' said a senior party official who requested anonymity. ''We were overgenerous by making it possible for them to leave decently and with a clear conscience.'' Was It for Careerism?  Asked if the disappointing enrollment supported a contention by critics of the party that most of its members joined out of careerist motivation, Mr. Degen appeared to agree. **********''They were members of the party because party and state were one,'' he said. ''They did it because of their careers, but not in a bad sense. It belonged to political reality. They joined to get ahead in their professions.'' **********Mr. Agh, who travels widely to lecture to party groups, said the party's structure outside Budapest had virtually disappeared. He said often members who wanted to rejoin found that the local party leadership had faded away, and there was no one to accept their membership. ''It is complete annarchy,'' he said. **********The political scientist said that one week after the congress, 4,000 members had registered in Budapest's Fifth District, where most of the agencies of the Government are quartered, while in all the rest of Hungary fewer than that had signed up. The figures clearly indicate that holders of Government jobs still feel it politic to belong. A Case for the Old Guard **********Many members may have decided not to rejoin because they do not accept the successor party's non-Communist tenets. Orthodox Communists, most prominent among them the deposed General Secretary, Karoly Grosz, contend that the old party could not be disbanded. They claim 120,000 members had signified their continued membership in the original party. **********Mr. Degen said he believed that number to be greatly overstated but said he thought the Communist Party would reach a membership of 100,000 before the new Socialists did. **********But the hopeful view at headquarters is that in the coming elections -Hungary is due to vote by next spring for a president and its first multiparty parliament since 1947 - that the Communists would obtain only the votes of their members, while the Socialists were sure of a much larger electorate. **********Mr. Degen said more than one-half of the party's political staff of 190 had been sent back to the ministries and other institutions from which they had been on extended leave. **********The fleet of black Mercedes-Benz cars, to which senior officials were entitled, has been sold or turned over to the government, Mr. Degen said, except for the one assigned to Mr. Nyers. He said Presidium members now used their own cars and were reimbursed on a mileage basis or else rented cars for official business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/20/business/international-report-sgs-thomson-s-goal-big-enough-to-survive.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Wise", "pub_date": "1989-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1056, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SGS-Thomson's Goal: Big Enough to Survive", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; SGS-Thomson's Goal: Big Enough to Survive", "body_text": " **********In the worldwide semiconductor market success comes in two sizes: large and small. But neither France's Thomson Semiconducteurs, nor Italy's SGS Microeletronica, was big enough to compete in the world market or small enough to succeed in niche markets. The result was a merger in 1987 that produced SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. **********The company ranks 13th in the world semiconductor market but even that, the company's president, Pasquale Pistorio, says, may not make it big enough for success. ''We are still in the area of instability by my definition,'' he said. **********Mr. Pistorio predicts that 8 to 10 companies will have about 5 percent of the market each in the next 10 years and about 100 will have five-tenths of 1 percent each. The ones in the middle will not survive. SGS-Thomson currently has 2.5 percent of the $50.17 billion world market. 'Halfway There' **********''We are only halfway there,'' said Mr. Pistorio, a Sicilian who succeeded in his first challenge of returning the merged company to profitabiliy. In 1988 SGS-Thomson posted net income of $2.2 million on sales that soared 26 percent to slightly more than $1 billion. In 1987, it had a loss of $131 million. **********As a semiconductor manufacturer, SGS-Thomson ranks second to Philips N.V. in the European market. But staying profitable and reaching critical mass will not be easy in a worldwide market that is expected to grow only 9 percent this year, compared with 30 percent last year, and will be flat in 1990, the market research firm Dataquest Inc. predicts. **********SGS-Thomson must either go into new risky markets to reach critical mass or continue on the acquisition path. It intends to do both. **********One important, but risky area for SGS-Thomson is dynamic random access memories - the silicon storage devices used in computers. ''If their goal is to be in the top 10 they have no choice but to be in that area,'' said Bipin Parmar, a senior analyst at Dataquest. Capital-Intensive Business **********The D-RAMs became a money-making market segment for the Japanese after they drove out United States suppliers by using tactics that Washington denounced as ''dumping.'' Those tactics were banned by an accord in 1986 that required the Japanese to stop selling computer chips at below their costs. But last year alone, Mr. Parmar estimated that Toshiba had earned $300 million in D-RAMs, the cost of three fabrication lines in this capital-intensive business. **********In its acquisition strategy, SGS-Thomson is not alone. Midsized semiconductor manufacturers are already teaming up on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, for example, Plessey joined forces with Ferranti. In the United States Fairchild merged with National Semiconductor, and Monolithic Memories Inc. threw in its lot with Advanced Micro Devices. **********SGS-Thomson has agreed to acquire INMOS, a $137 million British semiconductor manufacturer from Thorn-EMI, in a stock transfer. The deal will fill a gap in SGS-Thomson's product line by adding INMOS's much-praised transputer, a 32-bit microprocessor that is used to power computers. The transputer's advantage over other microprocessors is that several of them can be linked to build a system as powerful as today's supercomputers at a fraction of the cost. Support of Its Parents **********Both entering new markets and acquisitions cost money and with 4 percent of its sales servicing its debts, when the industry average is less than 1 percent, SGS-Thomson is at a severe capital disadvantage. While the company hopes to generate some of the funds internally, it will be able to count on its parent companies, the state-owned IRI Group in Italy and Thomson S.A. in France, for continued capital infusions for at least five years. **********SGS-Thomson is also a major participant, along with Philips and Siemens, in the European Community's proposed $4 billion eight-year Joint European Semiconductor Silicon research program, or Jessi, which is expected to begin this year. Jessi's goal is to keep Europe competitive with and independent of Japan and the United States in both the development and manufacture of all kinds of semiconductors. **********In the United States, a consortium of companies, including International Business Machines, Intel and American Telephone and Telegraph, are involved in a similar project dubbed Sematech which has a budget of about $250 million a year. Point in Its Favor **********One factor in SGS-Thomson's favor as it embarks on acquisitions and joint ventures is that it is itself the result of a successful cross-border merger. **********In 1986 Mr. Pistorio, president of SGS, and Jacques Noels, president of Thomson Semiconducteur, started talking about an alliance. Both men shared an American semiconductor past. Mr. Pistorio spent 17 years at Motorola Inc. before accepting a pay cut and the challenge of turning around an ailing SGS in 1980. Mr. Noels, after 17 years with Texas Instruments, was lured to Thomson in 1982 with a similar mission. **********When both executives took their new assignments they found technological jewels but business disasters. ''Losses didn't matter. These were universities rather than industries,'' said Jean-Philippe Dauvin, corporate economic and market research manager at SGS-Thomson. After several years of restructuring, the two persuaded their parents that a marriage was an economic necessity. Mr. Noels left soon after the merger. An Unlikely Competitor **********''Looking at Thomson Semiconducteurs in the early 80's, nobody would have believed the probablility that it would become a worldwide competitor,'' said Mr. Noels, who saw his company lose as much as $100 million in 1985, when the semiconductor industry crashed. **********Mr. Pistorio started to put his strategic plan into action within six months. He shut five factories, laid off 1,900 people in Europe, added 700 in the Far East and cut top management by a third, trying to balance between the French and Italian portions. **********The company is now putting its growth strategy to work primarily in the United States and Japanese markets. Today the United States accounts for 21.7 percent of SGS-Thomson sales, up from the total of 13 percent of the individual companies in 1982."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/08/world/poland-s-changes-officially-adopted.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1989-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 588, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poland's Changes Officially Adopted", "print_headline": "Poland's Changes Officially Adopted", "body_text": " **********With little debate or dissent, the Polish Parliament today approved six laws agreed to at the talks between the Government and Solidarity to restore the banned union's legal status and introduce broad changes in public life. **********At the same time, Solidarity's leadership ended weeks of intense debate among the union's members, urging them to take part in coming elections to public office under the new legislation. **********Leaders of some prominent opposition groups had said they would not take part in the elections, planned for June.

Legal Check on Party Power **********Though the new legislation foresees the pre-electoral distribution of two-thirds of the seats to the lower house to the Communists and their allies, and about a third to the Solidarity-based opposition, voting for the 100-member Senate, whose veto power can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote of the lower house, will be open and free.

''Now we will start talking about it with them,'' he said, ''because now it's possible.'' 'I Am Used to America' **********Professor Jasny, who left his homeland in 1970, said he wanted to make other movies there but would go on living in the United States, ''because I am used to America and New York, and I like to teach at Columbia.'' **********Reached at his home in Washington, Professor Lustig, who spent three years in Theresienstadt and other Nazi prison camps, said he hoped to visit Czechoslovakia every year from now on. But he said he would retain his post teaching literature and film at American University in Washington. **********He was in Italy during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he recalled, and he did not go back. Indeed, he never was allowed to, because as he put it, ''I was proclaimed part of a Zionist conspiracy which was trying to overthrow the Communist Government - which of course is nonsense.'' **********Professor Lustig, the author of eight books, said he hoped to get a visa now to revisit his homeland and ''to listen to the language of masons, of farmers, of the people of Czechoslovakia, because I love this language - this language is a music for me.''

After leaving his homeland in 1969, he said, he has only returned once, in 1981 - with a visa valid for a five-day visit because his father was dying. On the last day, his father died, Mr. Passer reported, and the Prague Government would not let him stay longer to attend the funeral. For years, he said, East European Communist Governments all had a quality in common: ''no mercy.'' **********Mr. Passer - whose most recent movie, ''Haunted Summer,'' was released earlier this year - said he was sure that now ''there is going to be a very productive collaboration between America and Czechoslovakia in the film and television industry,'' with films being made in his homeland ''because they are excellent technicians there, and they have very, very good facilities.'' **********Asked whether he himself might make films there now, he said simply ''I think I'll keep my options open.'' Of Greater Help From Here **********Jan Vanous, a 40-year-old, Washington-based economist who holds a doctorate from Yale, also expressed satisfaction over the events in Czechoslovakia but said he would remain in the United States. He is a research director of PlanEcon Inc., a firm specializing in economic analysis and business consulting on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. **********Speaking from Washington, Dr. Vanous said, ''For somebody like myself who has lived half his life in Czechoslovakia and half here, I am too used to being an American to be able to go back. However, I feel that if democracy is restored and the people decide that they want a sound economy, I can be of much greater help to Czechoslovakia from here than from inside the country.'' **********''Czechoslovakia could become a very attractive place to invest,'' he observed, ''and I would like to help both American investors who are looking for profitable opportunities and Czechoslovak enterprises which might be looking for an investor or to develop a market.'' International Forum **********Somewhat similarly, Charlotta Kotik, an art historian who is a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, said, ''The way I feel I could be helpful to the situation in Czechoslovakia would be to help the artists to show their art in the international forum.'' **********Dr. Kotik, a great-granddaughter of the Czechoslovak statesman Jan Masaryk, said, ''I feel that if I remain here and work closely with the people in Czechoslovakia, I could be useful'' to them. **********The tennis player Ivan Lendl, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., has also said, in an interview published last Monday in The New York Times, that despite his positive feelings about events in Czechoslovakia, he feels his place is in his adopted land.

Wholesale prices for April showed an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent, much less than expected. Gasoline prices, up 7.2 percent, had their steepest monthly rise in nearly two and a half years, but were offset by declines in food and auto prices. The rise in the Producer Price Index matches the March increase and is well below the 1 percent monthly increases recorded early this year.

The suit also said the proposed merger of Time and Warner Communications would reduce cable competition. Time called the suit ''totally baseless.''

Spreadsheets, which are used for tasks such as comparing the impact of a variety of interest rates on financial projections, are the single most popular software program for personal computers. **********The new program is a scaled-back rendering of the first enhancement of 1-2-3, Release 3.0, which was introduced in June. Release 3.0 is designed for users of more powerful desktop computers. In contrast, Release 2.2 is designed for earlier personal computers like I.B.M.'s original Personal Computer. The early computers have far less memory. Extends Computer Life **********The company hopes computer owners who are reluctant to invest in the newest generation of personal computers will accept Release 2.2 as a way to extend the useful life of their aging machines. Release 2.2 will add capabilities such as the ability to link files, which makes it possible for users to create large spreadsheets by breaking them into segments. The new program also enhances users' ability to automate routine tasks. **********Industry analysts have debated which of the new spreadsheet programs will be more popular.

'Ghosts From Our Past' **********''This has served to revive the worst ghosts from our past,'' said Simon Lazara, a member of the lower house of Parliament from the small Unified Socialist Party and also vice president of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. **********Strongly critical of those responsible for the attack, he said it had raised fears that far-leftist groups will now look for a way to take vengeance on the army. That, in turn, might produce a repressive reaction from the military and the Government. **********The Government of President Raul Alfonsin says the guerrilla operation was led by Enrique Haroldo Gorriaran Merlo, a major figure in leftist violence in Argentina and elsewhere in the region for two decades. He is believed to have escaped the base and is being sought by the police. **********Mr. Gorriaran Merlo, 47 years old, was second-in-command of the People's Revolutionary Army, considered the most radical of the leftist guerrilla groups in Argentina in the 1970's. In attacks on police and military posts, kidnappings and robberies, the groups killed, by official count, 688 people. **********The armed forces responded with a counterinsurgency drive in which almost everybody with suspected leftist ties was arrested and tortured or killed. An estimated 9,000 people died after being detained. As a result the People's Revolutionary Army, like the larger group called the Montoneros, was thought all but destroyed. Group Issues Communique **********A group calling itself the People's Resistance Front took responsibility for the attack on La Tablada in a communique published Feb. 1 in the Uruguayan leftist newspaper La Republica. It said some of its members came from a two-year-old legal political party called All for the Fatherland Movement, the founders of which movement included Mr. Gorriaran Merlo and other former People's Revolutionarey Army members. **********The communique said the action had been intended to head off a plot by dissidents within the army to mount a coup against the Alfonsin Government. It also said the Government troops had executed ''various comrades'' after they had surrendered. Finally, it promised to ''continue the fight.'' **********The attack group, which the communique said numbered 46, but which the Government put at 69, broke into the infantry base at dawn on Jan. 23, crashing through the gates in a stolen soft-drink truck followed by a half-dozen cars. Some of the draftees undergoing basic training there were allowed to leave but others were taken hostage. **********The police quickly converged on the base, followed a few hours later by troops with tanks and artillery. It took Government forces more than 24 hours to subdue the guerrillas. **********Officials said 28 attackers, 9 soldiers and 2 policemen died in the battle or later of wounds. Fourteen members of the attack group were arrested. Officials and sympathizers of the left have suggested that the group held out to allow Mr. Gorriaran Merlo to escape. Doubts About Case Persist **********At first, almost no one could believe that the attackers were leftist guerrillas. They themselves helped to confuse things by distributing pamphlets outside the base claiming to be sympathizers of rightist officers who have led three rebellions in the army in less than two years. **********Many Argentines were also skeptical when it was reported that identification papers and other documents found on the first guerrilla killed had established the link to the People's Revolutionary Army and that the attackers had used cars registered to themselves. Some people speculated that this meant the armed forces had somehow staged the event as a means of winning civilian sympathy. **********Osvaldo Soriano, a leading Argentine novelist and commentator with leftist political views, said he thought some members of the Fatherland Movement may have been lured into undertaking the action by military intelligence officers who may have infiltrated the group. ''No one doubts that the attackers were who they were,'' he said. ''What I say is that there was something more involved.'' **********He offered no specific evidence of that and said the attack ''still implies a latent criminality of the extreme left,'' adding that ''the fact of infiltration doesn't mean they were less guilty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/world/soviet-premier-says-cutbacks-could-reach-33-for-military.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1989-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Premier Says Cutbacks Could Reach 33% for Military", "print_headline": "Soviet Premier Says Cutbacks Could Reach 33% for Military", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Prime Minister said today that the Government intended to continue steadily cutting the military budget until at least 1995, slashing annual spending by up to one-third. **********The cuts go substantially beyond those already announced by President Mikhail S.

Ryzhkov, who is in effect Mr. Gorbachev's Cabinet chief, also disclosed the financial cost of the war in Afghanistan for the first time. **********The price of the nine-year conflict, 45 billion rubles, the equivalent of $70 billion, drew a gasp from the congress. A Stay-the-Course Speech **********The speech was generally a commitment to stay the course of perestroika, as the economic revival program is called, without dramatic new initiatives but without significant retreats. **********Responding to a major demand of the deputies gathered here, Mr. Ryzhkov promised that 20 million impoverished pensioners would receive a sharp increase in their monthly stipend next January. **********He also proposed an immediate end to special privileges in health care, including the so-called fourth administration of the Health Ministry, which provides medical services for the party and Government elite. Special hospitals and other privileges were a target of public wrath during the election campaign this spring. **********Mr. Ryzhkov did not call for opening the elite's separate hospitals to the general public, but he said all medical centers should be financed at an equal level. **********He also said that by 1991 the Government would end subsidies for industries operating at a loss, brandishing the threat of bankruptcy for an estimated 9,000 unprofitable enterprises. State farms, another major drain on the treasury, were exempted from the deadline. Gorbachev Presses for Team **********Meanwhile, Mr. Gorbachev convened the first session of the 542-member Soviet legislature and rapidly began pushing through approval of his team for the newly reorganized Government. Some deputies protested that he was railroading the proceedings. **********The legislature also established 14 standing committees, including one on the military and state security that has been promised control of both the military budget and the K.G.B., the state security police. **********During the debate, Mr. Gorbachev agreed with a deputy who said that only civilians should sit on this important committee. **********The only serious opposition came when Mr. Gorbachev nominated Gennadi V. Kolbin, the party leader of Kazakhstan, to head the new People's Control Committee, with powers to insure that officials and industrial managers comply with Government policy. Lobbying for Yeltsin **********Several deputies urged that Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Communist, be given the post because he would be less beholden to the Communist Party leadership. **********But others said Mr. Gorbachev was entitled to name his own team, and in the end Mr. Yeltsin himself demurred by endorsing Mr. Kolbin. **********Mr. Gorbachev told the legislature that Mr. Yeltsin, who was dismissed from the Communist Party Politburo in 1987 for complaining about the slow pace of perestroika, would be appointed to head a committee on construction and architecture. **********The legislature also approved the appointment of Mr. Ryzhkov, the former manager of the huge Uralmash machine-tool factory, who has been not only Mr. Gorbachev's Prime Minister but also a leading economic official since 1985. **********For chairman of the Supreme Court, which is to be given greater independence under a promised reorganization of the justice system, the legislature approved Yevgeny Smolentsev, who has been the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. **********Aleksandr Y.

'Where Are We Rushing?' **********Throughout the day deputies rose to object that they had little time to debate the qualifications of the nominees, or argue that the current fashion for competitive elections obliged Mr. Gorbachev to offer them a choice of candidates. **********''In any civilized country, such debates take several days,'' said Anatoly N. Saunin, a deputy from the Ukraine, before Mr. Gorbachev cut him off. ''Where are we rushing today?'' Mikhail A. Bocharov, a Moscow deputy, said afterward that many deputies had hoped to see more fresh blood in the leadership. **********''Mr. Gorbachev is the leader, and nobody doubts it,'' he said. The Military Disclosures **********Mr. Ryzhkov's speech on the state of the economy included some new disclosures, including breakdowns of the military and space budgets. **********Mr. Gorbachev had earlier announced plans to cut the military budget by 14 percent over the next two years, but Mr. Ryzhkov disclosed that the Soviet leadership has in mind a more ambitious rollback. **********''We intend to proceed persistently along the road of disarmament, seeking to reduce the share of national income devoted to defense expenditures by one-third to one-half by 1995,'' he said. **********According to official figures, the military budget now accounts for about 12 percent of the Soviet national income. Assuming income grows at about 4 percent a year, Mr. Ryzhkov's forecast would translate into spending cuts of up to one-third from the current level of spending in 1995. **********Mr. Gorbachev last week put total military spending at 77.3 billion rubles, equivalent to about $128 billion at official exchange rates, a figure considerably lower than most Western estimates. **********One indication that Mr. Gorbachev's figure does not cover all military spending came today when Mr. Ryzhkov disclosed the budget for the space program - 6.9 billion rubles, including 3.9 billion ''for defense purposes.'' Praise From Economists **********Mr. Ryzhkov's speech was generally received warmly by economists who advocate moving the Soviet Union toward a more market-oriented economy. **********Pavel G. Bunich, chairman of a committee on industrial financing in the Academy of Sciences, commended Mr. Ryzhkov for defending private entrepreneurs, who have come under sharp public attack for charging high prices. **********Mr. Ryzhkov was applauded when he criticized ''greed and self-interest'' in the growing private sector, but he went on to say this sector must be protected. **********''That took a certain amount of courage,'' Mr. Bunich said. **********''It was realistic,'' said Nikolai P. Shmelev, another economist regarded as a radical reformer. ''From my point of view, not radical enough, but realistic.'' **********While Mr. Bunich chided Mr. Ryzhkov for carefully avoiding any mention of when the Government might end subsidies on retail prices, Mr. Shmelev noted that most economists now realize that a new price system would lead to inflation and serious public unrest. **********''It's very dangerous from a social point of view,'' Mr. Shmelev said. ''It is necessary, but it must be postponed.'' **********The congress and the smaller legislature are to continue work through Saturday, setting guidelines for domestic and foreign policy and considering more Government appointments. **********One Government economist, Abel G.

Noting the difficulties the town has been having in recruiting such employees, Gerard Finn, president of the Selectmen's Housing Policy Committee, said, ''There was virtually no housing at all under $300,000.'' **********The high cost of housing has also created difficulties for businesses trying to hire workers, said Peter Flierl, honorary chairman of the Greenwich Housing Authority, which has long been involved in creating and managing subsidized rental housing in Greenwich. **********The seven families will buy their homes at Swan Court, a 39-unit luxury-level development along the Post Road in the Cos Cob section. They will be chosen through a combination of need, income assessment and a lottery. Their homes will be scattered throughout the project of duplex and single-level units carrying a market price of more than $300,000 each. **********The only differences, said F. T. Associates, a consortium of local investors undertaking the project, will be the interior finishes and quality of certain appliances - vinyl for the lower-cost units instead of tile flooring in bathrooms and kitchens; a lower grade of cabinetry and carpeting, and one and a half bathrooms instead of two. **********The project is being produced under an innovative two-year-old zoning regulation that provides a density bonus to a developer willing to produce a percentage of units that regardless of cost will sell for no more than four times the median municipal full-time salary in the proceeding year. **********Since that median stood at $27,500 in 1988, a sale price of about $110,000 was set. John P. Tesai, a principal with the developers, estimates that the cost of producing each unit, aside from the cost of the land, was at least $40,000 more. But he added that the density bonus, which allows for the construction of more units on a given parcel than is normally permitted. has more than made up for the contribution. **********The plan to use Swan Court as one of the early trial projects started in December 1986, when the consortium acquired the 1.5-acre site along East Putnam Avenue where the Clam Box restaurant had stood since the early 1940's. Under normal zoning, the land, costing $3.5 million, could have been developed with 22 units and 6,000 square feet of retail space. **********But under the new zoning ordinance, Mr. Tesai said, he knew that a floor area bonus of 50 percent might be available if he and his associates were willing to include some moderately priced units. It seemed an ideal place to start, he said, particularly since the entire project was being viewed as less costly housing by Greenwich standards. **********Mr. Tesai said the architectural review committee seemed especially vigilant that the character of the town not be jeopardized. **********The development, designed by Colangelo Associates of Stamford, consists of a cluster of three three-story buildings with a Victorian flair. They face an interior courtyard with a gazebo and a fountain. The gazebo covers an elevator that brings residents up from a below-grade parking garage. **********In addition to the seven specially priced units allocated for the program, 11 more were sold on the open market just before construction at prices ranging from $299,000 to $360,000. The developers plan to sell the remaining units for $353,000 to $408,000 when the project is completed this fall. **********A similar deal is evolving nearby at Bell Manor, a 22-unit condominium that will produce 4 more specially priced units. Anticipating that the subsidized units could give unfair windfall profits to those who win the opportunity to buy, James Sandy, the town planner, said officials had put in a special deed restriction that allows the purchaser of such a unit to sell it only at the price paid plus 6 percent annual appreciation. The new buyer would be selected by the town under the existing system. **********Greenwich is also exploring other sites for moderate-cost housing, like vacant schools, two of which have already been turned into subsidized rentals in recent years. **********In 1988 the town officials persuaded the state to sell them the obsolete 13-acre Cos Cob power plant for $1 and a promise that 25 percent of the land would be set aside for moderately priced housing. **********As Mr. Flierl noted, ''It's surprising how many opportunities can be found or created when a town finds itself almost compelled to produce affordable housing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/28/world/soviet-deputies-in-show-of-power-block-8-nominees.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1989-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET DEPUTIES, IN SHOW OF POWER, BLOCK 8 NOMINEES", "print_headline": "SOVIET DEPUTIES, IN SHOW OF POWER, BLOCK 8 NOMINEES", "body_text": " **********The new Soviet legislature won its first major skirmish in the battle for control of the Government today when it blocked the appointment of eight top officials approved by the Communist Party. **********Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the deputies that he was dropping his nomination of six ministers, including those in charge of culture, the state bank, the state price-setting committee and the petroleum industry, after the nominees were rejected by committees of the quasi-democratic legislature for being too closely identified with past policies. **********Two others, most notably a protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev who had been named to oversee the all-important business of food production, withdrew their own candidacies in the face of likely defeat. Other Challenges Expected **********''We have to get used to this,'' Mr. Ryzhkov said in an interview after he conceded defeat during a session of the 542-member legislature, called the Supreme Soviet. **********Although the rest of Mr. Ryzhkov's nominees to the 71-member Council of Ministers - the leadership of the executive branch of Government - survived committee hearings, several are expected to face challenges before the legislature gives its final approval to the new Government. **********Mr. Ryzhkov's appointments would almost certainly have had the blessing of the Communist Party Politburo and Mr. Gorbachev, the leader of the party. **********''Had they been incompetent, poor managers, I would not have proposed them for these positions,'' Mr. Ryzhkov said. Although he might have used the Communist Party's guaranteed majority to force the names through the legislature, the Prime Minister said he ''could not find any serious evidence'' to refute the criticism of the legislators. **********''These people do not meet the growing demands of the people's deputies,'' he said. New Candidates Awaited **********Mr. Ryzhkov said he hoped to come up with new candidates acceptable to the legislators by July. **********The Prime Minister's placid acceptance of the parliament's will suggested that the nominees may have been put forward to satisfy various high-level constituencies rather than out of Mr. Ryzhkov's personal enthusiasm. **********Indeed, the economist Leonid I. Abalkin, a top Ryzhkov deputy, said today that in his view, ''these weren't the best candidates.'' **********''It would have been possible to find more competent leaders,'' he said. **********But the defeats were regarded by many legislators as a turning point - a demonstration to those who run the Government that they have a master other than the Communist Party. No Government official had ever been rejected by the rubber-stamp legislatures of the past. **********''It is really principally important because for the first time in I don't know how many tens of years the members of the Government feel they depend on the elected deputies,'' said Igor Gryazin, a deputy from the republic of Estonia. Court Nominees Rejected **********Legislative committees have also spurned three nominees to the Supreme Court on the ground that they were not well versed in the law, and rejected a deputy federal prosecutor accused of obstructing investigations into high-level corruption. These nominations are also expected to be dropped. **********The jockeying for power in the Supreme Soviet also includes a pitched battle over control of the military and the state security police, which has drawn together an unusual alliance of civilian liberals and young military officers calling for a more professional, streamlined and publicly accountable military and K.G.B. **********The immediate issue is the makeup of a critical Supreme Soviet committee that will oversee the budgets and activities of those traditionally secretive institutions. **********The panel, with a majority consisting of senior military officers, K.G.B. officers, directors of defense military factories and local party officials, has won initial approval, but critics have vowed to continue their fight. Committee Is Expanded **********In a preliminary round, critics forced the expansion of the committee to include a deputy from the once-independent Baltic republic of Lithuania, where the Soviet Army is widely disparaged as an ''occupying force.'' **********''That committee should be an organ of civilian control,'' said Mr. Gryazin, the Estonian deputy. ''We want to be sure that there will never be any kind of coup d'etat from the military or the K.G.B.'' **********This week the chairman of the committee, a missile expert named Vladimir L. Lapygin, sought to offset this concern with an interview in Izvestia, in which he endorsed establishment of a volunteer, professional army - a position opposed by the military leadership - and called for tighter control of the K.G.B. **********Much of the power struggle has taken place in closed committee meetings, with only sketchy reports in the press. **********Beginning Monday, the legislature ended its practice of live television and radio broadcasts, on the ground that the novel, uninhibited legislative debate was distracting the public from work. Sharp Drop in Production **********The press agency Tass said the leadership of the legislature decided to cut back on television coverage after learning that industrial production had fallen by 20 percent during live broadcasts. **********Meetings of the legislature are open to foreign and Soviet reporters, and taped excerpts of the livelier sessions, including today's meeting, are being broadcast in the evenings. **********The defeat of the new Government ministers was an indication that although the Communist Party can dominate the legislature on major questions, some of the working committees that will do most of the work of writing new laws are determined to assert their independence and that the leadership, for now, is wary of seeming to ride roughshod over the minority. **********The most senior official dropped from the new Government was Vladimir I. Kalashnikov, a provincial party boss, who as First Deputy Prime Minister would have overseen the troubled food sector. Legislators from farm regions accused him of being unsympathetic to agricultural reform, although he spent most of his career working under Mr. Gorbachev in his home region of Stavropol. Nominee's Record Attacked **********Another early Gorbachev associate among the defeated was Marat V. Gramov, named to head the state sports committee. He worked as an editor of the Communist Party newspaper and party official in Stavropol when Mr. Gorbachev was party leader there. **********Two nominees apparently fell victim to a strong environmentalist tide in the legislature: Gennadi P. Bogomyakov, a party leader in the Tyumen oil and gas region, was rejected as head of the Petroleum Ministry after Izvestia published a scathing attack on his environmental record, and Polad A. Polad-Zade failed to a win promotion to head the Ministry of Irrigation amid charges the ministry had recklessly wasted scarce water resources. **********The environment has become such a delicate issue that Mr. Ryzhkov said four top scientists had turned down offers to head the state committee on ecology, a post that remains unfilled. **********''I think they felt that this job would bring very little joy to their lives,'' Mr. Ryzhkov told reporters later. **********Vasily G. Zakharov, the incumbent Minister of Culture, was dropped after a campaign by ethnic minorities who consider the ministry a symbol of federal attempts to dilute their traditional cultures. **********Vladimir G. Gribov, formerly of the state planning agency, was rejected as head of Gosbank, the chief state bank, and Lira I. Rosenova, a 20-year veteran of the controversial price-setting committee, received only a single vote in support of her nomination to be promoted chief of the panel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/29/business/company-news-investcorp-to-acquire-700shop-carvel-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1989-11-29", "snippet": "LEAD: Thomas Carvel, the 83-year-old chairman of the Carvel Corporation, agreed yesterday to sell a controlling interest in the private Yonkers-based ice-cream store chain to Investcorp, an international investment bank.", "word_count": 264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nInvestcorp to Acquire 700-Shop Carvel Chain", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nInvestcorp to Acquire 700-Shop Carvel Chain", "body_text": " **********LEAD: Thomas Carvel, the 83-year-old chairman of the Carvel Corporation, agreed yesterday to sell a controlling interest in the private Yonkers-based ice-cream store chain to Investcorp, an international investment bank. **********Thomas Carvel, the 83-year-old chairman of the Carvel Corporation, agreed yesterday to sell a controlling interest in the private Yonkers-based ice-cream store chain to Investcorp, an international investment bank. **********In a prepared statement, Investcorp said it had acquired control of Carvel in a transaction worth more than $80 million.

But their opening positions in the weeklong talks showed little give on crucial issues. **********Despite significant progress on the international aspects of the conflict since the Chinese and Soviet Foreign Ministers met in Moscow in December, the Cambodians themselves are still deeply divided over the form of an interim government and the nature of an international peacekeeping force to monitor any agreement. **********The Government in Phnom Penh, installed by the Vietnamese after they invaded Cambodia 10 years ago, calls for a four-party National Reconciliation Council to prepare elections and write a new constitution, while Prime Minister Hun Sen continues to administer the country. **********But Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the leader of the guerrilla coalition that includes the Khmer People's National Liberation Front of Son Sann and the Khmer Rouge, demands the dissolution of the Phnom Penh Government and a provisional, four-party government and four-party national army. **********Mr. Hun Sen calls this a recipe for the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, whose previous rule, from 1975 to 1979, left more than a million Cambodians dead. **********A paper submitted to the factions by the chairman of the talks, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia, said the failure to resolve this issue would ''crucially impair the attainment of a comprehensive solution'' and render ''effective implementation of any agreements on the other external aspects of a solution practically impossible.'' **********Mr. Alatas's paper identified other issues that ''need to be addressed and resolved if further substantial progress is to be made.'' **********One issue, the paper said, is the nature, composition and mandate of an international control body to monitor any agreement and keep the peace. **********The coalition wants an armed force of at least 2,000 men. Vietnam and Mr. Hun Sen oppose an independent force as ineffective and as an infringement on Cambodian sovereignty, and instead want a much smaller contingent, dubbed a ''mechanism,'' that would act on behalf of the government. **********Another issue cited by the Alatas paper is a timetable for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia in relation to the cessation of all outside military assistance to the Cambodian factions. **********The Vietnamese say they will withdraw their remaining troops by the end of September if there is a comprehensive settlement that includes a cutoff of Chinese aid to the opposition. **********Hanoi and Mr. Hun Sen want the aid cutoff in tandem with the troop withdrawal, while Prince Sihanouk wants no linkage between the Vietnamese withdrawal and external aid, with aid to stop only when the Vietnamese are gone.

But over the next few weeks market participants will be faced with the looming presence of a huge supply of long-term bonds, and the sight of all those new issues could help push up yields. **********''The Fed probably won't ease policy again for the next two or three weeks, until after employment data for July are released in early August,'' said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. In the meantime, he said, ''the market's focus could turn away from the economy, and how weak it is, to the upcoming supply.'' Bonds for Savings Bailout **********In addition to the bonds that will be part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions next month, between now and the end of September dealers may face the first wave of bonds to be sold as part of the $50 billion package to bail out the savings and loan industry. **********Debate about the package will resume in Congress this week. Of particular importance to market participants, Mr. Slifer said, is whether the securities will be treated as part of the Federal budget, or if they will be an ''off-budget item,'' as the Bush Administration wants. **********Resolution of that struggle will have ''immense implications'' for the bond market, Mr. Slifer said. **********''If the funds are treated as part of the budget, they will become part of the Treasury's financing requirement and will be financed throughout the entire spectrum of the yield curve, from Treasury bills to bonds,'' he said. The Off-Budget Alternative **********If the package is treated as an off-budget item, however, only long-term bonds would be sold. In that case, bond yields would almost certainly rise from current levels and the yield curve would steepen strikingly, Mr. Slifer added. **********By the end of last week, yields on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 stood at 8.08 percent, up only slightly from 8.04 percent on July 7. **********The off-budget/on-budget question may also come up on Thursday, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to give Congress his semiannual look at the economy under the terms of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. **********Earlier this month, bond yields shot up briefly after Mr. Greenspan said he was in favor of treating the savings and loan financing as an off-budget item. Greenspan Apt to Be Cautious **********On other matters, analysts said that Mr. Greenspan was apt to be a bit more cautious. **********''We think he will take the view that while growth has clearly moderated, the Fed does not view a recession as being imminent in any sense,'' said Richard B. Berner, a vice president and economist at Salomon Brothers. ''He is also likely to say that inflation, while it is moderating, is still too high for the Fed's taste. The Fed does not want to validate 5 percent inflation.'' **********Signs that inflationary pressures are easing were evident in June producer price data released on Friday and are likely to be seen in Wednesday's consumer price report, analysts said. **********''There is evidence on a broad front that inflationary pressures are waning,'' said Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''You see it in primary processing products like scrap steel and copper. Food prices are falling, as have precious metals'. And it also appears that wage increases have been generally restrained through this period of higher producer and consumer prices.'' Fed's Focus May Be Shifting **********Mr. Greenspan is almost certain to reiterate the Fed's concern about inflation, but after raising rates for more than a year to help cool price pressures, the central bank's focus may be shifting. **********To the Fed, ''at this juncture, the real economy is as important as inflation,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''The Fed can still afford to guard against inflation as long as unemployment remains low. But keeping unemployment low was, is and always will be more important to the Fed than keeping down inflation.'' **********Mr. Fine and other analysts are projecting that the consumer price report for June will show that prices rose by three-tenths of a percentage point, half the May increase. As in the producer price report, falling energy and food prices are expected to be primarily responsible for the decline. And the outlook for the rest of the summer is promising, said Bruce Vertes, an economist at Salomon Brothers. **********Writing in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit, Mr. Vertes said that ''slower consumer price increases should persist through summer, as energy prices continue to decline.'' He also noted that ''inflation has cooled in third quarters of recent years,'' reflecting seasonal price changes of some items, particularly apparel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/world/voices-party-faithful-searching-for-path-new-era-disgust-with-tyrants-erik-m.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1080, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series; Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " DISGUST WITH TYRANTS: Erik M.

Ametistov, 54, a Moscow lawyer specializing in international law at a Government research institute, is a member of the Gorbachev generation. He has recently been working on reforms of the legal code, and has been active in some unofficial political groups . **********I joined the Party rather late. I was 33. That was in 1967. I must say that I hesitated a long time before taking that step. . . . I have always had extremely high regard for individual freedom and independence, and of course joining the Party would to a certain degree restrict my endeavors. Moreover, I came of age during the period we now call the Khrushchev thaw - from the mid-1950's to the early 1960's. . . . **********I understood very well that if I joined the party, I would have to share responsibility for everything that happened in our country - both in former times and in the future. And this to a considerable degree caused me to hesitate, because after everything that happened in the Stalinist era became known, naturally one doubted whether one should share responsibility for all that. . . . Some of the intelligentsia came to believe that we shouldn't leave the party but on the contrary we should join it in order to try to do something to halt the restoration of Stalinism. This was probably the major reason why I joined the party. . . . **********It seems to me there is a serious crisis in Communist ideology, especially in our country. We are now re-evaluating what was done before and are trying to find new paths of orientation. At the same time, we are trying not to lose our principles. . . . I must tell you that for the first time in many years I feel like a man who is no longer in the opposition. For the first time since the 50's I feel I am in a circle of people that totally supports the ideas of those who are in power now. On the other hand, those who were formerly on the side of the authorities are now in the opposition. **********I am a fervent supporter of Gorbachev. I think in the present situation, where, unfortunately, in our country everything is based on the individual, Gorbachev the individual is very much needed. That is why I support him. This doesn't mean that I agree with everything he says . . . . For example, it was announced more than a year ago, at the January plenum, that we were all on the same side of the barricade. . . . In the first place, If we are all on the same side of the barricade, why do we need a barricade? Second, it seems to me that a lot of different people have gathered on that one side of the barricade. It's crowded here on this side.  I cannot share values with such people as, for example, the former procurator Shekhovtsev, who brought a suit against Sovetskaya Kultura and Oles Adamovich in defense of Stalin. I cannot share anything with Nina Andreyeva. I cannot accept that I share ideals with thousands who are guilty of mass repressions during the Stalin era. These were executioners or their helpers -and they are still around. So it is hard to talk about unity in the party. **********In my opinion . . . the idea of unity at one time became a paranoia and led to many negative consequences. It was the idea of party unity that brought Stalin to the top of the power pyramid. This was how he suppressed his opponents. . . . **********I have already said that I am a strong ideological supporter of Gorbachev's policies. This doesn't mean that I like everything he does. For example I totally disagree with his approach to the country's nationalities question, to what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh. I think that a compromise could have been found there. . . . Nevertheless, I think of myself as his dedicated supporter.  * **********I have much respect for Lenin. . . . However, I think that he was also responsible for many of the things that led us to the situation of the 20's and 30's. . . . I think that the idea of Party unity played a tragic role here, and he supported this. When he supported it, it was probably necessary. But later it was used for the opposite purpose of what Lenin was striving for. . . . Ten Hitlers could not have harmed our country and Communism as a whole more than Stalin. I am not describing him as a false prophet. He was evil incarnate. No one could rival him, not even Ivan the Terrible. Then there was Trotsky who, it seems to me, did not differ too much from Stalin.  * When our troops went into Afghanistan, this was one of the times when I was ashamed. . . . . From the very beginning I thought this was a colossal mistake, one of the events that undermined detente. It did not bring us the slightest benefit. It brought us 14,000 casualties.

Clair Gilk, a United States Air Force officer who piloted one of two Black Hawk helicopters that found the plane at 1 P.M. #45 Miles From Destination The plane was 45 miles northeast of its destination, Fugnido, a refugee area near the Sudanese border. Mr. Leland, a Texas Democrat and the chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was planning to inspect conditions among Sudanese refugees at the camp. **********The site is 235 miles southwest of Addis Ababa and 16 miles southeast of Dembidolo, a region that had been a focus of the six-day search. **********The helicopter that first spotted the wreckage carried Representative Gary L. Ackerman, who said rescue workers lowered to the cliffside by cable radioed back that ''everyone had died instantaneously on the moment of impact.''

''It was difficult to identify some of the people, but Mickey Leland was definitely among them,'' Mr. Ackerman said.

Stan Bloyer, said in Washington. They would then be taken to an Air Force base in Spain, he said. **********The weather around Dembidollo was extremely bad on the day of the crash, residents there and an Ethiopian pilot involved in the search said. The pilot, Capt. Adem Deleta of Ethiopian Airlines, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had spent Tuesday night in Dembidollo after searching the area all day and had been told by residents that there was ''so much fog on Monday people couldn't see each other.'' **********The finding of Mr. Leland's plane, chartered by the United States Embassy from the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and piloted by a former Ethiopian Air Force colonel, came after an extensive air search. **********Ethiopian planes drawn from the air force and from Ethiopian Airlines began the search on Tuesday. An Ethiopian fleet of 12 planes was joined on Thursday by 2 United States C-130's. An American U-2 reconnaissance plane flew over western Ethiopia during the week and four Black Hawk helicopters joined the effort yesterday. Low Clouds and Storms **********But low clouds and thunderstorms, typical of western Ethiopia during the rainy season, slowed the search most days, causing aircraft to return to base early or to be selective about where they flew. It was on the strength of a report late last Monday that a plane had been heard, but not seen, circling above Dembidollo around noon that the search concentrated there. **********Describing how the Black Hawk helicopter discovered the wreckage, Mr. Ackerman said on his return tonight that he had learned after landing at an air strip in Dembidollo that there were ''rumors of a downed plane.'' **********A Roman Catholic missionary at the airstrip, who reported the rumor from a nearby village, introduced Mr. Ackerman to a surveyor who said he could lead the searchers to the village. **********The surveyor boarded the helicopter and on the way to the village the Air Force crew spotted the wreckage ''high up on the mountain,'' the Congressman said. Captain Gilk said the terrain flattened out ''significantly west of the ridge'' that the plane hit. **********Both Ethiopian and American officials said the pilot of the Twin Otter, a plane used frequently on bush flights in Ethiopia, was experienced and had an excellent reputation. The United States charge d'affaires, Robert G. Houdek, who said he had flown with the pilot, Colonel Assefa Gibre-Giorgis, many times, described him as ''the best bush pilot'' in the country. **********Mr. Leland, who was on his sixth trip to Ethiopia and his second this year, arrived in Addis Ababa the night before the crash. He had been at another refugee camp, at Asossa, north of Fugnido near the Sudanese border, in April. He was apparently eager to inspect the Fugnido camp in part because half the 50,000 refugees there are orphaned boys who struggled across southern Sudan into Ethiopia last year to avoid the civil war and resulting famine.

But it extends by implication to the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Swapo Assails U.N. Official **********Anton Lubowski, a white lawyer who is a member of Swapo's secretariat, said at a news conference in Windhoek, Namibia, today that Mr. Ahtisaari should be replaced immediately, saying the United Nations had mishandled the Namibian transition, The Associated Press reported. **********The criticism from the third world has angered and alarmed many United Nations officials and Western diplomats here. They say they see many charges as unfair or relating to problems of the Africans' own making. **********But they also say the controversy means that one of the largest peace-making operations the United Nations has ever tried is off to a shaky start. **********A basic difficulty, these officials say, is that the nonaligned movement has already recognized the Namibian guerrilla group as the ''sole authentic representative of the Namibian people'' and wants it to win the November elections. The United Nations, on the other hand, must insure that the elections are free and fair. **********The movement's most bitter reproach is that Mr. Ahtisaari authorized South African forces to leave the camps where they were supposed to be confined from April 1 to fight guerrillas Pretoria said had infiltrated Namibia in violation of the accords. **********On Thursday the movement described itself as ''outraged'' by Mr. Ahtisaari's decision. **********The guerrillas, it said, were exercising the right they share with South Africa's forces to be confined in camps inside Namibia under United Nations guard until independence. **********The nonaligned movement criticized the United Nations for failing to get all its forces to Namibia by April 1 as planned, saying it should have delayed the start of the independence plan if the troops were not ready. **********They also asked the Secretary General to reverse last month's Security Council decision cutting the force from 7,500 to 4,500 men to save money. **********Many Western diplomats see the nonaligned movement's stand as an attempt to cover up a tactical mistake by Swapo, which they believe was trying to infiltrate forces into Namibia while the South African troops were confined to barracks and before the United Nations force was fully in place. The Pluses of Infiltration **********Successful infiltration would have enabled the guerrillas to appear the victor in its fight with South Africa and win support before the election. It would also have left Swapo with an armed presence when the peacekeeping forces leave. **********United Nations officials assert that Swapo has no right to military bases in Namibia under the independence accords and that its forces in Angola may only return unarmed through designated entry points.

Morrison, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, said the disparity between the proposed number of refugee admissions and the Administration's budget request made him wonder if Mr. Bush was ''really serious'' about admitting 125,000 refugees. **********In addition, Mr. Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat, said: ''The world has changed dramatically in Eastern Europe. But this proposal for refugee admissions reflects an attitude of business as usual.'' **********Mr. Bush's plans are set forth in a report titled ''Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 1990,'' which will be the subject of at least four Congressional hearings later this week. **********The report comes at a time when the number of refugees around the world has reached a record level of 14 million and many countries have adopted more restrictive admissions policies. **********The Administration said it planned to admit 6,500 refugees from Eastern Europe, the same number allowed to come this year.

It would not review applications outside Moscow for any people who left the Soviet Union on Israeli visas issued after a certain date. The date could be as early as Sept. 30.  After that date, Soviet applicants for Israeli visas would be told that they should apply to the American Embassy in Moscow if their ultimate destination was the United States.

Twenty-five thousand Indochinese, mostly Vietnamese and Laotians, would come to the United States from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and other places where they have found temporary asylum.

Mr. Kesner noted that since legislation allowing them was passed in 1982, their number and influence have grown steadily. **********One embryo BID embraces the Metrotech area in downtown Brooklyn, where three large colleges and commuter and communications companies are seeking to broaden the concept. **********''We are looking forward to the time when the Metrotech BID will play a major role in offering day care to workers in our area, as well as programs that would help train people to both operate and maintain such equipment as word processors and computers,'' said Bob Ohlerking, the acting director of the Metrotech BID. **********One company involved in Metrotech is the Securities Industries Automation Corporation, which is to provide computer services for the New York and American Stock Exchanges and employ 800 workers when its 500,000-square-foot building at Myrtle Avenue and Lawrence Street opens about a year from now. **********Mr. Ohlerking also noted that Nynex has two large buildings within the Metrotech BID boundaries, at 360 Bridge Street and 101 Willoughby Street, that are scheduled to be used to train 40,000 management and technical workers a year in the 1990's. **********In addition, it is hoped that the Metrotech BID will provide extra street and sidewalk cleaning, put up holiday lighting and other seasonal promotions, and provide assistance to merchants on signs and window displays. **********Mr. Ohlerking said he expected that the budget of the Metrotech BID would be about $2.2 million in its first full year, which might be as early as 1991. It takes an average of three years to create a BID, according to officials of the city's Office of Economic Development. **********Jack Rainey, the city official in charge of fostering the BID's, noted that under local law a plan for a BID requires about a year to educate merchants and property owners on the value of the concept and how the assessments would be used. Legally, 51 percent of the property owners and merchants in a proposed BID must agree to join before the district can be established. In practice, however, the founders seek 90 percent agreement. **********Once the BID is created, the assessments take on the legal force of taxes on all property owners and businesses in the area. The assessments are based either on the value of commercial buildings or on the business generated by their tenants. Yearly assessments average $350. **********The next step is at least a year of approval processes, during which public hearings are held and the proposal is reviewed by the City Planning Commission, the Board of Estimate, the State Comptroller and the City Council. Then it takes about a year to carry out the plan agreed upon by the property owners, often with a small amount of start-up funds from the city. **********Mr. Rainey said that at times there had been local opposition to the creation of a BID, in some cases by residents who believed erroneously that such municipal services as street cleaning would be reduced if an improvement district was created. **********''What we're trying to do is supplement services, not reduce them,'' Mr. Rainey said. He added that in the 1960's and 70's there had been a decline in interest in community improvement almost citywide, in part because of changes in neighborhood social patterns, and that this had undermined local interest in improvements.

You see, interest rates are behaving differently.Normally, long-term interest rates peak after the economy has headed into recession. But long-term rates peaked in April when the economy was still positive.  Leif H. Olsen  President, economist, Leif Olsen Assoc. **********Both the housing sales and starts numbers are consistent with an economy that is heading for slower growth. But we don't know how slow. The whole household area is sluggish. This includes automobiles, household durables, construction and so on. The question of whether we have a recession is still problematic. No one knows. But the economy has not leveled off yet; it is still slowing. **********Housing is quite important because of the accessory purchases that go along with it. Housing has a ripple effect throughout the entire economy. It leads the economy into recessions and it leads the economy in recoveries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/world/london-journal-in-the-midnight-streets-shepherding-the-destitute.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1989-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "London Journal; In the Midnight Streets, Shepherding the Destitute", "print_headline": "London Journal; In the Midnight Streets, Shepherding the Destitute", "body_text": " **********As night crept toward dawn, hundreds of people walked along the city streets in search of despair. **********They found it in the forbidding alleys and dark doorways where homeless men and women huddle. They found it, too, in both clear-eyed accounts and disoriented recollections of members of the army whose only address is the street. **********Nearly 400 volunteers carried out the search in the first phase of a wide-ranging project to define the problem of homelessness in London and develop ways to ease it. The two-year study, sponsored by the Salvation Army and conducted by the University of Surrey, is to examine the attitudes, backgrounds and environments of homeless people on the streets and in hostels, bed-and-breakfast hotels and unoccupied buildings. **********David Canter, who is coordinating the project as head of the university's department of psychology, said a major weakness of past studies was their tendency to focus on broad economic issues. In the Salvation Army project, Mr. Canter is taking account of the experiences and perspectives of the homeless - they will take part in group discussions and interviews - in developing suitable programs. Differing Attitudes **********''Some people feel they have hit rock bottom, while others feel their homelessness is a temporary stage,'' Dr. Canter said. ''That has to be taken into account when developing facilities. Someone who thinks it's short-term is not going to want structured settings or to be treated like an institutional inmate. Someone who feels he's at rock bottom may want to rely on others for a while to gather his personal resources. **********''Our starting point with the homeless is to realize that they are making a choice, whether it be to sleep alone or with others in a hostel or on the street. These are people who are trying to cope and make sense of the world as best they can. Any facility has to build from that rather than take a hierarchical do-gooder approach of deciding what is best for them and then discovering that many homeless people don't want what you think is best for them.'' **********The other night, volunteers looked for the homeless in roughly half of Greater London, from Heathrow Airport to the heart of the financial district. They were given maps showing specific areas to search and instructed to record where they found people sleeping, along with any details they could gather about ethnicity, state of health and surroundings. Project officials cautioned them against being intrusive, comparing their mission to walking into someone's bedroom. The volunteers were not to wake up anyone but to ask those who were willing to talk such questions as where they usually slept at night and what events led to their sleeping on the street. **********A group of five volunteers studied their map under a street light and then searched parks, staircases and other dark nooks and crannies. They went to Victoria Station, where travelers waited for late-night trains and the homeless just waited. They spread out and spoke gently to those they found, including a woman who gave her age as 91 and a man who said he was a former lawyer. **********One woman, surrounded by dirty, bulging shopping bags, said she never stayed in hostels because she did not ''believe in that way of life.'' Another woman said she had tried to get a bed in a shelter but had been turned away because there was no room. Their Numbers Are Not Known **********One volunteer, Maj. Katherine Foreman of the Salvation Army, strode toward a disheveled man as he shuffled down the street and pulled a soiled blanket around his shoulders. Startled and apprehensive, he quickly took two steps back. But she spoke reassuringly and he moved closer and told her that he usually spent his nights walking the streets or riding buses. **********No one knows how many people are homeless in London or Britain as a whole. The figure generally used to show the extent of the problem is the number of households accepted as homeless by the local authorities, who are responsible for housing families with dependent children, elderly people, pregnant women and the physically and mentally disabled. **********Shelter, an organization that works with the homeless, said there were 128,345 such households in Britain in 1987, representing roughly 370,000 people. But it said that the figure excluded many groups, notably most single homeless people, and that the true number was ''in the millions.'' **********The organization said the number of homeless households practically doubled from 1979, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to power, to 1987. With the Thatcher Government sharply reducing the capital funds available for local governments to build new public housing for the poor and encouraging the open-market sale of existing units, the number of available new housing units has declined to 15,000 from 70,000 in 1979, a housing specialist in the opposition Labor Party said. **********According to Government statistics published in 1987, 41 percent of households recognized as homeless had parents, relatives or friends who could not accommodate them, while 18 percent were homeless because their relationship with their partner broke down. Ten percent were homeless because they fell behind in mortgage payments, representing what housing specialists say is a fast-growing category, as people fall into arrears because of rising interest rates. **********''London is a gathering place for the homeless,'' said Maj. Jorge Booth of the Salvation Army. ''There are youngsters who've run away from home, husbands or wives who left home after a row and people wandering around because they have no work, no place, no hope. We must know who these people are so that we can offer them the best help we possibly can.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/world/leland-s-body-to-come-home.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leland's Body to Come Home", "print_headline": "Leland's Body to Come Home", "body_text": " **********The bodies of Representative Mickey Leland of Texas and eight other Americans killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia on Aug. 7 will arrive in the United States on Wednesday, Ethiopian and American officials said today.

And they were giving them to the people of America. **********Variations of this scene have been repeated in the glittery reception hall for the last two weeks as part of a national fund-raising campaign intended to pay off the $183 million debt Liberia owes the United States. **********American officials had warned that unless Liberia tended to its obligations, the unique bonds between the two countries would be strained and aid severed. Liberian officials countered with an unprecedented offer: they would pay their debt, not from Government coffers but from the pockets of citizens. What Friends Do **********''America has been a true and good friend,'' said Mary Shaw, a 37-year-old seamstress, one of several thousand ordinary people who, Liberian officials say, have contributed to the campaign. ''We owe them money and we ought to pay it.'' **********There are some who say that the contributions are not entirely voluntary, that some employers have used subtle coercion to get their workers to contribute. **********There are also complaints that the fund-raising campaign is a way for the Doe Administration to shift the focus away from its own mismanagement and financial sleight of hand. As a businessman put it, ''We all know where a lot of those American dollars went - they're lining the pockets of some of the very officials who are now asking us to contribute money.'' **********Asked if he would contribute to the campaign, the businessman replied, ''Sure, we still owe the money.'' **********Since 1946, the United States has given this country more than $800 million in aid and loans, making Liberia the largest per-capita recipient of American aid in sub-Saharan Africa. But last month, citing several loans that had been in arrears for more than a year, American officials said that unless they received a payment of at least $7 million by May 10 they would be required under United States law to cut Liberia off from further economic or military aid. **********The ultimatum at first stunned Liberian officials, in part because this nearly bankrupt nation of two million people is the closest that the United States has ever had to a colony on the African continent. In 1822, freed American slaves began to settle in the area. A quarter of a century later, they established the first independent republic in Africa, with a red, white and blue flag but only one star. Capital Named for Monroe **********Today, there is a Maryland County and a Virginia River. The police uniforms come from the New York City Police Department, and the principal currency is the United States dollar. The capital is named after President James Monroe in gratitude for the American money that helped finance the colony. **********In the campaign to pay off its present-day debt to the United States, the Government unleashed lots of official enthusiasm. On nearly every major thoroughfare there are billboards and posters with slogans like ''For Dignity and Respect, Let's Pay the U.S.A.'' **********Improbably perhaps, the United States Embassy here seems to be one of the institutions that has little to say about the fund-raising drive. Ambassador James K. Bishop and his chief deputies declined to be interviewed for this article.  [ In Washington, a State Department official said he was aware of Liberia's fund-raising efforts. ''It's up to the Government of Liberia to decide how it's going to pay its debts,'' the official said. ]  Other United States officials here said they were concerned about what they regarded as anti-American posturing by some Liberian officials. **********In a speech last week, the Liberian President, Gen. Samuel K. Doe, said, ''In my mind, I think it is America that owe us; we don't owe them.'' And in an aside, he added, ''I think the only thing America has not done to me is to shoot my plane down.'' **********In an interview, Information Minister J. Emmanuel Bowier said the campaign was not anti-American. **********''We are saying our relationship goes beyond money,'' he said. ''But if after 130 or 140 years the U.S. will look at us and say, if you don't pay down to the last brass copper, we will pull out and close down everything, then we know now that for them, a relationship, a friendship has a monetary value, has a dollar sign.'' **********He also pointedly noted that the United States has extensive interests here, including a Voice of America radio transmitter, communications equipment and landing rights for American military aircraft. ''We're going to look at all those investments and decide what to do with them,'' Mr. Bowier said.  But some Liberians warn that the campaign could backfire, especially if the Government is unable to raise the $7 million. So far, Government officials say, the campaign has raised about $4.5 million. ''Let's face it, who else will give us the quantity of aid the Americans have given us,'' said Edward K. Kesselly, the leader of Liberia's Unity Party and a frequent critic of the Government. **********Mr. Bowier insists that Liberia is able to meet its obligations. ''The $7 million will be there,'' he said. ''And if the U.S. wants to pull out, let them pull out. We will pay our debts, and we will prove to them that Liberia is a sovereign country.

Williamsburgh, whose headquarters building is a landmark in downtown Brooklyn, will be merged into Manhattan Savings, also a profitable operation with $2.8 billion of deposits. **********Republic, the nation's 26th-largest banking company, currently has $16.8 billion in deposits, including Williamsburgh. One of the world's largest traders in the gold market, Republic does not lend actively to businesses, preferring to invest depositors' money in short-term securities. That philosophy helps keep expenses down but limits the amount of interest the bank can earn on its investments. Republic Started in 1966 **********A relative newcomer to the New York market, Republic was started in 1966 by Edmond J. Safra, who today owns 33 percent of the company's stock and is in close contact with the bank's senior officers, although he holds no official position. Mr. Safra, a Brazilian citizen of Lebanese descent, is now developing Safra Republic Holdings, a bank-holding company catering to wealthy clients in Europe and Asia, following the successful formula he used in building the Trade Development Bank, which he sold to the American Express Company in 1983. **********''The addition of Manhattan Savings will allow us to keep a diversified mix of deposits, with about one-third from retail accounts in the New York region, one-third from the private banking group and one-third institutional,'' said Jeffrey C. Keil, president of Republic. **********The private banking group referred to by Mr. Keil accepts deposits from wealthy individuals, many of them in foreign countries, who are attracted by Republic's financial strength and by Mr. Safra's reputation. Deposits in the private banking group, which average about $400,000 per account, are growing by more than 20 percent a year. **********Although the 139-year-old Manhattan Savings Bank is in good shape financially, it is not well positioned to compete with much larger banks in the New York area. Consequently, Mr. Keil said, Manhattan executives, after an initial ''polite but cool'' response to the merger proposal, warmed to the idea as they realized how a larger, more experienced parent company could help them develop services like automated teller machines and credit cards. Republic, in turn, will get Manhattan's low-cost deposit base. Wave of Mergers Predicted **********John A. Pancetti, chairman of Manhattan, who will retain that position after the merger with Williamsburgh, predicted that as interstate banking is allowed, ''there is going to be a wave of mergers in the banking industry, and we would be subject to a hostile takeover without an ability to choose our partner.'' **********Manhattan depositors will be given the right to buy about 4.5 million Republic shares at the lower of $44.69 a share or the price of Republic stock at the time of offering, with a guaranteed minimum purchase of at least 100 shares. Proceeds of that stock sale, and a public offering of any of shares not bought by Manhattan depositors, will be added to Republic's capital base and used to expand Manhattan business. **********The announcement came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Republic stock ended at $48.375, down 87.5 cents. Analysts estimated that the Manhattan acquisition could increase Republic's earnings by more than 25 cents a share. In 1990, they estimate earnings at $5.25 to $5.80 a share, not counting the acquisition of Manhattan. **********Manhattan, which specializes in loans backed by existing apartment and office buildings, is expected to earn about $20 million this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/15/business/company-news-higher-rebates-due-from-gm.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Higher Rebates Due From G.M.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Higher Rebates Due From G.M.", "body_text": " **********Two weeks after participating in the automobile industry's last round of incentives, the General Motors Corporation raised the cash rebates it offers on some of its cars and light trucks.

Italy has already offered $115 million toward the expected $365 million cost of creating a more normal life for Central American refugees. **********But the conference will also urge Central American governments and refugee agencies to pay greater attention to the many so-called internally displaced people driven from their homes by violence and natural disasters. Many of these do not qualify as refugees under current international law and as a result often receive scant help from international aid agencies. A Model for Others **********The proposed strategy is seen by experts as a model for dealing with many of the world's more than 20 million refugees as other conflicts are brought to an end. **********''At Guatemala we hope to create a model for dealing with the refugee crises in Africa and elsewhere, which involves replacing emergency relief with projects to incorporate refugees into national development,'' Jean-Pierre Hocke, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a recent inteview at his Geneva headquarters. **********The present international machinery for dealing with refugees, essentially comprising the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and a convention defining the rights of refugees, dates from the 1950's when international concern was focused on the plight of Europeans left homeless by the World War II and the spread of Communism in Eastern Europe. The 1951 Convention, for example, defines refugees in essentially cold-war terms, saying they must have fled to another country to escape ''a well-founded fear of persecution.'' **********Today, most refugees are in the developing world and are victims of violence and natural disasters, not ideological persecution. Many Get No Help **********While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with an annual budget of some $600 million, accepts responsibility for caring for about 12 million refugees, up to 14 million more do not qualify for its help, usually because they have been displaced within their own country, according to the Refugee Policy Group, a private American organization based in Washington. **********Various efforts to liberalize the definition of a refugee have been made over the years. But the major Western governments refuse to change the mandate of the United Nations High Commissoner for Refugees or the 1951 Convention, fearing an influx of third world migrants in search of a better life. **********Instead, they argue that those made homeless by civil wars are the responsibility of the Red Cross, though governments are often reluctant to let it operate in areas of conflict. **********The proposed new policy seeks to break through these constraints by shifting the emphasis away from humanitarian relief toward treating refugees as part of their host country's development process. **********It does this by urging the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to cooperate with the United Nations Development Program, an aid-giving organization, in developing economic projects that will provide employment for refugees, for those who elect to return home and for internally displaced people, instead of confining them to camps. Some Governments Resist **********United Nations officials concede their proposals are controversial with some governments. In Honduras, for instance, refugee workers report that the military authorities distrust refugees from El Salvador and Nicaragua, whom they see as potential troublemakers, and keep them in guarded camps. **********The success of the plan therefore depends on a relaxation of tensions within the region, making it easier for refugees and internally displaced people to return home voluntarily or to be accepted into the local communities. **********Officials stress that the Guatemala conference is an integral part of the Central American peace process approved by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The agreement calls for urgent attention to be given to refugees and internally displaced people. **********Prolonged strife and civil war in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala have forced two million people to abandon their homes over the past decade, according to estimates of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. **********About 140,000 certified refugees are currently being helped by the international community. But over six times that number have fled their countries for reasons similar to those of the refugees, although they have not registered as refugees and are mostly living illegally in neighboring countries. **********In addition, 870,000 have been displaced within their own countries.

Chissano has emerged from the party congress of his ruling Mozambique Liberation Front, which concluded its work Sunday, with a mandate to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the brutal insurgency that has devastated Mozambique. **********A position paper issued by the party congress stipulates that the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, known as Renamo, must agree to renounce violence and support constitutional rule before negotiations can begin. It has not asked the rebels to lay down their arms first. **********Mozambique's Foreign Minister, Pascoal M. Mocumbi, said that the climate seemed favorable for a peace agreement. ''We are prepared to engage in dialogue once the conditions of the Government are met,'' he told journalists. But there was still no indication when direct negotiations would start. **********Renamo, which claims to have 22,000 guerrillas, agreed at its own congress early in June to respond to earlier peace overtures by Mr. Chissano, and Mozambican church leaders have informally contacted the rebels. But the guerrilla leadership failed to appear at a scheduled meeting with the churchmen in Nairobi this month, and other obstacles remain to a peace agreement in the war, which has drained Mozambique's human and economic resources for a decade. What Role for Rebels?  Some Mozambican officials and foreign diplomats question whether Renamo is ready to end the war, whether it can restrain its widely dispersed fighters and what postwar role, if any, would be given Renamo, which has been accused of repeated atrocities. **********Although it was not on the formal agenda, President Chissano's readiness to talk to the insurgents, which last year he swore he would never do, dominated much of the debate at the party congress. The party - the Mozambique Liberation Front, or Frelimo - has governed Mozambique since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975. **********Mr. Chissano told the congress last week that a ''national consensus'' was needed to end the war, and the party program approved Sunday drops nearly all the old Marxist-Leninist language and presents Frelimo as a party for all Mozambicans. The resolution affirms support for Mr. Chissano's efforts to bring about ''a dignified peace'' that ''does not constitute a prize for terrorism,'' a reference to Renamo's guerrilla operations. **********Most sessions of the congress were closed to reporters, but some details emerged of a delegates' debate over whether Frelimo should talk to a guerrilla movement it has long branded as ''bandits'' and stooges of South Africa. Horror Stories Abound **********The Renamo insurgents, who claim to be fighting for democracy and other Western values, have become notorious for murder, torture, kidnapping, and rape throughout Mozambique. By some accounts, Renamo has killed 100,000 civilians and turned 1.6 million more people - of a total population of 15 million - into refugees. They have hacked off ears and limbs, and stolen everything they could force their surviving captives to carry. **********In one raid on the Maputo suburb of Khonholote last Monday night, after the Frelimo congress opened, the guerrillas reportedly mutilated four civilians, including a 62-year-old woman and an 8-year-old girl, and abducted a 12-year-old girl. **********Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia have agreed to act as brokers between the Mozambican Government and the rebels. Mr. Kaunda, who addressed the congress on Friday, urged that the Government talk to Renamo's leaders ''and find out what they think they are doing to themselves and to their brothers and sisters, and on whose command they are doing it.'' **********Mr. Chissano, in pressing the case for negotiations, also emphasized a need for reconciliation. ''We are going to reach into the minds of the Renamo chiefs. We are going to save them from the clutches of those who control them,'' the official Mozambique Information Agency quoted him as telling the delegates. **********Both leaders alluded to a lingering question: whether South Africa, which began backing Renamo in 1980, still gives it clandestine aid. Mr. Chissano said two weeks ago that he accepted the South African Government's assurance that its military was no longer helping the guerrillas. But he said they were still getting supplies from ''elements'' in South Africa. Deftly Shifts Position **********President Chissano, who insisted as recently as last December that ''the people will not allow us to talk to murderers,'' has carefully prepared for the negotiations he proposes. **********In January 1988, he offered an amnesty to Renamo guerrillas. About 3,000 turned themselves in, and the amnesty was renewed this year. **********The Mozambican leader also cultivated better relations with South Africa, telling Pretoria that a stable Mozambique was in its political and economic interests. He further sought the support of other African leaders for negotiations with the Renamo insurgents, who are still widely viewed in the region as surrogates of South Africa. **********Last year, Mr. Chissano secretly let Roman Catholic and Protestant bishops into Mozambique to sound out rebel representatives about their movement's willingness to negotiate. **********A solution is far from assured. When a journalist asked Foreign Minister Mocumbi last week whether Renamo's leaders would get places in the Frelimo Government, Mr. Mocumbi replied only that it was not an issue to discuss at a news conference."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/25/world/swapo-leader-asks-whites-help.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 449, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swapo Leader Asks Whites' Help", "print_headline": "Swapo Leader Asks Whites' Help", "body_text": " **********More than 50,000 people filled Windhoek's main stadium today to hear Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South-West Africa People's Organization, urge the white minority to join in the Namibian independence process.

Both of the declines were widely expected. **********Dealers said the credit markets were continuing to wait for clear signals from the Federal Reserve about the direction of interest rates.  Earlier Battering Cited **********''The Street is still licking its wounds from the battering it took earlier in the week, when many convinced themselves that the Fed was about to slash interest rates,'' said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. ''Now everyone wants to see a clear signal from the Fed before taking on new positions.'' **********The Fed again indirectly added $1.5 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system yesterday, but this, too, was expected. Mr. Chandross noted that payment for the $8 billion of 62-month Treasury notes auctioned on Wednesday was settled yesterday. The $10 billion of two-year notes sold Tuesday was settled on Thursday, when the Fed also added funds to the banking system. **********''Aside from such reserve requirements, we can expect the Fed to add modest amounts of reserves each day this month to accommodate credit needs during the Christmas season,'' he continued. ''These infusions have little, if any, bearing on Fed interest rate policy.''  Funds Rate at 8 7/16% **********The Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans, traded at 8 7/16 percent late in the day, after trading at 8.5 percent for most of the session. The funds rate is roughly a quarter-point above its level of a week ago; many traders believe that the level a week ago had convinced the market that the Fed would soon cut the discount rate. The same credit market analysts are now saying that the target for the funds rate is 8.5 percent. **********Still, the consensus among market analysts is that the current level of interest rates is not sustainable because a weakening economy reduces the demand for credit. Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu, noted early last week that while big banks were posting a prime lending rate of 10 1/2 percent, competing 90-day commercial paper rates were just under 8.25 percent. Indeed, more and more commercial borrowers with sound credit ratings now bypass banks, preferring to issue and roll over short-term commercial paper. **********Meanwhile, the traditional yield curve has been restored. For example, the discount rate on 90-day Trasury bills fell 8 basis points, to 7.53 percent; six-month bills lost 5 basis points, to 7.35 percent, and one-year bill rates were down 5 basis points, to 7.15 percent. **********Also in late trading, the benchmark Treasury long-term bond, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, was offered at 102 27/32, up 5/32 on the day. The long-term bond's yield eased to 7.87 percent, from 7.88 percent Thursday, but was 1 basis point above the level of a week ago. The Treasury's long-term notes, the 7 7/8's of 1999, gained 5/32, at 100 16/32, for a yield of 7.80 percent. **********Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 7.75 percent two-year notes rose 3/32, to 100 4/32, for a yield of 7.68 percent. This compared with the average yield of 7.78 percent produced when the notes were auctioned on Tuesday. The price of the 7.75 percent five-year notes auctioned Wednesday rose 5/32, to 100 7/32, for a yield of 7.69 percent. The average yield on the five-year notes at the auction was 7.77 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/world/from-coke-to-marlboro-us-takes-hold-in-china.html": {"writer_name": "Fox Butterfield", "pub_date": "1989-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1000, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From Coke to Marlboro, U.S. Takes Hold in China", "print_headline": "From Coke to Marlboro, U.S. Takes Hold in China", "body_text": " **********In front of a glass-enclosed display case outside the American Consulate here, clusters of Chinese gather silently to read material that the Chinese Government has demanded be removed.

''I want to make clear to the Chinese leaders that the United States denounces the kind of brutality that all of us witnessed on television,'' reads one passage by the President. **********The display case and the dispute over it is only one sign that while the American presence in Shanghai is small, United States influence here is potentially far-reaching. **********''Much of what happens now in China depends on the United States,'' said a young Chinese official displaying a widespread if exaggerated attitude. He is working on the construction of Shanghai Center, a $175 million three-tower group of buildings designed by John Portman, the Atlanta-based architect, that dominates the old skyline of Shanghai and is the biggest real estate development project in China. 'There Is an Alternative' **********''If Americans leave, then other foreigners will leave and we will be in trouble,'' the official said. ''The Cultural Revolution only happened because we didn't know anything different. We thought it was right. Now we have learned about the outside world, and we know there is an alternative.'' **********American influence ranges from the obvious to the subtle, all of it unimaginable a decade ago, before Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, began his market-oriented economic changes and opened China to the outside world. **********There is the abundance of American consumer goods, a sign of the new materialism that has replaced Maoist collectivism. Small shops all over Shanghai have soda foutains dispensing Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Sprite and Fanta orange, often in paper cups with the drinks' logos in English. Marlboro cigarettes are popular, and a large color ad featuring a Marlboro man rounding up horses dominates a department store window on Nanjing Road, the major shopping street. **********After the main evening news on China's central television one recent night, largely devoted to elderly Communist leaders excoriating ''bourgeois liberalism'' for causing the pro-democracy movement, there was an ad for Maxwell House coffee. ''American coffee, for the good life,'' a voice said. Major U.S. Investments **********Then there are major American investments in Shanghai, upgrading China's technology and infusing capital. McDonnell Douglas is helping a actory produce 25 MD-82 jetliners, a two-engine, wide body aircraft for domestic use in China. A decade ago, the Shanghai factory tried to copy a Boeing 707 on its own. The plane was flawed and never got off the ground. **********The Xerox Corporation has invested $15 million in a $30 million joint venture with a Chinese enterprise to manufacture photocopiers, in what Xerox hopes will become a much larger production facility to capture the China market. **********The Portman project will not only provide Shanghai's tallest building, a 50-story hotel, it is also transforming habits dulled by years of welfare socialism in which it did not matter how hard or well an employee worked. **********''When Chinese secretaries first come to work for us we find they spent most of their time drinking tea, just like in a Chinese office,'' said Patsy Whitcomb, the public relations director for the Portman project. 'Suddenly Working Hard' **********''They type very slowly, maybe 15 words a minute, and they let the phone ring 20 times before they pick it up,'' Mrs. Whitcomb added. ''The ashtrays stay full and never get emptied. They don't understand why we work till 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. They always leave exactly at 5.'' **********''But after a month being around us, they are suddenly working hard,'' she said. ''They can see what being productive accomplishes.'' **********The elegant new 43-story Shanghai Hilton Hotel is subversive in another way that poses a threat to the Communists' carefully organized control apparatus, which is based on the danwei, or work unit. **********Until very recently, every Chinese belonged to a work unit, usually for life. It gave people not only their jobs, but assigned them housing and doled out essential ration coupons for grain, cooking oil and meat. When Chinese want to get married or have a child, they must normally go through their unit for permission. Units are where political study sessions take place, and each unit maintains a secret dossier on every member that includes any derogatory information from confidential informants. Independent of China **********But the Hilton, which is 100 percent foreign-owned - by a group of Hong Kong Chinese investors and Hilton International - is independent of any Chinese organization. To find employees, instead of waiting for the city labor bureau in normal Chinese fashion, the Hilton advertised in a local paper and then rented the Shanghai Stadium for four days to handle the thousands of applicants, said Onie Chu, the public relations manager. Instead of keeping political dossiers, the Hilton rates its 1,400 Chinese employees twice a year on their work performance. **********''We have to explain performance to them, they don't understand at first,'' said Miss Chu, whose family originally came from Shanghai. ''In their units, everyone got the same pay regardless of performance, so they find it hard to accept that some waitresses make more than others.'' **********Many young Chinese, now able to watch American movies and television programs, have an idealized view of the United States. ''America is heaven,'' said a sales clerk in a privately owned boutique selling imported Western shoes and dresses. **********''Everybody is rich there,'' she said. ''Here, everybody is poor.

Moreover, Seoul has itself become a foreign aid donor to a World Bank affiliate that lends to the poorest countries. **********Mr. Bovard's reference to a ''confidential'' report on adjustment lending to African countries has actually been available to the public since last December.

In Mexico and elsewhere, state-owned companies have been closed or sold, and public employee salary increases have been curtailed. **********Finally, the piece charges that lending to East European countries has ''gone to finance the usual priorities of the Communist governments.'' This ignores the distinctive features shaping each borrowing country's relationship with the Bank. Lending to Yugoslavia has tapered off because policy agreements have not been reached.

W. de Klerk, some black leaders have begun jockeying for the tacit right to take part in any future negotiations with the white-minority Government on behalf of South Africa's black majority. **********The African National Congress, which has been outlawed since 1960, has long claimed to speak for the country's 28 million blacks from its headquarters in exile in Lusaka, Zambia. Last month, a rally at a soccer stadium near Soweto, held to welcome home seven newly released political prisoners, attracted a crowd estimated at 70,000 to 80,000, which gave rousing support to the congress as the legitimate voice of black South Africans. **********On Sunday, King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi attracted another crowd of perhaps 75,000 Zulus at a rally of their political movement, Inkatha, in Durban. The Zulu King complained that he and Chief Buthelezi had not been invited to the homecoming rally, though he contended that they had helped win freedom for Walter Sisulu and the other prisoners. He accused them of excluding the Zulus, who number about six million. Sisulu Replies **********Mr. Sisulu responded on Monday that this was not his intention and accepted in principle an invitation for talks. Such a meeting, he said, would probably discuss how to stop fighting in Natal between supporters of Inkatha and the United Democratic Front, the anti-apartheid umbrella organization linked to the African National Congress. **********Later Monday, the leaders of two popular evangelical church movements, which claim a total membership of seven million blacks, met with President de Klerk in Pretoria. After the two-hour session, Bishop Isaac Mokoena, the life chairman of the Reformed Independent Churches Association, and Archbishop Mzilikazi Masiya, head of the Council for Apostolic and Zion Churches in Southern Africa, who were accompanied by eight fellow clergymen, said they spoke for the ''silent majority'' of peace-loving blacks. **********They criticized other unnamed clergymen who, they alleged, were ''misusing'' their churches for political purposes.

They were also quoted as asking that the emergency-decree rule, in effect since June 1986, not be lifted before those they considered moderate black leaders were consulted. And they reiterated their opposition to Western economic sanctions and disinvestment. De Klerk Recounts Talks **********''They told me that radicalism is representative of a small minority of the total black population and that the vast majority of all black South Africans are striving for moderate solutions, reject violence, and have strong objections to sanctions and boycotts,'' President de Klerk said at a news conference in Pretoria. **********The African National Congress has urged an intensification of sanctions and the withdrawal of foreign investment, and had made the lifting of decree rule one of its conditions for talks with the Government. The Pan-Africanist Congress, a rival group, has urged blacks to boycott the proposed negotiations. **********The recent flurry of activity has shown a wide range of sentiment among South African blacks about the nature of change from apartheid. The degree of support, particularly for the African National Congress, is almost imposssible to measure because emergency rule has stifled unapproved political activity by blacks. **********Mr. de Klerk has said he wants to bring a cross-section of the black majority to the table to negotiate terms of a new constitution that would give blacks more political rights. He has said the African National Congress was welcome if it refrained from violence, though as one of many participants. Supporters of the group believe this amounts to a strategem to limit its influence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/22/business/business-people-baker-hughes-ex-aide-picked-to-lead-levolor.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker-Hughes Ex-Aide Picked to Lead Levolor", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Baker-Hughes Ex-Aide Picked to Lead Levolor", "body_text": " **********The Levolor Corporation, a leading window-covering company, has named a new president and chief executive, John F.

They will remain as directors.  Ms. Claiborne, who will be 60 years old next month, and Mr. Ortenberg, 62, made Liz Claiborne a household name by designing and marketing a line of medium-priced clothing, first for women, then later for men. **********They said in a statement that they intended to pursue a number of environmental, social and other personal interests. **********''The direction of the company will continue to be the same,'' said Harvey L. Falk, the executive vice president of operations and corporate planning. ''They have been planning their succession for a number of years. Their latest roles have been that of consultant and teacher.''New Yorkers Made Good **********Liz Claiborne was a story of two New Yorkers who made good. By 1976, Ms. Claiborne had spent more than 20 years as a designer for other manufacturers, and Mr. Ortenberg had been in the textile industry just as long. Bored, the couple founded Liz Claiborne with $50,000 in savings and $200,000 raised from family, business associates and friends. **********By all accounts, the management savvy came from Mr. Ortenberg, while the creative force was Ms. Claiborne's. She shunned the glamour of couture design or evening wear and concentrated on clothes for professionals. She once described her designs as ''businesslike, but not too pinstripe, more casual, more imaginative, less uptight.'' **********It worked. The company grossed $2.6 million its first year, and when it went public in 1981, net income was $10 million on sales of $117 million. In less than a decade the company, based in Manhattan, became a leading women's apparel manufacturer. Timing was important. Liz Claiborne arrived when large numbers of women were entering the professional ranks.What Liz Says **********What's more, marketing studies by the company showed that American women thought of Ms. Claiborne as a personal friend, one whose taste and judgment they could trust. As one sales manager once said, ''There's a confidence among our customers that if Liz says coral is the color of the season, then they will always look appropriate in coral.'' **********But Liz Claiborne did not rest on its successes. In 1985 it risked venturing into men's clothing, and in recent years the company has added a more extensive line of sportswear, accessories like handbags, belts and scarves, and cosmetics and fragrances. **********The successors to Ms. Claiborne and Mr. Ortenberg will face a challenge. After years of rapid growth, earnings in 1988 were hurt by a slowdown in consumer spending for women's apparel and costs of expanding into retail specialty stores. **********Earnings fell 3.6 percent last year, to $110.3 million, or $1.26 a share, from $114.4 million, or $1.32 a share, in 1987. Sales increased 12.4 percent, to $1.18 billion, from $1.05 billion in 1987. **********In the fourth quarter, earnings increased 18.4 percent, to $26.6 million, or 30 cents a share, from $22.5 million, or 26 cents a share, in the comparable 1987 quarter. Sales increased 21.7 percent to $290.2 million, from $238.4 million the previous year. The company also announced it would raise its dividend in 1989 to 20 cents a share, from 17.5 cents. **********Liz Claiborne stock is trading near its high for the last 12 months of $20. It closed Friday at $18.375, down 37.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading. It has traded as low in $12.75 in the last year.Too Much the Same **********Jeffrey B. Edelman, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, said Liz Claiborne ''has been affected in the same way that all retailers have been affected in the last 18 months: The manufacturers and the retailers were guilty of having too much of the same look for too long.'' **********''Liz Claiborne is a good company,'' he said, ''but there's very little it could with the industry environment so bad.'' **********Mr. Edelman said he doubted the departure of Ms. Claiborne and Mr. Ortenberg would have a significant impact on the company because in recent years they have given increasing responsiblities to subordinates. **********Ms. Claiborne currently holds the titles of chairman, chief executive and president, and Mr. Ortenberg is vice chairman. Neither was at home last night and neither could be reached for comment.Executive Appointments **********The company announced that effective upon their retirement, Jerome A. Chazen, who is also a director, will become chairman, and Mr. Falk will become vice chairman and president. No successor was named as chief executive. **********Mr. Falk, 54, joined the company in 1982 as its chief financial officer and was appointed a director in 1983. He was named exective vice president of finance in 1985 and took his current job in 1985. **********Mr. Chazen, 62, joined Liz Claiborne in 1977 and since then has served as director and in several senior executive jobs, including co-chairman and since 1987 vice chairman. **********In their statement, Ms. Claiborne and Mr. Ortenberg said: ''Our decision to retire is at root a very simple one. After years of working long, long days, and then meeting the new challenges of helping to grow and manage a billion dollar enterprise, we are looking forward to making time to devote to personal interests and to enjoying the fruits of our labor.'' **********Jay Margolis, an executive vice president of the company and president of the women's sportswear group, will be named vice chairman and keep his job with the sportswear group. Mr. Margolis, 40, joined the company in 1984 to head the company's new men's wear division. He was elected a senior vice president in 1985 and was named to his current job with women's sportswear last year.

But residential development on privately owned land is raising concerns that marinas will gradually be replaced by housing, displacing boat owners and fishermen, since the commercial zoning allows residential development. **********The 175-unit Port Rega'lle condominium, an enclave of white stucco houses with red tile roofs at the entrance to the harbor, is the waterfront's first residential project. It is being built on a 21-acre site once occupied by Shoal's Dock, a 375-slip marina. **********A first phase of 65 units, priced at $325,000 to $550,000, was recently completed and is about 80 percent sold. Construction of a second phase of 110 units will begin later this year. The project has a private marina with a 65-slip capacity, but slips cost $1,500 a foot and can be bought and used only by condominium buyers. **********The Port Rega'lle development group, of which Michael Milea of Manhattan is the principal, is planning another project, Regatta Cove, on an adjoining 17-acre parcel, the former site of another marina, Plum Island. The project would offer 164 waterfront units if an application to the Department of City Planning is approved, but it must still undergo extensive reviews because of its waterfront location. **********Waters Edge, which is being developed by Sidney Steinberg and Anthony Clemenza of Brooklyn, does not replace a marina. The 2.5-acre site on Hylan Boulevard, a former vacant lot, adjoins the 1,280-acre Gateway National Recreation Area Great Kills Park. The property has unobstructed views of the harbor, but is separated from the water by Mansion Avenue, a city street, and by privately owned land that is barred from development because it contains wetlands. **********A public foot bridge leading from Fairlawn Avenue, on which Waters Edge also borders, into Great Kills Park is to be built by the developers. The park offers sunbathing, boating and fishing, and a three-mile-long waterfront promenade is planned under a $22 million park improvement plan. Under the plan, an existing marina will be replaced by a new one and expanded to 700 slips. **********The two- and three-bedroom town houses at Waters Edge are a departure from the standard Staten Island town-house development, which is often geared to providing low-cost basic shelter in densely packed rows of attached houses. ''Our concept here is not to build houses on top of each other, but to provide a California-style construction in U-shaped enclaves,'' said Mr. Steinberg, who bought the property a year ago, with approvals in place. **********The units were designed by the late Peter Oddo of Staten Island. The project's new architect, James Di Fiore of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, described the design as seashore-style ''shack'' architecture characterized by simple lines and shed-style roofs. **********The 2,400 square foot units have either three bedrooms, or an unfinished loft that can be turned into a third bedroom, and all have basements. Prices, based on water views and the number of bedrooms, range from $225,000 to $350,000. A swimming pool is planned. Free docking for a boat for one year at a nearby marina is offered. The development, a homeowners association, provides partial tax abatements over an eight-year period. **********Great Kills Harbor falls within the Special South Richmond Development District established in 1975 to help protect natural terrain and vegetation. It requires developers to provide extensive landscaping and to save natural features. At Waters Edge, tree plantings will landscape what is now basically a barren site. At Port Rega'lle, a public walkway runs along the water through a lushly landscaped setting. **********Attached houses in Port Rega'lle's first phase, the design of John Ciardullo of Manhattan, each contain two duplex apartments ranging from 1,500 square feet to 3,000 square feet. The look is that of a Mediterranean seaport village, Mr. Ciardullo said, with houses opening out to private terraces overlooking lawns and flower gardens leading to the water. **********The architect of the project's second phase is Robert Scarano of Staten Island. The new units will have the same overall look, but buildings will be grouped in small enclaves. Units will also be smaller, ranging in size from 1,200 square feet to 2,000 square feet.

And they said the sales reflected the confidence of many advertisers in television, following unsuccessful experiments with other types of promotion. **********The president of the CBS Marketing division, Thomas F. Leahy, said corporate takeovers, combined with a weakened advertising market, had eroded consumer loyalty to brand-name products from cars to toothpaste. ''You build a name by advertising,'' he said. ''What I think we are seeing is a swing back from promotion, which had the lion's share of the ad dollar, back to advertising.'' **********John Reidy, a media analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said companies had recently experimented heavily with promotional devices like coupons and direct marketing, which accounted for as much as 60 percent of their advertising and promotion budgets. But this year, Mr. Reidy said, ''there is a general perception that the pendulum is swinging from promotion to advertising.'' The shift began in the spring, when advertisers tried to buy scatter commercial time and ended up paying 25 to 30 percent more than last year. **********Television sales executives assert that the networks remain the most effective way to reach a mass audience despite the continuing decline of their share of viewers. ''When it came time to put money on the table,'' said H. Weller Keever, the executive vice president for sales at Capital Cities/ ABC Inc., ''people thought the three networks were not the dinosaur they thought they had become.'' **********While the strong upfront sales do not mean there will be any more commercials on television, they do improve the outlook for the broadcast television industry. The networks will almost certainly earn more money next year than had been predicted by media analysts. Affiliated stations, which usually benefit from strong national sales, are also sure to see increased revenues. And unless viewers hate the programs that fill the time between commercials, the sale of the remaining, scatter ads will command higher rates. **********But this year's good fortune may have a downside, said Paul Isacsson, the director of broadcast programming at Young & Rubicam. ''You'll see a backlash by the advertisers next year,'' he said. ''This year, they were disappointed by syndication and they moved back. But they'll return next year and there will be more spillover into cable because it's cheaper.'' **********Nevertheless, it will take more than dire predictions to dampen the spirits that have risen over the current sales. ''It's truly a seller's market in prime time,'' said Paul Schulman, who heads a company bearing his name that buys network time for national advertisers. ''It will be a banner, banner year for all three networks. The money is practically coming in over the transom.'' **********Mr. Schulman said the auto makers were spending 75 to 85 percent more than last year, including $700 million in prime time alone. They have almost exclusively bought programs that promise a large male viewership, like ''Midnight Caller'' and ''In the Heat of the Night'' on NBC and ''Wiseguy'' on CBS, as well as sports events. ''It's a problem because they're directing against a small portion of the inventory, men 18-49 and men 25-54,'' Mr. Isacsson said. ''Scarcity develops quickly'' in the most desired commercial time. **********That scarcity could be a further boon to the networks, which store up some commercial time to give back to advertisers on shows that have disappointing ratings. If those shows perform better than expected, the networks will be free to sell that time later, in a seller's market. **********William G. Moll, the president of the Television Bureau of Advertising, said the strong upfront sales were positive for both the networks and the sponsors. ''It does make something of a statement of the confidence advertisers have in the networks to do the job,'' he said, ''and it says something about the health of the advertisers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/27/business/accounting-merger-talks-called-off.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1989-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 864, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounting Merger Talks Called Off", "print_headline": "Accounting Merger Talks Called Off", "body_text": " **********Arthur Andersen & Company and Price Waterhouse said yesterday that they had abandoned their efforts to create the world's largest accounting firm. The firms would not comment on why they had ended their discussions beyond saying that their ''differences could not be resolved within a realistic time frame.'' **********Nor, say officials of the firms, are they interested in finding other merger partners. The firms had been in formal talks since early July. **********Privately, many ranking partners of Price and Andersen and industry analysts said that the issues separating the firms were just too vast. **********In particular, Andersen objected to the large unfinanced liability that stemmed from the generous benefits that Price assures its partners when they retire. Price, in turn, blamed the regulatory problems that would arise in serving its prestigious auditing clients and those of Andersen Consulting, Andersen's consulting unit, under one firm. **********''They came to their senses,'' said Dr. John C. Burton, a professor of accounting at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business and the former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''This was a merger that seemed to make very little sense. **********''It had problems in terms of the personalities of the firms, the ways the firms are organized and the priorities of the firms,'' Dr. Burton added. ''The firms are to be congratulated in having recognized that.'' **********The decision ends several hectic months for the accounting profession. Several of the nation's largest firms have consolidated resources to compete for multinational clients. Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young formed Ernst & Young in May, while Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross shortly thereafter agreed to form Deloitte & Touche. Ernst & Young Biggest **********Because of the move by Price and Andersen, Ernst & Young is considered the largest accounting firm worldwide, as well as in the United States, according to Accounting Today and Bowman's Accounting Report, two industry publications. Andersen will be the nation's second largest and the fourth worldwide, while Price will be the smallest of the six top-tier firms, by both counts. **********In addition, two midsize accounting firms, Laventhol & Horwath and Spicer & Oppenheim, said over the weekend that they had called off their preliminary merger talks, which began last month. **********Stewart Kahn, a former Andersen partner who now owns a consulting firm, commented on the Price-Andersen move by looking at Coopers & Lybrand, the only big accounting firm that had shunned the merger race. **********''I'm sure the leadership of Coopers are looking at it like they're being vindicated that they did not spend an inordinate amount of time exploring some fruitless merger,'' he said. **********Coopers officials declined to comment on yesterday's decision. Overcoming Clash Seen **********Early on, Andersen and Price maintained that they could overcome the clash in their cultures. For instance, Andersen, which already manages conflicts between its consulting unit and its auditing operations, thought it could do the same for Price's auditing clients. In addition, Andersen, along with the other leading accounting firms, recently petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to amend its rules governing auditors' conflicts of interest. **********Under the commission's rules, an auditing firm cannot do the ventures that Andersen Consulting now does with several computer companies that have auditing clients. Because Price conducts audits for the International Business Machines Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, in the absence of regulatory relief, a combined firm would have had to forgo consulting or auditing work for such clients. **********The S.E.C. is not expected to move quickly enough, if at all, to solve the issue. No Change in Ventures **********''The Andersen consultants were never for this thing,'' said Arthur W. Bowman, the editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. ''They're still the biggest consulting group in the world, and now they don't have to give up their potential joint ventures with I.B.M.'' **********A high-ranking Price official, who asked not to be named, said: ''From our standpoint, it was the regulatory issue. We were unwilling to risk our independence or our relationships with major audit clients.'' **********A top Andersen official, also asking not to be named, agreed that was an issue, but he said he saw it as less of a problem than ''the unrecorded liablity on Price Waterhouse's balance sheet.'' **********Accounting experts consider further merger discussions unlikely at present. **********''There isn't any sort of a logical combination I see now,'' said Dr. Burton, the Columbia professor. ''My guess is there will be quiet for a while.'' **********About two weeks ago, antitrust officials at the Justice Department confirmed that they were investigating large mergers in the accounting industry. But now that Andersen and Price have called off their talks, the department is not expected to object to a profession centered on six primary competitors, the experts said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/21/world/upheaval-china-hong-kong-turns-protest-against-its-once-future-ruler.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Basler", "pub_date": "1989-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 637, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hong Kong Turns Out in Protest Against Its Once and Future Ruler", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN CHINA; Hong Kong Turns Out in Protest Against Its Once and Future Ruler", "body_text": " **********Braving gale-force winds and drenching rains from Typhoon Brenda, demonstrators turned out by the thousands today in Hong Kong and Macao in support of the Beijing student protests, and against the Chinese Government's hard line. **********The Hong Kong Government said that more than 11,000 people massed in Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island, while in Macao, 10,000 marched through the streets calling for freedom in China and condemning the Government's action against protesters. **********A political expert here declared that the demonstrations in both colonies were 'truly amazing.'' **********''These are not places where people take to the streets with their politics,'' he said.

With a national standard in place, the agency could then pre-empt state and local rules. Shift in Prices Expected **********Richard D. Wilson, director of the mobile source office of the E.P.A., said that the Northeast could easily prove that it has a pollution problem that requires action. But the Federal agency may also want to consider the cost of the proposed changes. **********Mr. Wilson said if there was further strain on refining capacity, ''it's more likely to show up in gas prices than in shortages.'' He added that even now, before any new rules take effect, ''everybody agrees that supplies are tight.'' **********''It's clear that supplies will be tight; that's the best case,'' said Mark N. Cohen, a spokesman for the Mobil Corporation. The worst case, he said, would be substantial price increases. But Mr. Cohen and spokesmen for other major oil companies refused to predict what the price change would be. **********Because of strong demand, gasoline prices in the United States have stayed relatively high despite sharply falling prices for crude oil. **********Estimates of what the states' changes in the gasoline rules would cost consumers range from 3 to 25 cents a gallon. The proposed changes have already produced unusual price movements in the gasoline futures markets, where refiners, distributors and retailers hedge their bets about future costs. **********Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist with Charles River Associates, predicted a price jump of up to 25 percent in a matter of weeks. ''Prices may have to be increased to constrain demand,'' he said. **********State officials say the changes would cost 3 cents a gallon or less, and are a far more cost-effective way to cut smog than many anti-pollution measures that have been enforced on factories in recent years. 'The Most Effective Measure' **********''This is by far the most effective measure we have to reduce smog in 1989,'' said Michael J. Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, based in Boston. The group organized the agreement that led to the rules by the eight states. The cost of removing a ton of potential pollutants from gasoline is $500, he said. **********In contrast, he said that environmental officials have often required private industries to spend $5,000 to $10,000 to block a ton of pollutants from sources like metal finishing shops and bakeries. **********At issue is the rule on the so-called volatility of liquid gasoline. Volatility is a measurement of the speed at which liquid gasoline turns to vapor, a quality that is necessary to allow cars to run because engines burn gasoline as a vapor, not a liquid. But volatility contributes to air pollution, because unburned gasoline vapors are a primary ingredient of smog. **********The refining industry quantifies volatility in terms of Reid Vapor Pressure, with higher numbers indicating greater tendency to vaporize. **********A voluntary industry standard limits Reid Vapor Pressure in the Northeast in summer to 11.5 pounds a square inch. (Around the nation, numbers are set higher in winter because smog is seldom a problem then and starting a car in cold weather requires a different blend of gasoline.) But New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont and Massachusetts agreed in November 1987 to cut the Reid pressure to 9. Seven states have passed the rules, which cover the period May 1 to Sept. 15 each year, while New Hampshire is still considering them. **********The Government, meanwhile, is considering a standard of 10.5 pounds, which would require smaller changes than the state rules. **********The states acted together because of the nature of smog, which is produced by the chemical interactions of various ingredients when cooked for hours in the sun, sometimes many miles downwind of the source of the pollutants. **********For example, releases from the urban areas of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have contributed to unhealthy levels of smog in rural Vermont and Maine. Last summer, because of hot, hazy days and increases in gasoline consumption, smog levels set records in the Northeast. Other Problems **********But cutting the Reid pressure causes various problems for refiners, including requiring them to reduce the butane content of gasoline. Refiners like butane, Mr. Bradley said, because it adds volume to the gasoline but costs only about 40 cents a gallon. **********In addition, experts say, butane raises the octane of the gasoline, and octane levels are posing a problem now because lead, another octane raiser, has been banned from most gasoline. In addition, marketing efforts by the oil companies have raised the public's taste for high-octane gasoline. **********For months the oil companies have lobbied at the state level to block the change. Now the American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' main trade group, is suing to stop the rule in New York. **********Massachusetts has in the meantime applied for a guarantee from the E.P.A. that if the agency issues a nationwide rule, Massachusetts will be able to keep its stricter standard. The agency ruled in Massachusetts's favor late last month, after Massachusetts threatened to sue. **********The agency is now waiting out a 30-day comment period before making a final ruling. That ruling appears likely to come only a few days before the regulations of the eight states take effect, on May 1, leaving refiners in doubt as to which standard will apply. **********The oil industry has also been making appeals to the public. Mobil has been contending in newspaper advertisements that raising the Reid Vapor Pressure could make cars harder to start, and would reduce the ability of refiners to make gasoline. **********One way to raise octane without butane is to refine the gasoline more highly. ''It requires 5 percent more crude to make a gallon of low vapor pressure fuel than standard fuel,'' Mr. Cohen, the spokesman for Mobil, said. ''We've got to make up the 5 percent somewhere.'' Ample Oil Supplies **********At the moment, crude oil supplies are ample, but Mr. Cohen said ''the problem is that United States refineries for gasoline are running at 100 percent of capacity, so we've got to get the gasoline from somewhere else.'' **********That means imports, most observers agree, but the availability of imports is not certain. ''I don't think there's really a lot of excess capability in the foreign circuit to meet U.S. gasoline specifications,'' said Raphael H. Beresford, an energy consultant and a former vice president of the Exxon Corporation for worldwide refining and marketing. He noted that the fuel would have to be high-octane and lead-free."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/business/business-people-schindler-has-president-for-its-us-subsidiary.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1989-05-24", "snippet": "LEAD: David J.

In their appeal, Menard-Sanford v. Robins, No. 89-441, these women argued that the Federal bankruptcy law did not give the Federal District Court the authority to bar future lawsuits against the individuals.

In an interview with two reporters yesterday, Mr. Bush said he hoped the Federal Reserve's concern about inflation would not lead the central bank to stifle economic growth by driving up interest rates. **********''If you bought bonds on Tuesday because the Fed was going to be responsible and take a tough anti-inflation stance, Mr. Bush's statements today have to make you a little bit more nervous,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. **********On Tuesday Mr. Greenspan indicated in testimony before the House Banking Committee that the Fed was prepared to push up short-term interest rates to curb inflation. His comments reassured market participants, and helped to spark a healthy rally. Short-Term Rates Rise **********Short-term interest rates did inch higher yesterday, partly because of an upward move in the overnight Federal funds rate. **********Yesterday the funds rate traded in a range of 9 3/8 percent to 9 5/8 percent for much of the day, above the 9 percent to 9 1/8 percent range most analysts assume is the Fed's target range for the funds. **********Analysts noted the slight rise in the funds rate, but said it was associated with record high Treasury balances at the Fed, as well as with pressures associated with the end of a two-week reporting period for banks. They also noted that the Fed was unlikely to push interest rates higher in advance of the Feb. 7-8 meeting of the central bank's Open Market Committee. **********The improvement in prices in the long-term issues continued for a time yesterday, only to deteriorate later. By late in the day, the Treasury's 9 percent bonds that mature in 2018 were offered at a price of 101 27/32, down 7/16, to yield 8.82 percent. During morning trading, yields on the closely watched issue moved as low as 8.75 percent. **********In the secondary Treasury note market, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 99 1/4, down 3/8 of a point, to yield 8.98 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 9/32, down 10/32, to yield 9.03 percent. Two-Year Note Sale **********Much of the selloff occurred after the Treasury sold $9.25 billion worth of two-year notes. The notes were sold at an average yield of 9.08 percent, down from a 9.23 percent average rate at the last two-year note sale in December. Interest from individual investors in the notes was stronger than at the December auction, despite the drop in rates. **********The Treasury received just under $2 billion worth of noncompetitive bids for the notes sold yesterday, up from $1.72 billion in noncompetitive bids at the auction in late December. **********In the Treasury bill market, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at 8.28 percent, up seven basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills were offered at 8.32 percent, up eight basis points. **********Traders said that release of the ''tan book,'' an assessment of economic conditions compiled by the regional Federal Reserve Banks, had little effect on trading. **********The report, which covered activity in the economy from December through early January, ''shows the economy is not slowing down but that price pressures do not seem to be accelerating,'' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********''The banks all seemed to report that we had a good Christmas, and seemed to feel pretty bullish on exports, and that imports are coming down,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc. ''But the market, which remains in a positive mood, didn't make very much out of it.'' **********In other developments, corporate bond prices, which did not rise as much as Treasury issues on Tuesday, posted smaller declines than Government securities yesterday. Dealers said price declines of intermediate and long-term bonds ranged from one-quarter of a point to three-eighths of a point. **********Some mild confusion briefly enveloped the market of outstanding State of California bonds yesterday, following the publication of an article in The Sacramento Bee that said Gov. George Deukmejian's administration would postpone the sale of more than $4 billion in bonds because the state could not afford the principal and interest payments. **********The article was vigorously denied by State Treasury officials, and market makers in California bonds said the report had little impact on prices of outstanding issues. **********''There was never any intention to sell $4 billion worth of bonds,'' said Ken Kramer, assistant state treasurer, in a telephone interview. ''Our 1989 bond calendar is pretty well laid out. Things are pretty much business as usual.'' **********Peck Ferrin, vice president and manager of the municipal bond department at the Bank of America in San Francisco, said the article ''created a little bit of confusion in the secondary market that there will not be enough California paper to trade, but the supply will not be disrupted.'' Convention Center Sells Bonds **********Coincidentally, the reports appeared on a day when the Los Angeles Convention and Exhibition Center sold a $349 million revenue bond issue through the Paine Webber Group. **********The issue consisted of four term bonds with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2021. More than half of the bonds have a maturity of 2018. Those bonds carry a 7 3/8 percent coupon and were priced at $99.25.

In the next phase, these ''rights to pollute''could be bought and sold among companies, and perhaps even to the general public, thus letting the marketplace, rather than the Government, decide the cheapest way to contain smokestack emissions. **********The day may be in sight when an environmental group, for example, could buy utility-pollution rights and then retire them, making the air cleaner through its direct financial action instead of through the political process. Environmental Defense Fund **********Although some elements of the market plan remain undetermined, officials at the E.P.A. and the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group that contributed heavily to the Administration's proposal, today described its workings in some detail. **********During the first five years - the last half of the 1990's - the owners of 107 of the nation's most offensive utility plants would be required to bring their emission levels for sulfur dioxide down to 2.5 pounds per million B.T.U.'s of electricity generated. Sulfur dioxide combines with moisture in the air to produce acid rain. **********The utilities, not the Government, will decide how this should be done. The options include installing scrubbers on coal-fired units and switching fuels. **********Under Phase 1, however, such flexibility would be limited to individual utility systems or states and, while the E.P.A. is studying whether to set up a market in emissions credits at this stage, it would be limited. Governors' Prerogatives **********Another feature of Phase 1 is that a governor would be allowed to override the utility executives in a state by imposing a mechanism for curbing air pollution. This is especially likely, one source said, in states like West Virginia and Ohio where large amounts of coal are both produced and burned. That creates direct conflict in choosing between preservation of mining jobs and higher electric bills for consumers. **********When Phase 2 begins at the turn of the century, the standard would tighten to 1.2 pounds per million B.T.U.'s. Also, 200 to 300 plants would enter the arena, and ''utilities can begin to sell credits to one another'' with little restriction, said Rob Brenner, director of air policy at the E.P.A. ''It's wide open.'' **********Transactions would, however, probably be kept within one of two geographic areas - a 31-state region covering the Eastern states and the ones just west of the Mississippi, and a Western region of the rest of the contiguous states. This distinction is based partly on the prevalence of low-sulfur coal in the West and high-sulfur coal in the East. More than half the nation's electricity is generated from coal. The bulk of the rest comes from nuclear reactors, natural gas and oil. **********The Government, meanwhile, would act not as a stock exchange but as supervisor of an over-the-counter market that would spring up in the private sector. The Government's role would be limited mainly to monitoring the pollution levels and making sure the utilities had acquired sufficient rights for their emissions. It might also print the equivalent of a stock certificate. **********Mr. Brenner said it had not yet been decided whether to give companies credit for plants that initially had better performance than the standard, or what the base would be for measuring improvement. Most likely, however, the base would include 1985, the year for which much information exists. **********Whether outsiders will be allowed to participate is also to be decided, probably within the next few weeks, but the planners seemed to favor the idea. If permitted, environmentalists could buy pollution credits for the purpose of retiring them, forcing down the level of legally permissible air pollution. **********In economic theory, the initial price of pollution rights would be the marginal cost of pollution reduction, or somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 a ton at current prices, one official estimated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/24/business/business-people-wang-laboratories-names-chief-executive.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1989-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wang Laboratories Names Chief Executive", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Wang Laboratories Names Chief Executive", "body_text": " **********Richard W.

''In fact, the protest is basically extremely popular, and, if things go wrong, there would be a chance of heavy strikes.'' **********It is a prospect that China's leaders fear as they try to quell the national wave of unrest. Strike Could Be Crippling **********Other cities in China have daily protest marches of students, cheered on by workers and other citizens. But with more than 11 million people, Shanghai is China's largest city and the country's industrial core. It is also the heart of a region that has ambitious plans to attract huge sums in foreign investments. That combination has long made the country's central authorities nervous about any unrest here. **********A strike in Shanghai, a foreigner here said, would be a calamity for China's entire modernization drive and would throw the economy into turmoil. **********The concern that workers here might react strongly if there were a violent military crackdown on students is one reason cited for the authorities' apparent reluctance to call in troops to clear pro-democracy demonstrators from the center of Beijing. **********''If blood is spilled in Beijing,'' a textile worker said today, ''the workers in Shanghai would mount a general strike.'' **********But it is difficult to know exactly what workers would do if there were a violent crackdown in Beijing. A History of Labor Unrest **********Shanghai has a long pre-Communist history of fierce labor disturbances. It was in this city that the fledgling Communist Party made its first attempt at a conventional revolution by organizing large general strikes of unionized workers. The failure of the Shanghai uprising of 1927 led the party to base the revolution on the peasants, rather than on the workers. **********A similar failure might be in store if a general strike were called in 1989. Though the industrial working class -referred to in China's newspapers as the ''broad laboring masses'' - is large, it is not organized. **********Moreover, some workers in Shanghai say, special efforts have been made lately to keep them at their jobs. In some factories, workers have been warned that if they take time off to demonstrate they will be docked a day's pay, and if they show up for work every day they will get year-end bonuses. **********Still, the Shanghai region has clearly been caught up in the wave of protests sweeping the country. Demonstrations have continued in nearby cities -Wuxi, Yangzhou, Nanjing and others -and have been a daily event here since the beginning of this month. Along the docks on the Huangpu River there is a daily gathering of residents young and old, students and others, many of them massing under the trees in front of the local branch of the Communist Party, a weatherbeaten building of cut stone overlooking the harbor. Banners of Protest **********The area is hung with slogans brushed in black on long strips of white paper. ''The situation is intolerable,'' read one. ''The people's army loves the people,'' said another. A third was, ''Don't be afraid of a crackdown.'' **********There are also daily rallies at the entrance to the small lane that leads to the offices of the World Economic Herald, a bold newspaper shut down last month. Today a banner was strung across the lane proclaiming: ''Comrades, the Economic Herald and the people will always be together.'' **********But the main center of protest is People's Square, a vast asphalt esplanade where the racetrack was during the days when that part of the city was the British concession. There, every afternoon, threading their way through the city's congested shopping streets, come bands of students carrying pennants and banners and demanding, among other things, the resignation of Prime Minister Li Peng. **********On the fringe of the demonstrations are the ubiquitious traders, hawkers banging the sides of insulated boxes containing frozen desserts. **********Shanghai is no longer virtually the only heavily industrialized city in China. But it still accounts for some 10 percent of the country's gross national product and, more important, has been among its most successful regions in moving into modern industry by attracting high-tech foreign investment. Heavy Western Investment **********Xerox makes desktop computers here; McDonnell Douglas assembles airplanes. Squibb pharmaceuticals exports medicine from Shanghai to the United States; Carrier produces air-conditioners here. **********The local hope is that some $20 billion in investments will have come in by the end of this century. But many here say a harsh crackdown on protests might discourage investors interested in Shanghai. In the worst case, a chain reaction of unrest could bring about the general strike that some workers say is possible. **********''We have three grievances,'' said a man standing on the edge of a demonstration today by students from the merchant seamen's academy, one of roughly 40 schools and institutes in Shanghai that have been organized for protests. ''One is rising prices. The second is corruption among Government officials. The third is the lack of democracy.'' **********But when pressed on whether the workers were ready to risk their livelihoods for the sake of political liberalization, the response was cautious. **********''The difference between us and the students is that we have family responsibilities,'' the textile worker said. ''Students don't have to worry about making a living.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/22/business/uncovered-short-sales-fall-1.3-on-the-big-board.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 7178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Fall 1.3% on the Big Board", "print_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Fall 1.3% on the Big Board", "body_text": " **********The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that short interest slipped 1.3 percent in the four-week period that ended Sept. 15. Short interest is the number of shares sold short by investors and not yet covered. **********The Big Board said that as of Sept. 15, 547.3 million shares were in a short position, down from 554.5 million on Aug. 15, the end of the last reporting period. The latest figure compared with a short interest of 447.2 million on Sept. 15, 1988, and was equivalent to five-tenths of a percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board.  Amex Short Sales at a Record **********The American Stock Exchange also reported its short interest yesterday. The Amex said short interest rose by 43,031 shares, to a record 51,887,160 in the month ended Sept. 15. The adjusted short interest for the month ended Aug. 15, 51,844,137, was also a record. **********A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since a short-seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought back at a lower price. **********Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors believe the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise would be bearish. **********Others, however, argue that a large ''overhang'' of shares sold short is really the bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish.  A New Twist to the Debate **********The debate has taken on a new tinge in recent years, as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. **********That change is primarily due to short selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers; convertible securities of a particular company, rights offerings; stock splits, or distributions and tenders. **********Short-interest figures may be even less meaningful, some market experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. **********Seasonal variations may also skew the short-interest figures. For example, analysts note additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-the-year tax strategies. **********The number of shares in which a short position is still held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers. **********The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period:                 Security Name   9/15/89   8/15/89               A.L.

**********President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea sought to assure Congress today that his nation would open its developing markets to foreign imports quickly and that anti-Americanism in his country was limited to a handful of radicals. **********In an address to a joint meeting in the House of Representatives, Mr. Roh also urged the United States not to cut the 43,000 American troops in South Korea. The idea of a cut has steadily gathered support in Congress, and the Pentagon has begun a reassessment of American troop strength in Asia. **********On economic matters, Mr. Roh asserted: ''Korea is moving vigorously toward a more open, liberalized and self-generating economy. It would be hard to find a country, developed or developing, which has moved so fast, so swiftly, in opening markets, liberalizing capital flows and reducing tariffs.'' **********Mr. Roh, the first South Korean President to address Congress since Syngman Rhee in 1954, said his Government felt the same political pressures as members of Congress feel from their constituents, and he appealed for patience in removing protectionist barriers to trade. He promised that in five years South Korean markets would be as open as those of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Envoy's Residence Broken Into **********The most recent demonstration of anti-Americanism erupted last week when several young Koreans broke into the residence of the American Ambassador, Donald Gregg, and threw fire bombs. Korean resentments have been building for years because of cultural conflicts arising from the presence of American troops and, more recently, from frictions over trade. **********Mr. Roh sought to dispel Congresssional criticism by saying: ''If you ask a Korean what America means to his country, his answer will be simple and clear. We are allies.'' **********''Regrettably, certain radicals have resorted to force and committed unlawful acts to pursue their aims under the guise of democratic reform,'' he said. ''Elements seeking to overthrow the basic principles of democracy through class struggle can be found among them. Here also are the tiny band of extremists who parade anti-American slogans, and perpetuate attacks on U.S. facilities.'' **********On American military forces in South Korea, Mr. Roh argued that lessening that presence could cause North Korea to miscalculate. But American political and military leaders have asserted that the United States, given budgetary pressures, could save money and still fill commitments to South Korea with a smaller military presence there."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/business/dow-off-a-3d-straight-day-but-up-for-week.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1989-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 484, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Off a 3d Straight Day but Up for Week", "print_headline": "Dow Off a 3d Straight Day but Up for Week", "body_text": " **********Stock prices ended mixed yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped for the third consecutive day. **********The Dow fell 2.50 points, to 2,331.25, but for the week it gained 8.39 points.

L. Doctorow, Larry McMurtry, Diana Trilling and Susan Sontag, many of whom attacked the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as an international outlaw whose calls for Mr. Rushdie's assassination represent a direct threat to the freedom of every writer. **********''We want to express our solidarity with Salman Rushdie, with his publisher, and with the independent booksellers who are continuing to sell his book,'' said Ms. Sontag, the president of PEN American Center and one of the organizers of the program. 'A Little Fortitude' **********''Most profoundly, we want to express a little civic fortitude in the face of this threat,'' she said. ''We want to show our refusal to be intimidated.'' **********Mr. Mailer declared, ''If he is ever killed for a folly, we must be killed for the same folly.'' **********Yesterday's activities in New York, echoed in rallies by writers' unions in Boston, Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, were held to mark the official publication date of Mr. Rushdie's novel ''The Satanic Verses'' by Viking Penguin. The rallies demonstrated a surge in indignation that, after several days of uncertainty and hesitation, has built up in response to the Iranian leader's calls for Mr. Rushdie and his publishers to be killed. **********Dozens of writers around the country called to support today's public meeting in New York, which was suggested by John R. MacArthur, the publisher of Harper's magazine, and jointly sponsored by American PEN, the Authors' Guild and Article 19, a recently created organization based in London that keeps track of censorship around the world. Those who took the rostrum were selected by one of the three organizations either to make statements or to read excerpts from Mr. Rushdie's novel, chosen by Gerald Marzorati, a Harper's senior editor. **********Earlier in the morning, about 300 members of the National Writers Union, an organization made up mostly of freelance writers, demonstrated in front of the Iranian Mission to the United Nations, on Third Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, where they heard Abbie Hoffman, the 1960's antiwar militant, say: **********''I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to take chances with a controversial book?'' **********The group tried unsuccessfully to deliver a letter to the Iranian Mission that declared in part: ''The attempt by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and others to force withdrawal of Rushdie's book is repugnant to Americans and, more important, in violation of our rights.'' **********The program was intended to show support for Mr. Rushdie, who is living in hiding under British police protection, and to represent at least a symbolic sharing of the threat he is enduring. It took place under tight security in a white-painted loft-like floor of a downtown Manhattan building that is the home to several art galleries. **********Outside, a crowd estimated by police as high as 3,000, umbrellas in hand, stood in a line that stretched up Broadway and around the block. Police officers, who used dogs to sweep the hall for bombs before the meeting began, had limited to 500 the total number of people who would be allowed inside. A Sense of the Moment **********Nonetheless, as each of the speakers pressed through the crowd to take the podium, there seemed to be a sense of portent - the feeling that the Iranian call for Mr. Rushdie and his publishers to be killed had awakened anew an awareness of principles often taken for granted. **********Robert K. Massie, a biographer and president of the Authors' Guild, drew enthusiastic applause when he proposed that all of his organization's 6,000 members ask their publishers to withdraw their books from the chains -Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble and B. Dalton - that stopped displaying or selling ''The Satanic Verses'' after the Iranian threats. **********Mr. Massie and the other speakers yesterday made their statements before the chain bookstores' announcement that they had decided to renew their displays and sales of Mr. Rushdie's novel. **********Many speakers were also harshly critical of President Bush, whose statement Tuesday on the Rushdie affair was deemed a weak and uncertain defense of American constitutional rights. 'Too Late and Too Little' **********Mr. Bush, asked during a news conference to comment on the Rushdie affair, said: ''However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior.'' **********''President Bush's statement was dramatically too late and shockingly too little,'' said one speaker yesterday, Robert A. Caro, whose books include a biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. Recalling Adminstration pledges that Iran would be held responsible for any actions taken against American interests, Mr. Caro continued: **********''Haven't there already been attacks on American interests? The freedom of expression has already been curtailed.'' The Khomeini death threat, he said, has had a ''chilling effect'' on writers who will have to overcome the prospective ''intimidation'' of those who oppose them. ''It strikes at the heart,'' he said, ''not only at the hearts of authors, but at the right of Americans to read what they want.'' **********''What is the Government hoping for?'' Mr. Caro asked. ''Compromise? On some issues there can be no compromise, and this is one of them.'' **********During his presentation, a voice from the crowd, seeming to criticize his lack of a suggestion for a specific course of action that the Government might take, rang out: ''What do you want us to do? Bomb Teheran?'' **********If there was a unifying theme to the PEN-Authors' Guild program, it was that the battle for free speech and expression is everybody's battle, that if one person is threatened, then everybody is threatened. **********''Rushdie the individual yields place to Rushdie the symbol of our freedom to write and to publish what we want,'' Diana Trilling said. Mrs. Trilling, apparently because of vision problems, stood by as her statement was read by a friend, Quentin Anderson. **********Leon Wieseltier, an editor at The New Republic, said: ''Europe, too, was once a theocratic society that burned books and people. We know all about the debt that democracy owes to heresy. **********''Who is this man of God who has no mercy in his heart?'' Mr. Wieseltier continued, referring to Ayatollah Khomeini. ''In defense of our mind, let us show no mercy. Let us be dogmatic about tolerance. It was blasphemy that made us free. Two cheers today for blasphemy.'' **********Another speaker, Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for The Nation, received the loudest response of the program when he applied the poet Shelley's line about the aging King George III, an ''old, mad, blind, despised and dying king,'' to the Ayatollah Khomeini. He also quoted Heine to the effect that ''Where books are burned, men will be burned.'' Then he said: **********''Until the threat of murder by contract is lifted, all authors should declare themselves as co-conspirators. It is time for all of us to don the yellow star and end the hateful isolation of our colleague.'' Fodder for U.S. Fundamentalists **********Mr. Mailer picked up this theme, declaring; ''In this week of turmoil, we can now envision a fearful time in the future when fundamentalist groups in America, stealing their page from this international episode, will know how to apply the same methods to American writers and bookstores. If they ever succeed, it will be due to the fact that we never found an honest resistance to the terrorization of Salman Rushdie.'' **********''I would suggest therefore,'' Mr. Mailer went on, ''that it is our duty to form ranks behind him, and our duty to state to the world that if he is ever assassinated, it will then become our obligation to stand in his place.'' **********Among the participants were some who reminded the audience that Ayatollah Khomeini does not represent all Muslims or all Islamic beliefs. **********Frances FitzGerald, the author of ''Fire in the Lake'' and other books, said, ''To see the Ayatollah as the representative of Islam is to see the Grand Inquisitor as the representative of Christianity.'' **********Edward W. Said, a professor of English at Columbia University and a member of the Palestine National Council, said ''The Satanic Verses'' was ''a deliberately transgressive work of nose-thumbing daring.'' He expressed dismay that the reaction to it by Ayatollah Khomeini had the effect, in non-Islamic eyes of reducing Islam to ''terrorism and fundamentalism.'' **********''We cannot accept,'' he said, ''that democratic freedoms need to be abrogated to protect Islam.'' **********At the same time, there were new denunciations of the Rushdie book, and of yesterday's readings and demonstrations, from an American Muslim group. M. T. Medhi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committee, said the authors taking part in the readings were ''insulting the sensitivities of eight million American Muslims and are playing into Ayatollah Khomeini's hands.'' **********''We should all cool it,'' he said, ''as a way out of the heated controversy.'' **********Earlier, the British actress Claire Bloom, before reciting a passage from ''The Satanic Verses,'' read a statement from the novelist Philip Roth, who was unable to attend yesterday's meeting. **********Mr. Roth declared his belief that he might on many questions disagree with Mr. Rushdie. **********''We would want to challenge each other's points of view,'' he said, ''but as to the right to challenge a point of view, we stand together.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/01/business/six-guilty-of-stock-conspiracy.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1989-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Six Guilty Of Stock Conspiracy", "print_headline": "Six Guilty Of Stock Conspiracy", "body_text": " **********The five principals of a defunct New Jersey investment partnership and a former trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. were found guilty yesterday by a Federal jury in Manhattan of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy to create illegal tax losses through fraudulent stock deals. **********The defendants in the case, which focused on trading by the partnership, Princeton/Newport Partners L.P., were the first to be charged with racketeering as part of the Government's investigation that began in 1986 into crime on Wall Street. Big Victory for Prosecutors **********The verdict in Federal District Court in Manhattan was an important victory for prosecutors. Defense lawyers contended that the Government had been overzealous in applying the Federal racketeering statute to violations of securities and tax laws. That statute has until recently been used primarily in organized-crime and drug-trafficking cases. **********The verdict has significant implications for the trial of Michael R. Milken, the former head of Drexel's high-yield bond unit. Mr. Milken is also charged with racketeering, and a number of the charges against him involve the same trades identified in the Princeton/Newport indictment. **********Defense lawyers said they would appeal. One, Paul R. Grand, called the verdict ''an outrage.'' He said the jury ''didn't even consider the evidence, or the lack of it.'' **********The Princeton/Newport officials who were convicted were James Sutton Regan, a managing partner; Charles M. Zarzecki, Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul Berkman, all general partners, and Steven Barry Smotrich, the controller, The former Drexel trader was Bruce Lee Newberg. Stock-Parking Scheme **********The Government charged the six men with engaging in a stock-parking scheme that allowed the investment firm, which was based in Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., to take illegal tax deductions. Prosecutors also contended that Princeton/ Newport helped Drexel to push down the price of a stock. **********Stock parking involves selling a security to another party with an agreement to repurchase it. The strategy is illegal if it is intended to conceal the true ownership of the security to evade reporting requirements or other Federal laws. **********The defense lawyers argued that the trades cited by the Government were part of a sophisticated hedging technique adopted by Princeton/ Newport to reduce the risk in its stock trading. They argued that even if the Government now believed the trades were illegal, the defendants had made them in the belief that they were legal. **********Each of the defendants was charged with two racketeering counts, each of which carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence. The jury will meet Tuesday to determine how much the defendants could be forced to forfeit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, known as RICO. **********Before the trial, which was heard before Judge Robert L. Carter, the defendants had posted more than $19 million to cover any potential forfeiture. **********Mr. Newberg, the former Drexel trader, was also named in the Milken indictment. Mr. Newberg's lawyers have argued that the charges in that case are based on the same actions in the Princeton/ Newport case, meaning that their client would be unconstitutionally tried twice for the same actions. They have said they would make a motion to have Mr. Newberg's name removed from the Milken indictment. **********The Princeton/Newport officials who were convicted were James Sutton Regan, a managing partner; Charles M. Zarzecki, Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul Berkman, all general partners, and Steven Barry Smotrich, the controller. **********Princeton/Newport, which was formed more than 20 years ago, invested the money of its limited partners in the securities markets, providing tax benefits to the limited partners. The partnership collapsed last December when many of the partners withdrew their investments, and defense lawyers argued that the failure was a direct result of the racketeering charges. **********Because of its use of the racketeering statute, the case has been widely viewed as the most significant to be tried since the Government began its investigation of crime on Wall Street after the fall of Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street stock speculator who agreed to settle insider trading charges with a $100 million payment in 1986. **********The case against the principals in the partnership were a factor in Drexel's decision in December to settle six charges of securities law violations with a $650 million payment. Drexel executives said evidence in the Princeton/Newport case led them to believe that their firm might lose a trial stemming from those trades. **********Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive of Drexel, told employees shortly after the settlement that the firm had no choice but to settle because of the possibility that racketeering charges would be brought against the firm. **********In its settlement, Drexel agreed to plead guilty to one criminal charge stemming from the Princeton/Newport case, involving an illegal conspiracy to drive down the price of the the C.O.M.B. Company's stock. Drexel also agreed to plead guilty to five other counts. **********Criminal racketeering charges are considered especially damaging because of the potential penalties allowed under the RICO law. Once convicted, defendants can be required to forfeit all of their interests in the enterprise used for criminal activities. That could amount to tens of millions of dollars in the Princeton/ Newport case. **********Benito Romano, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said he could not comment on the verdict until the jury finished its forfeiture deliberations. **********Since the charges against the six men were filed, the case has been almost secondary to its implications. Defense lawyers in a number of securities fraud cases, including attorneys for Mr. Milken, frequently attended each session, hoping to glean a sense of the evidence that might be used in future Wall Street trials. Raid in December 1987 **********The case against the Princeton/ Newport defendants began to unfold in December 1987, when about 50 Federal marshals raided the New Jersey offices of the investment partnership. The Government had received a tip from William Hale, a former employee who worked at the partnership's trading desk. Mr. Hale had been dismissed from the partnership before he agreed to testify for the Government. **********In their search, the Government seized more than 60 boxes of documents. They also took hundreds of hours of tape recordings of telephone conversations from the partnership's trading room. The recordings, which were used extensively in the prosecution, were kept by the partnership in the normal course of business to insure the accuracy of trades. **********As the negotiations before the indictment wound down, defense lawyers said last year, it became clear that the targets of the Government's inquiry were not the six men. Rather, these lawyers said the Government told them their clients were needed to testify in other cases, including that against Mr. Milken."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/world/clamor-in-the-east-berlin-border-guards-stunned-by-the-news.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Berlin Border Guards Stunned by the News", "print_headline": "CLAMOR IN THE EAST; Berlin Border Guards Stunned by the News", "body_text": " **********The East German border police at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point in the Berlin wall were stunned today to learn that citizens could now travel through to the West freely. **********''People are going to read this and say, 'There must be some mistake,' '' said a young guard, shaken out of his normally severe bearing and talking animatedly. **********''It's not good,'' another said an hour after the decision was announced.

The Flow Abates a Bit **********Since then, the number coming permanently to West Germany has diminished to a steady flow of 2,000 to 3,000 on weekdays, and 1,000 to 2,000 on weekends, according to officials of the West German Interior Ministry in Bonn. Six hundred more come to West Berlin each day. **********The East German authorities lifted the border restrictions to slow the flow of young people fleeing the country. Many fled because they were barred from travel to the West. **********The East Germans say they have now issued passports to all 1.3 million East Berliners. Between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27, East Germans made 16.6 million visits to West Berlin and West Germany, according to figures released by Gunter Arndt, the deputy chief East German customs officer. Many of those were repeat visits. Before the mass departures began earlier this fall, the East German population was estimated at 16.7 million. A Difference on Weekends **********Curiously, on weekends, when the number of East German visitors to the West rises dramatically, the number of those who decide not to return home declines, said the Interior Ministry in Bonn, which said many weekend visitors were family members having reunions. **********On a typical weekday - between 4 A.M. last Thursday and 4 A.M. Friday, for example - more than 400,000 East Germans visited West Germany, and 2,485 stayed, registering as permanent residents. The previous day there were 364,812 visitors and 2,576 people who resettled.

Friday to 4 A.M. this morning, there were 599,400 visitors and only 1,490 people who resettled, the Interior Ministry said. #10 Million East German Visits So far this year, West Germany has received 10 million East German visits, and 290,731 East Germans stayed permanently. Since Nov. 1 alone, 123,527 East Germans have been accepted to resettle, according to official figures that do not include West Berlin. **********The enclave city, which has absorbed 42,332 East Germans and 11,125 ethnic German refugees from other Communist countries this year, declared itself unable to take any more at the end of last month.

Mr. Menem, soon to complete six months in office, has already had three economy ministers and three central bank presidents. New Unrest in Military **********Military problems that Mr. Menem thought he had resolved early in October with a series of pardons for officers accused of political murder and torture and others accused of rebellion surfaced again after he forced two leaders of army dissidents into retirement. **********One of them, Col. Mohamed Seineldin, seemed to challenge authority by openly leading a hundred or so of his followers in workouts in a public park last month. Later, the newspaper Pagina 12 published photographs of what it said was a training camp for the dissidents' Dignity Battalion outside Buenos Aires. **********The military rebels also took part in an anniversary mass for the barracks uprising they staged a year ago, one of three during the Government of former President Raul Alfonsin. The uprisings were intended to express discontent with military pay and equipment and with court efforts to try hundreds of officers and retired officers for the brutal methods used against suspected leftist subversives in the 1970's. **********An unexplained bomb exploded in front of the army headquarters on Thursday and another blew up a car in a military housing project in the city of La Plata on Friday. Colonel Seineldin, through a spokesman, attributed the first bomb to ''people out of control'' and discontent over military pay and the ''lack of attention paid to noncommissioned officers.'' Economy in Trouble **********The Argentine economy, long troubled by high inflation, immense public deficits, inefficiency, speculation and capital flight, has seemed on the verge of coming completely unhinged since last February, leading many Argentines to comment that their country might become the first to achieve more or less peaceful anarchy. **********In the months just before and after the presidential elections in May, economic woes combined with political uncertainty over the policies of the future President to set off an inflation spiral that culminated at a rate of 200 percent for the month of July. That was the month Mr. Menem took office, assuming power five months ahead of schedule because Mr. Alfonsin could no longer manage the economy. **********Mr. Menem's campaign image had been that of a populist who many thought would follow the lavish state spending style of the late Juan D. Peron, the founder of Mr. Menem's party, the Justicialist, or Peronist, movement. But soon after his election he declared his intention to restructure the economy along free-market lines, reduce the size of the state and force Argentine manufacturers, long protected by high tariffs, to become competitive. **********In a daring game plan, he set out to align the owners and managers of Argentina's biggest businesses with free-market-oriented technocrats and his own party followers. **********Particularly important was the link he forged with Jorge Born, one of the owners of Bunge and Born, a holding company that produces food and consumer products for the internal market and exports grain. Mr. Born became Mr. Menem's confidant and provided a number of executives of his company for key Government posts. Alliance Breaks Apart **********But the alliance gradually broke apart in the last two months in disputes over whether to free the exchange rate and lower tariffs and how to collect taxes.

The General Labor Confederation, the backbone of Peronism, split into two groups, partly as a result of differences over Government plans to privatize state companies and reduce work forces. **********This month Nestor Rapanelli, a former Bunge and Born chief executive officer, resigned as Economy Minister, taking all of the Bunge and Born appointees with him.

The issue has caused severe strains in relations between Washington and Bonn. **********Present and former Administration officials say American concern about the Libyan plant arose against a record of persistent German indifference to dubious technology exports. Waiting for Bonn Enforcement **********In the last two years, Washington has lodged more than 15 diplomatic protests over sales by West German companies to the Eastern bloc or the third world. For all their hopes, those officials say it remains to be seen whether Bonn has the will to follow through on its proposed new restrictions and properly enforce them. **********Government officials say a highly classified evaluation being drafted by intelligence analysts concludes that West German companies are playing a leading role in exports of chemical weapons technology to the Eastern bloc and the spread of chemical weapons in the third world. Such documents are circulated among high-level officials but not released to the public. **********Administration officials say intelligence reports in recent years have shown that West German companies sold chemical weapons technology to Iran, Iraq and Syria, high-technology machine tools used for military purposes to members of the Warsaw Pact, heavy water for nuclear-bomb manufacture to India and Pakistan, and missile technology to Libya, Egypt and other third world nations. **********''From the point of view of leakage of technology, they are the biggest problem,'' said Stephen D. Bryen, formerly the Pentagon official responsible for stopping exports of such material. ''The majority of the techno-bandits come from Germany.'' Protest to Bonn 6 Years Ago **********Kenneth L. Adelman, a former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said he protested to the West Germans about their companies' export of poison-gas technology to Iraq and elsewhere more than six years ago. **********''The Germans have been a big problem,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''I personally talked to them five or six years ago about exporting chemnicals to the bad guys. They never really took it seriously. On chemicals, they've been the most egregious offenders.'' **********American diplomats have complained to West Germany and other nations for several months about companies involved in the Libyan plant. **********After The New York Times, on Jan. 1, reported American assertions that Imhausen-Chemie played a central role in the Libyan plant, Mr. Kohl and other Bonn political leaders complained bitterly that West Germany was being victimized by an American press campaign. **********By today, a senior Administration official said, Bonn's attitude had changed. ''They are doing the right things now,'' he said. ''They are a lot more sober and if not apologizing, they're at least recognizing there is a problem.'' **********At the same time, the police in West Germany and Belgium began seizing documents that outlined an extensive covert supply network that the Libyans relied on to provide materials for the plant. ''They're out of business,'' an Administration official said. But he was quick to note that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, was now likely to redouble his efforts to obtain new technical advisers, computer software and other equipment. 'We've Bought Some Time' **********Several officials said they believed that Colonel Qaddafi would eventually get what was needed to make large quantities of poison gas at the plant. They predicted that the problem of how to react to Libya's chemical capability would reappear as an issue for the Bush Adminstration. **********''What we've done is slow him down,'' an Administration official said. ''We've bought some time. But if you've got enough money, eventually someone, somewhere, will sell you what you need.'' **********The continuing disagreement between Bonn and Washington over trade reflects differing philosophies of international commerce. While American rules require companies to apply for licenses on much of their dealings overseas, Bonn has fostered overseas trade and provided that items not explicitly prohibited can be exported. **********Unlike the Reagan Administration, which set up new Government groups to control trade in advanced material or technology, Bonn has lagged. An Administration official said the Bonn Government employs only five people to review more than 100,000 applications a year for export of West German chemical or nuclear technology. New Incidents Disclosed **********In describing the Reagan Administration's continuing problems with West German companies, former senior Administration officials described several previously undisclosed incidents and gave new account of the secret diplomacy that surrounded some of the better-known cases of recent years. **********Former Administration officials said one complaint made by the United States involved the sale by a West German company in the early 1980's of deep-tunneling equipment that could be used to dig bomb shelters for senior Soviet officials. **********Former officials said that issue was repeatedly raised by Caspar W. Weinberger, then the Secretary of Defense, in meetings with his German counterparts, who responded that the equipment was being used for civilian projects such as subway construction. **********Other officials noted the difference in reaction to the so-called Toshiba case, in which Japanese and Norwegian companies were implicated in the sale of machine tools to the Soviet Union used to make sophisticated propellers for a new generation of quieter Soviet submarines. A Norwegian police report on the incident identified West German and French companies that had also violated export rules in the shipment of tools to the Soviet Union. French Made Arrests **********Administration officials said both Paris and Bonn had been asked by the United States to investigate. The French inquiry led to arrests, but the West Germans responded that the Norwegian police were incorrect, and that only machine tools allowed for export by European and American rules had been sent to the Soviet Union. American intelligence has independently confirmed the accuracy of the Norwegian police report on this issue, Administration officials said. **********Several present and former Administration officials said the West German Government's public statements this week on the role played by Imhausen-Chemie were typical of Bonn's private responses to the diplomatic entreaties from Washington. That pattern, the officials said, has involved denials followed by demands for intelligence information that the United States has traditionally refused to provide to West Germany. The process has in most cases ended in impasse. **********In 1984, American intelligence concluded that Karl Kolb, a West German company, had supplied the plant and chemicals used by Iraq to make chemical weapons for use in its war with Iran. The company has acknowledged having done work in Iraq, but it denies any role in chemical weapons manufacture. **********''We had them dead to rights,'' said an American official who was part of the delegation that met with the Germans. ''We had three things: the engineering configuration of the plant, which our experts said was unmistakenably chemical weapons. We had the deployment of anti-aircraft guns, and we had other sources that we couldn't share which were even more direct. We knew 100 percent it was a chemical weapons plant.'' **********The Bonn Government has been trying to investigate Karl Kolb for nearly five years, but the company successfully challenged in court the validity of the 1984 export restrictions drawn up by Bonn to prevent the export of chemical-weapons technology and equipment. The West German Government announced this week that it was renewing its efforts to investigate the Iraqi case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/world/east-bloc-optimistic-on-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1989-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "East Bloc Optimistic On Arms", "print_headline": "East Bloc Optimistic On Arms", "body_text": " **********President Mikhail S.

Shoen, and six of his children, are suing the management of Amerco Inc., U-Haul's privately held parent, which is led by Joseph Shoen. Joseph Shoen is the third of Leonard Shoen's 12 children by three mothers. **********Meanwhile, Leonard Shoen says a bidder that he will not identify has offered $1 billion for 87.5 percent of Amerco's stock. Joseph Shoen says he doubts such an offer has been made. **********But amid the bickering, U-Haul's business appears to be improving. Last year profits rose sixfold, to $13.2 million, and company executives say earnings in the 1989 fiscal year should reach $39 million. **********U-Haul has borrowed to modernize its fleet of trucks, and rentals are up 20 percent over last year, the company reports. **********Leonard Shoen, 71 years old and widely known as L. S., founded the company in 1945. He said last week that the unidentified investor was offering $10,000 a share for 87.5 percent of Amerco's stock, a person involved in the discussions said. **********Joseph Shoen said none of the company's officers or independent directors had been contacted about a proposal. ''I don't have any facts on which to come to the belief that someone is trying to buy the company,'' he said in a telephone interview last week. **********Joseph Shoen said his father said he had ''spoken with someone who represents someone who is interested in making an offer,'' but his father would not identify the would-be bidder. **********''It's an absurd situation,'' Mr. Shoen said. ''If they were serious, they'd send in a small army of law=yers and accountants.'' **********Six Shoen children and their father, who was pushed into retirement by two of his sons in 1986, retained Bear, Stearns & Company as an adviser last summer, hoping to find a way to make their U-Haul investment more liquid. **********''The best solution of shareholders who have serious disagreements is to go their separate ways,'' said Michael E. Tennenbaum, vice chairman of investment banking for Bear, Stearns in Los Angeles. ''We're trying to facilitate that.'' The Odds for a Takeover **********While the do-it-yourself truck rental business is expected to continue to grow, U-Haul's past performance and considerable debt make it a long-odds takeover candidate despite its improvement, said George G. Morris, an analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben in Cleveland. **********''It has quite a name,'' he said. ''But it would be a big challenge. Profits have been scarce and management has been lousy.'' **********''It's a real can of worms,'' said John Kalmbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. **********The 1973 energy crisis led to the closing of many full-service gas stations that were U-Haul dealers, forcing the company to open stand-alone outlets. It also diversified its rental inventory with items like jet skis and paint sprayers, both costly investments that have never paid off. A Challenge From Ryder **********U-Haul's business also suffered from an aggressive rival, Ryder System Inc. of Miami, which entered the business in 1970. Each company has about 45 percent of the $1 billion-a-year one-way truck rental business, although Ryder has a fleet of 30,000 vehicles while U-Haul has 66,000. **********In the year ended March 31, 1987, U-Haul's profits plunged to $2 million from a 1984 peak of $42 million. **********But even before the poor financial results emerged, two sons, Joseph, who is 39, and Samuel, who is 43, had forced their father into retirement. Joseph became chairman of Amerco, based in Las Vegas, Nev., and Samuel became president of U-Haul, based in Phoenix. **********But disagreements between the brothers led Samuel to quit in May 1987. Last summer the alliance of ''outsiders,'' as Samuel calls his group, sued the company's management to block the issuance of 8 percent of U-Haul's stock to ''key employees.'' **********The suit accuses management of illegally issuing the stock to protect itself and to dilute the holdings of other shareholders. Three of Leonard Shoen's children, including Joseph, still sit on the Amerco board, along with independent directors. **********With the new shares, the outsiders' holdings declined to 47 percent, from 51 percent. ''We intend to go to full trial,'' said Samuel Shoen, who owns 11 percent. **********In November, Amerco went to court in Arizona seeking $750 million in damages from Samuel Shoen and his wife, Eva, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The suit contends that Samuel Shoen intentionally damaged the company's credit, causing U-Haul to lose employees and business opportunities. **********''It's a war of attrition to use the company's treasury to spend us into bankruptcy,'' Samuel Shoen said. **********The lawsuits ''have as much to do with personalities and social relationships as with business,'' Joseph Shoen said. **********While Amerco is privately held, the company files some public documents.

Baker 3d's blueprint for a new European order won generally favorable reviews today from European statesmen and commentators, but privately many officials predicted that Washington will have a difficult time putting its vision into practice. **********In a speech in Berlin on Tuesday, Mr. Baker outlined the Bush Administration's view of what he called ''a new architecture for a new era'' in Europe. The thrust of his speech was to provide a series of ideas on how institutions like NATO, the European Community and the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe can be transformed in ways that will both enable them to adapt to the changing European landscape and help insure that this landscape changes in ways that won't wreak havoc. **********A spokesman for Jacques Delors, the president of the community, said Mr. Baker's speech was ''right in line'' with Mr. Delors's thinking. A few miles away at NATO headquarters, Secretary General Manfred Worner said he was ''fully in line with Secretary Baker's political proposals,'' particularly a suggestion that NATO establish a new arms control verification staff. **********But behind the praise, many questions are being raised as to how the United States will go about carrying out some of Mr. Baker's proposals -not because those proposals are being seen as particular naive or wrongheaded but because they require such radical changes in long-established European institutions. Repeat of Bush's Plan **********For example, Mr. Baker in his speech repeated President Bush's four-point plan for German unification. That plan endorses German unity on the condition that it come about as a result of free voting in West and East Germany, that West Germany remain a member of the European Community and NATO, that unification is not accompanied by any enlargement of Germany's postwar borders and on the condition that it take place ''step by step.'' **********The problem, as Mr. Baker discovered in his talks in Potsdam on Tuesday with East Germany's Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, is that many East Germans are not in a step-by-step mood. As Mr. Modrow explained to Mr. Baker, the push for unification from East Germans is being driven not so much as nationalist impulses but by consumer impulses, not by visions of a grand Germany but visions of videocassette recorders. **********''It is the East German consumer who is going to decide the fate of Central Europe,'' remarked a NATO diplomat. ''Baker outlined a very sensible framework for unification, but I don't know if it is ever going to implemented. East German workers don't want 'socialism with a human face.' They want capitalism. If people continue to leave at the rate they are, the infrastructure of the East German Government and medical system is going to collapse. It is not something you can stop with Government statements.'' New Missions for Alliance **********As for NATO, Mr. Baker argued that because the Soviet threat is diminishing it must find new tasks to maintain its cohesion and relevance, it was time to begin discussing new missions for the Western alliance. NATO, he argued, has to be seen not as a transitory institution aimed at confronting a military threat, but as a good in itself, as a structure that binds Western Europe and the United States and gives a sense of shared destiny. **********But that is easier said than done. Mr. Baker offered three proposals: That NATO establish an arms control verification staff that could help members monitor what are expected to be a wide range of conventional arms control agreement between East and West in the coming years, that NATO involve itself more in trying to solve regional conflicts and that NATO consider taking on some more political and economic responsibilities, like promoting free trade or free elections or environmental protection in Europe. **********But for NATO to confront such issues its members would have to agree not only what they are against - a Soviet invasion - but what they are for. One NATO official said: ''We have lived off the Soviet threat for a long time. The question is, Is there life after threat?'' While NATO already has economic, environmental and scientific research wings that could easily assume some broader functions, the idea that NATO could get involved in tackling such thorny regional issues as the Middle East, southern Africa or Central America is viewed as unrealistic, given the conflicting priorities of the various members. Ties With European Community **********Maybe the most radical idea Mr. Baker offered was that the United States consider signing a treaty to significantly strengthen the ''institutional and consultative links'' between Washington and the European Community. Mr. Baker had several motivations for making this proposal. With the 12 members of the community due to merge into a single 320-million-person market in 1992, it is going to be a major economic and politial force in the core of any new Europe. The community will be responsible for anchoring a unified Germany in the West and attracting Eastern Europe toward free markets. Given that enlarged role, the Bush Administration wants to make sure that it has some formalized mechanism for influencing decisions before they are made. **********At the same time, Mr. Baker is apparently trying to exploit the European desire to see America continue to play a role on the Continent to get a toehold into the European Community. As the community becomes a huge single market, the United States has to make sure that its trade interests are being protected, and its interest in areas like product standards in the European market. **********Pulling off such an institutionalized arrangement, said one senior community official, would be ''very, very complicated.'' The community is getting involved in regulating everything from pesticides to telephones and if the United States sought private consultations every time a tariff was being raised ''we would need 5,000 people here,'' said one American official. More important, there would likely be political resistance, led by France, for anything that suggests Washington is becoming a de facto 13th member of the European Community. The French have tended to view the community as their vehicle for exercising influence throughout Europe and NATO as America's vehicle. American diplomats believe Paris still harbors the hope that one day ''NATO will wither away'' and the community will become the dominant political and economic force in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/14/business/japan-s-new-farm-belt.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1989-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1935, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan's New Farm Belt", "print_headline": "Japan's New Farm Belt", "body_text": " **********In California's agricultural belt, a meat-packing plant that had been closed for years reopened recently with new financial backing - Japanese.

Production costs here are far lower than in Japan, the land of the $25 melon and the $20-a-pound sirloin. To compete against cheap imports, Japanese companies are establishing their own sources of inexpensive food in the United States. **********''It's very economical to produce here and export to Japan,'' said Taizo Sano, a representative here of the Kagome Company, Japan's largest ketchup producer, which is building a ketchup and fruit drink factory in Los Banos, Calif. **********The Japanese investment is generally welcomed, for it is helping revitalize depressed American farm areas and is providing a new market for American agricultural products. In fact, California officials recently completed a trip to Japan specifically to court food companies. **********But the trend is also stirring some uneasiness. After similar waves of investment in factories, banks and real estate, even the American cowboy now seems to be falling under Japanese sway. And some feel frustrated that after the United States finally pried open Japan's food market to American food exports, it is the Japanese companies that are positioning themselves to benefit, possibly blocking American competitors. **********Some cattlemen, although not many, have raised concern, said Thomas M. Cook, director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemen's Association in Washington, which at its last convention resolved to monitor the situation. ''They want to sell them the beef, not the operations,'' he said. **********But Japanese companies argue that they need food production facilities to tailor the products to Japanese tastes. For example, Japanese consumers prefer a fatty, highly marbled beef, they say. **********''Our American consumer now is geared to the lean type of beef. They can't really go out on the open market and buy the cattle they want,'' said Gene Davis, president of Mount Shasta Beef, in Cottonwood, Calif., which is partly Japanese owned. **********To be sure, Japanese investment is still in its infancy, and might prove to be as inconsequential as the feared Arab invasion in the 1970's, which led Congress to require disclosure of foreign purchases of farm land. **********Altogether, foreigners own only 12.5 million acres, or just under 1 percent of the 1.3 billion acres of privately owned American farmland and timberland, according to the Department of Agriculture, and Japanese own only 218,000 acres, less than 2 percent of that held by foreigners. **********Still, after holding steady for many years, the amount of Japanese-owned farmland jumped more than 40 percent in 1988. Japanese made 42 purchases totaling 65,000 acres in 1988, a steep rise from the 15 acquisitions totaling less than 5,000 acres in 1987. **********The major purchases in 1988 included the $3.5 million purchase of a 31,000-acre ranch in Colorado by Otaka International and a $54 million stake in the huge 25,000-acre Fellsmere citrus grove in Florida by the Sumitomo Corporation. The Zenchiku Company, a major meat wholesaler, bought Montana's 28,000-acre Selkirk Ranch, but too late to be included in the Agriculture Department's 1988 tally. **********Tetsusaburo Hayashi, director of agriculture for the Japan External Trade Organization, a trade promotion agency affiliated with the Japanese Government, said that at least 40 Japanese food companies had some factory or other facilities in the United States, with about half of those in California. But he expects the number to grow rapidly. **********''Every restaurant chain and supermarket is forced to think about the possibility in order to compete with other companies or with imported food,'' said Mr. Hayashi, who is based in Los Angeles. ''It's still low key, but below the water many companies are doing research or feasibility studies.'' **********Under a trade agreement reached last June, Japan's import quotas on beef and oranges will be raised each year until they disappear in April 1991. Orange juice quotas will end in April 1992. Quotas on other products, including tomato sauce, apple juice and ice cream will end at various times during the next three years under a separate agreement signed about a month later. **********Even with the quotas, Japan has become the largest export market for American farm products, surpassing all the Western European nations combined. But with the quotas being lifted, some analysts say the market for American products, particularly beef and fruit juices, could easily double or triple. **********Japanese companies are attracted to the United States in part by the comparatively low prices - raw food products like tomatoes are one-fifth their cost in Japan, where land is limited. But other factors are also important, including the weakness of the dollar against the yen and the lower cost of American packaging materials, like aluminum cans. Those factors make it economical for companies like Kagome to produce and package ketchup and fruit drinks in California, rather than Japan. **********So far, much of the action appears to be in beef. Japanese beef consumption is only one-fifth the American level per capita at present, so Japan could become a big market for American beef producers, who are facing a decline in domestic consumption. **********Earlier this month, a Japanese company named Stamina Foods and the Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading company, announced that they would build a beef-processing plant in Fremont, Neb., to produce special cuts of meat for export to Japan. Japanese companies have also bought the Washington Beef Company, a processor in Yakima, Wash., and half of Colonial Beef in Philadelphia. **********In California, Masaaki Tanabe, an exporter, has put together a network of joint ventures with Americans, including a ranch to breed cattle, feeding lots to fatten them and packing houses to slaughter and butcher them into Japanese-style cuts. Mount Shasta Beef, as well as Southfield Beef Packing Inc., which took over the deserted meat-packing plant in Fresno, are two of these ventures. Americans run them and are part owners. **********The meat from this vertically integrated network will then be exported by Mr. Tanabe's South Pasadena company, Mercury Overseas, which is partly owned by the Hannan Corporation, a major meat wholesaler in Osaka. **********Other food areas are also seeing Japanese investments. At least five California wineries have been bought in the last few years by Japanese brewers and pharmaceutical companies, eager to learn about wine in general and to supply the growing Japanese market, where California wine is starting to make inroads. **********Several American bottling companies are already bottling fruit and soft drinks for Japanese companies. **********Even rice, the product Japan has given the most protection, is seeing some action. While rice cannot be imported easily, some products made from rice can. A Japanese-owned company called American Sunny Foods, based in Stockton, Calif., began exporting rice flour to Japan last year, mixing it with sugar to skirt the import barriers. The sugar is removed and sold in Japan, and the flour is used to make rice pastries known as mochi, a spokesman said. **********The American production of sake, a rice wine, goes mainly to supply Japanese restaurants in this country, but California officials expect exports to begin eventually. The Napa sake factory, which will be the fourth in California, is being built by Kohnan Inc., which is owned by Satsuma Shuzo, a Japanese brewing company. Kohnan also bought a Napa winery, which it has renamed the Silverado Hills Cellars, according to Kojiro (Mike) Iwasaki, its president. **********One long-term threat to American food and agriculture companies is that the Japanese will use their United States facilities not only for exports but also to penetrate the American market. Indeed, the Fresno cotton mill - being built by a Japanese textile producer, Nisshinbo Industries, along with Kanematsu-Gosho Ltd., a trading company - is aimed at selling to the American market where there are barriers to imported textiles. **********Mr. Sano of Kagome said the company was also thinking eventually of expanding its California facility to move into the United States ketchup market, first by producing for American companies. The factory in Los Banos will only use one-quarter of the land the company bought. ''We have room to grow,'' he said.  THE TRADE PACT: NO VICTORY? **********When the farm trade agreements between the United States and Japan were signed last summer, American trade officials predicted that sales of American beef and oranges to Japan would double within a few years. Judging from their investments in American ranches and citrus groves, Japanese companies agree. **********But Colin Carter, an associate professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis, argues that the results of the trade agreements might well prove disappointing for the United States. **********In a paper he will present at a conference in South Korea this week, Dr. Carter argues that Japan has been favoring the United States under the existing quota system because of America's political importance. Once the quotas disappear, as the trade agreements provide, total imports by Japan will increase but the American share of those imports is likely to decline and there might even be an absolute decrease in American exports, he said. **********Dr. Carter noted that the American share of beef imported by Japan rose to 35 percent in 1986 from 2 percent in 1970, while Australia's share declined to 59 percent from 87 percent. Japan excludes Canadian beef. **********Both Australia and Canada are net exporters of beef to the United States, suggesting they have a competitive advantage, Dr. Carter said. Hence they should be able to outsell Americans in the Japanese market once Tokyo stops controlling the sources of its imports, he said. Moreover, he noted, the United States imports more beef than it exports, so that any price increase resulting from Japan's market opening would have a net detrimental effect on the United States trade balance, he said. **********Others disagree. ''I've heard that argument and I'm skeptical,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former chief American trade negotiator with Japan. **********Tommy Beall, director of market research at Cattle-Fax, a Denver market analysis concern, said American exports to Japan are high-quality, grain-fed beef that do not directly compete with lower-quality Australian beef, which is also the kind the United States imports. **********But Dr. Carter is not alone in pointing out that the results of the trade agreement might not result in a straightforward increase in American exports. For instance, if American beef displaces Japanese beef, then the Japanese might buy less American grain for use as cattle feed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/world/plo-and-israel-to-get-bush-ideas-on-mideast-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1989-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1490, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.L.O.

AND ISRAEL TO GET BUSH IDEAS ON MIDEAST PEACE", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration plans to ask Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to take steps to ease tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to lay the foundation for peace talks, a senior Administration official said. **********The official said the Administration's suggestions for Israel will be presented on Monday when Israel's Foreign Minister, Moshe Arens, meets with President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Similar proposals will be conveyed soon after to the P.L.O. through the American Ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau, Jr., the senior official said.  Several Suggestions **********Among the suggestions the Administration is expected to put to Israel are these: *********** Releasing some of the Palestinians arrested during the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. *********** Ending or limiting administrative detentions of Palestinians. *********** Reopening schools in the occupied territories. **********The suggestions for the P.L.O. are expected to include these: *********** A halt to violent demonstrations in the territories. *********** Blocking anti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon. *********** Stopping distribution of inflammatory leaflets in the occupied lands.  A Gradual Approach **********While the senior official did not say so explicitly, it appears that the Bush Administration intends to use its good offices with Israel, and its dialogue with the P.L.O., to try gradually to nurture some type of peace negotiations between the Israelis and the P.L.O. and the West Bank and Gaza Palestinians. **********The first stage of this process will be to ask both parties to adopt measures that would prove to the other that it is willing and able to bring about a more peaceful relationship on the ground. **********The senior official made it clear that the Administration's approach does not involve a detailed, full-fledged peace plan, as many past administrations have tried. In fact, it is just the opposite. It is based on the conviction, said one senior State Department official, that ''peace in the Middle East cannot be made in America.'' **********''In the last analysis, the parties out there have to make the tough decisions and all we can do is help them lay the foundations and build the proper frame as they go along,'' he said. **********Once that is done, he said, any number of diplomatic moves - an international conference or some other negotiating format - can be considered. **********''We should take our time, till the ground carefully and only move when we think there is a reasonable chance of success,'' said the senior Administration official. **********What the Administration will tell Mr. Arens, the senior official explained, is that ''tilling the ground, in our view, means improving the climate and that means you need to be thinking in terms of what you can do to better the situation on the ground.'' **********''We want to convey the same message to the P.L.O. through our dialogue in Tunis - what they can do to improve the situation on the ground - so that hopefully the whole atmosphere and climate will improve to the point that we can then begin to talk about how do we get the parties together,'' he said. **********Mr. Arens was in New York today on his way to Washington. Arabs' Release to Be Sought **********State Department and Israeli officials said Israel will be asked to consider releasing some of the thousands of Palestinians arrested by the Israeli Army for taking part in demonstrations in their 15-month-old uprising, or intifada, as it is known in Arabic, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Israel will be asked to consider desisting from or sharply curtailing the use of administrative detentions. Under this practice, the Israeli military authorities can arrest and hold without charges anyone suspected by security forces of being involved in activities deemed harmful to the state. **********Israel has used administrative detentions to round up several thousand Palestinians suspected of inciting the uprising. In this same vein, Israel will also be asked to consider halting the use of deportations as a means of punishing leaders of the rebellion. **********The Administration will also suggest that the Israeli consider reopening schools in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that have been closed by the Israeli military authorities because the students used them as gathering points to organize demonstrations. Easing Economic Restrictions **********Israel will be asked to consider easing some of the economic restrictions imposed on those Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who have not paid their taxes since the beginning of the uprising, in December 1987, if not earlier. Through a central computer in Israel's Defense Ministry, the Israeli authorities are able to see that Palestinians who have not paid their taxes are barred from obtaining identity cards, driver's licenses, travel permits and trade documents. **********Israel will be asked to consider lifting some restrictions on Palestinian economic development in the occupied territories. Because the Israeli military government in the occupied territories controls who can dig wells, who can grow what crops, who can set up factories for certain industrial products, who can export, and who can import, it has been able to stunt the development of a Palestinian economic infrastructure that might compete with the Israeli economy. Challenges to the P.L.O.  As for the P.L.O., the Administration plans to challenge it to make some equally substantive concessions to Israel. The next step in the United States-P.L.O. dialogue, the senior official said, ''is the same that I said we would be discussing with Arens - that is how the P.L.O. can convince the Palestinians in the occupied territories to take steps to improve the climate.'' **********The official said: ''What are those steps? I don't want to get into that in too much detail, but suppose that the Israelis were willing to stop the sweeps, or to change the way they are approaching the intifada, maybe the intifada itself could change. That is the general way we approach it.'' Considerations for Arafat **********According to American officials, the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, will be asked to consider, among other things, ordering a halt to stone-throwing demonstrations and strikes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to block all raids against Israeli troops in south Lebanon and to cease distributing leaflets in the occupied territories that might be considered inflammatory. **********The idea behind these suggestions is to test Mr. Arafat's ability and willingess to deliver a new atmosphere on the ground among his own people. **********State Department officials say that only through this route might Mr. Arafat create a situation in which Israel, down the road, would be prepared to engage in direct talks with the P.L.O., West Bankers and Gazans. **********The Bush Administration's approach is problematic for Mr. Arafat on two levels. First, it will require him, in effect, to call off the intifada temporarily in return for improvements on the ground for West Bankers and Gazans. But there would be little tangible gain for the P.L.O. as a political organization. **********The P.L.O. will apparently be told that down the road, if this first stage succeeds and a level of mutual confidence can be created, it will be brought more directly into the negotiating process. In the meantime, the P.L.O. may have to content itself with the fact that for the first time it could be a formal but indirect interlocutor with Israel in United States Middle East diplomacy. **********The Bush Administration may also discuss with both the P.L.O. and the Israelis some general ideas it has about what the ''final status'' in the occupied territories should be, so that neither side will be under the misapprehension that these gradual opening steps are all that Washington envisions. 'The Right Circumstances' **********''While we think under the right circumstances an international conference, properly structured, would be acceptable, we do not believe that now is the time to move,'' said the senior Administration official. ''Why? Because we think that much needs to be done on the ground to improve the atmosphere that would give us a better opportunity to get the parties together.'' **********The Administration is expecting Mr. Arens to convey all these ideas to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the hope that when Mr. Shamir comes to Washington in the first week in April for a meeting with President Bush he will bring with him some serious proposals along these lines. **********Israel's supporters in Congress have been telling Israeli diplomats in Washington that they too expect Mr. Shamir to put forward some substantive and realistic ideas that would advance the peace process and truly challenge the Palestinians to do the same."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/16/world/soviets-apparently-resume-arms-airlift-to-kabul.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1989-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Apparently Resume Arms Airlift to Kabul", "print_headline": "Soviets Apparently Resume Arms Airlift to Kabul", "body_text": " **********A month after Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, the Kremlin appears to have resumed an intensive airlift of military supplies to the Kabul Goverment. **********The Soviet move is an effort to help the Government stave off a potentially decisive defeat by guerrillas laying siege to the city of Jalalabad. **********Although no formal announcement as been made, evidence of a major Soviet effort to bolster Kabul's forces has been growing for several days. **********One indication came today with the arrival at the Kabul airport of at least 20 Ilyushin-76 heavy jet transports bearing the markings of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. Each aircraft is capable of carrying 25 to 30 tons of supplies, and the takeoffs and landings continued from early morning until past nightfall. Pressure on Bush Is Seen **********Apart from stiffening the Government forces at Jalalabad, who have held on to the strategic city through 11 days of what has been described as the most intensive fighting in the war, the Soviet decision to send in new arms supplies appears designed to put pressure on the Bush Administration for an agreement to cut off weapons shipments to the guerrillas and to Kabul. **********A proposal for an arms cutoff was originally made by the United States a year ago, and rejected by the Kremlin. It was revived by Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the United Nations in December, and renewed in a message to President Bush on Feb. 17, but Mr. Bush rejected it on the basis that the Kremlin had transferred large stockpiles of arms to its allies as Soviet troops pulled out. **********Afghan Government officials who asked not to be identified used the stepped-up Soviet supplies as an occasion to press the main emphasis of their policy since the Soviet troops left. The officials seek an arms accord that would see both sides return their stockpiles to their foreign suppliers and negotiations under American and Soviet auspices for a colition government. **********Evidence that weapons may have been coming in aboard the Ilyushin-76's included the fact that Western reporters' appointment with a guard unit at the military end of the airport was canceled when they arrived at the gates, a few hundred yards from where the jet transports were unloading. **********In addition, Soviet representatives here have told Western reporters in recent days that a Kremlin decision has been made to step up arms supplies in light of the fighting at Jalalabad. **********In an interview at the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday with the BBC, a high-ranking embassy official said the arms supplies had been stepped up at the Afghan Government's request. The Talk of Kabul **********The sudden rush of Ilyushin transports today was the talk of Kabul, a city sensitized by nearly 10 years of war to anything affecting daily life. Merchants in the bazaars and women joining the large crowds that gather outside bakeries awaiting daily bread deliveries gazed skyward at the blue-and-white jets as they banked into the steep spirals that aircraft approaching Kabul fly in an effort to evade the American-supplied Stinger missiles the guerrillas use. **********Every Soviet aircraft landing and taking off drops dozens of magnesium heat flares as a precaution against heat-seeking missiles, and today, with brilliantly clear skies reaching to the snow-capped mountains ringing the city, the flares made a constant but menacing display. The flares have caused many fires in Kabul's outer districts, killing and injuring residents. **********The Ilyushins were a common sight above the city up to the Soviet troop pullout, when they were used to ferry last-minute supplies to the Government and to take out Soviet soldiers and their equipment. But after Feb. 15 they disappeared, and were not seen again until a few days after the Jalalabad battle began on March 5."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/23/business/dawkins-to-join-bain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dawkins to Join Bain", "print_headline": "Dawkins to Join Bain", "body_text": " **********Peter M.

James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee. ''This shows the disarray in the Polish hierarchy. Cardinal Glemp's statement undermines a solemn promise, and by saying that the church leaders who signed the 1987 accord were hurried into it, he challenges a lot of Catholics who acted very carefully.'' **********Rabbi Jack Bemporad, chairman of the interreligious affairs committee of the Synagogue Council of America, also saw a deep split among Polish bishops reflected in Cardinal Glemp's assertion that the European churchmen who negotiated the 1987 accord, including Franciszek Cardinal Macharski of Cracow, were not empowered to agree to the convent's relocation. **********The convent is in Cardinal Macharski's archdiocese. **********''My fundamental feeling is that Catholic leadership, here and in Europe, is in favor of moving the nuns out,'' the rabbi said. Although Cardinal Glemp may call for renegotion, he said, ''in the long run, the agreement cannot really be renegotiated.'' **********''This has been blown all out of proportion,'' Rabbi Bemporad said. ''The Catholic hierarchy has to be given time, and all this going to the brink is not very helpful.'' **********American Catholic leaders continue to press for fulfillment of the agreement to move the convent to an interfaith center to be constructed away from the Auschwitz grounds, even though Cardinal Macharski backed away from the accord last month. **********On Thursday, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said moving the convent would end the ''bewilderment and anguish'' it had caused. He also endorsed the statement by John Cardinal O'Connor of New York that Cardinal Glemp's remarks on Aug. 27 were ''harmful and distressing.'' Cardinal Glemp had criticized Jewish objections to the convent's location, implied that Jewish protesters intended to kill the nuns and referred to Jewish power in the world's press. **********In a column in Friday's issue of Boston's Catholic paper, The Pilot, Bernard Cardinal Law appealed to the Carmelite nuns at Auschwitz to ''go the extra mile'' and move the convent of their own accord. Cardinal Law said the nuns' convent had been established ''in good faith.'' But he wrote that it had become ''for some a symbol of insensitivity to the Jews,'' and added, ''There is little hope of an early resolution except by a gracious act of reconciling love which only you can make.'' **********Catholic officials, who asked not to be identified, said Cardinal Glemp's latest remarks added to earlier fears that his planned visit to the United States late in September would deepen Catholic-Jewish tensions over the convent. Cardinal Glemp is to visit Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Chicago. Jewish groups in those cities are discussing the appropirateness of demonstrations as well as of invitations to meet with the Polish Cardinal. **********Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, international consultant to the American Jewish Committee, raised the possibility that Cardinal Glemp's call for renegotiating the 1987 accord was ''potentially a positive development.'' **********''It certainly moves beyond the demagogic and truculent position that Cardinal Glemp took a week ago,'' Rabbi Tanenbaum said, suggesting that the Cardinal might be responding to criticism of his earlier remarks by Solidarity and other Poles. **********''Given the deadlock situation of a week ago, this could be a potential turning point,'' Rabbi Tanenbaum said. ''The question is whether his earlier positions mean that new negotiations would be worthless.'' **********''The heart of the issue is that both Poles and Jews have been terrible victims,'' he said.

Skinner recently launched an ambitious program to develop a well-articulated national transportation policy. His effort will be appraised in no small measure by his ability to find the right role for high-speed rail in some of the nation's saturated corridors. **********For many of our industrialized trading partners this exciting technology is already an essential element of their transportation infrastructure. For example, the high-speed French Train a Grande Vitesse, call the T.G.V., has operated regularly in the Paris-Lyon corridor at 168 miles per hour since 1981. The T.G.V. passed its 100 million passenger mark this spring, and it makes money. This fall, a second-generation T.G.V. will be inaugurated to the Atlantic coast of France, with cruising speeds in excess of 185 m.p.h. **********By the early part of the next decade, T.G.V. electrified service will link the continent to Britain, and a strong European high-speed rail network will be in place. With improvements in technology, cruising speeds well over 200 m.p.h. will be attainable. **********By contrast, the United States is a comparative primitive. Our closest contender is Amtrak's New York-Washington Metroliner service, operating at speeds up to 125 m.p.h. Excellent service by our standards, but not at the cutting edge. **********Can the United States have a ''Starlight Express'' in the real world, or are we confined to Broadway musicals? **********The answer, so far, must be put in the conditional tense. The technology exists, and the need exists. The uncertainty lies in the area of political will. **********Any analysis must begin with a heavy dose of realism. High-speed rail (150 m.p.h.) is not functional over short distances. It is not a commuter-oriented mass-transit system. Nor does high-speed rail belong on very long routes, Chicago and Los Angeles, for instance. In any rational transportation system, the long-distance market goes to jet aircraft. **********On the other hand, high-speed rail is just the thing for certain corridors between 250 and 400 miles where environmental and economic factors militate against the more conventional options. **********Medium-distance candidate corridors are characterized by heavy travel densities and the present or easily foreseeable saturation of the existing infrastructure. In some cases, the creation of a high-speed rail spine in the corridor also becomes an invaluable instrument of growth management. **********An excellent example of the first characteristic is the New York-Washington corridor. No rational projection for the future can include another turnpike, or more runways. Simulations already show that elapsed times of just over two hours for the route are attainable with only modest improvements to Amtrak's right of way. Even with relatively conventional technology, Amtrak has shown that people want and need this service. We should aim at state-of-the-art technology for this route. **********THE Miami-Orlando-Tampa corridor shows how high-speed rail fits the bill for growth management as well as transportation needs. Explosive growth is on a collision course with an already overburdened infrastructure. Because Florida's environment is so perilously fragile, clean and energy-efficient high-speed rail along existing rights of way is the answer. Further, by clustering development along the corridor, high-speed service can curtail the helter-skelter urban sprawl that so threatens that state. **********Tempering this promise is the fact that political will is as important as demonstrable need. Even though they are cost effective, high-speed rail systems are vast projects and can come into being only as the result of a strong commitment by public authorities. **********That commitment may take a variety of forms. For example, the French national railroad, floated bonds in the private sector to build the Paris-Lyon line. Those bonds will be paid off ahead of schedule, but the bond issue probably would have failed had the French Government not guaranteed it. **********In the same fashion, private capital can be attracted to high-speed rail projects. But private investment alone will not create these systems any more than private investment alone created our highway and airway networks. Investors must view the body politic as a friend of high-speed rail, and not as a competitor. **********We Americans are not going to abandon our automobiles or board up the windows of our control towers. No country where high-speed rail exists has. But, like them, we should look at all the options and invest in new technologies wherever they offer the highest return. For that reason, high-speed rail should not be dismissed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/business/company-news-colgate-palmolive-to-acquire-vipont.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Colgate-Palmolive To Acquire Vipont", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Colgate-Palmolive To Acquire Vipont", "body_text": " **********The Colgate-Palmolive Company will acquire Vipont Pharmaceutical Inc. for about $94 million, enabling Colgate to strengthen its oral hygiene product line.

Morgan Stanley told the board that the offer was inadequate and advised it to seek alternatives, the spokesman added. Effect on Stock Price **********Vitro bid $20 a share, or about $280 million, on Aug. 9 for Anchor, the nation's second-largest maker of glass containers. Anchor stock closed unchanged yesterday at $20 on the New York Stock Exchange but is up from less than $10 the week before the offer. **********The analysts who follow Anchor said a leveraged buyout or recapitalization was unlikely because Anchor has $460 million in debt and doubted that Anchor would find a suitor willing to top Vitro's offer. The analysts said that other United States glass container manufacturers would be hampered in a takeover effort by antitrust concerns and that Anchor would not be attractive to other foreign buyers. Anchor did not identify the third parties with which it was negotiating. **********''I don't know of anybody who is interested in buying Anchor Glass Container, and I don't think anybody would pay more than $20 a share,'' said Edward Schollmeyer, an analyst at Paine Webber. ''What you're watching here is a tremendous poker game.'' **********Vitro replied sharply to the rejection by Anchor, saying it reserved the right to re-evaluate the offer in light of Anchor's decaying financial position. ''The decision by the Anchor board to respond to our offer by adopting a poison pill suggests that the board will try to deprive the Anchor shareholders of the opportunity to accept our $20 offer,'' a company spokesman said. **********Vitro made the nonnegotiable offer through the THR Corporation, a Nevada-based company that Vitro formed to make the acquisition. **********Anchor also said it had unanimously adopted a shareholder rights plan that provides for a distribution of preferred stock purchase rights to be distributed to stockholders. One purchase right will be given for each common share held at the end of business on Sept. 1. **********The Anchor board also decided to revise the circumstances under which Anchor executives would be entitled to benefits if terminated, allow all stock options to be exercised immediately if the company changes hands, remove the limitations on severance payments to executives, provide additional lump-sum payments and provide executives with other benefits, which include coverage of all office and legal expenses. An Attractive Premium **********Vitro's bid, which expires on Sept. 7, was widely perceived by analysts as an attractive premium for the troubled company. Anchor, which carries nearly $500 million in long-term debt after a 1983 leveraged buyout of the company, is in default on some bank agreements. The company, which went public again in 1986, has been losing money as the market for glass containers is shrinking because of competition with plastics. **********Anchor reported an $8.5 million loss on revenue of $978 million last year. So far this year, Anchor lost about $14.5 million. The company has said it needs nearly $100 million a year for the next several years for capital reinvestment. **********''We thought the original offer made by Vitro was a generous one and we assume that higher offers are unlikely,'' said Richard Palm, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''I have assumed that the deal was highly likely to go through because Vitro has the financing and I don't think they would have any antitrust problems,'' Mr. Palm added. **********Vitro has hired some impressive Wall Street talent in its bid for Anchor, including Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Lazard Freres and Cravath, Swaine & Moore."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/business/executive-changes-353989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 281, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Bonnie Doon Inc., Stamford, Conn., a maker of women's and children's hosiery, named Martin B.

R. Tripler on Madison Avenue, a small retailer is trying to capture a bit of sunlight by saying ''G'day, mate'' to shoppers seeking traditional sportswear. **********The greeting comes from Country Road, a fast-growing clothing manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer that runs its business from a brick and wood building on the site of an old weaving mill in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. **********As one American expatriate in Melbourne said, it seems preposterous that an Australian clothing company that borrowed America's preppy look would think of exporting it back to the source. But that is just what Country Road is doing. **********''Australia's Country Road has finally come to America,'' its advertisements and posters proclaim. A Rapid Expansion **********Since fall, in addition to the store on Madison Avenue and 43d Street, Country Road has opened others at some of the most competitive retail centers in the Northeast: the South Street Seaport in New York; Short Hills, N.J.; Stamford, Conn.; Pittsburgh, and two in Boston. Others are to open this fall in Westport, Conn., and Columbus, Ohio, and stores may soon follow in Washington and Chicago. If the initial effort is successful, there may be a chain of more than two dozen in three or four years. **********Country Road was founded in 1974 by Stephen R. Bennett with one product line: shirts that women could pair with the then widely popular blue jeans. Mr. Bennett, whose focus is on fabric development and styling, brought in his sister, Jane I. Parker, a year later to manage product design and development. They were soon joined by Peter A. Vial, who had spent eight years in investment and merchant banking. **********By 1980, the collection had expanded to include more women's apparel, distributed in Australia's leading department and specialty stores and in 10 Country Road stores. A year later Australia's biggest department store group, Myer Emporium Ltd., bought the company - which in 1982 had modest sales of $16 million (Australian), or $12 million (United States) - but kept the management team in place. **********Country Road rapidly expanded to 39 stores and 7 outlets under the name Second Best, which sold samples, seconds and surplus stocks. By 1984, sales - including a new men's wear line - had nearly doubled, to $31 million (Australian). In the next two years the number of stores stretched to 50 and sales nearly doubled again, to $59 million. Founders Regain Control **********A stock listing in 1987 allowed the founders to recapture control, and Mr. Vial became managing director. **********In the first fiscal year after the company went public, its sales soared 35.8 percent, to $113.4 million, and net operating profit jumped 36.4 percent, to $7.2 million. **********While Australia is about the size of the United States, it has a population of only 16.3 million, with average yearly earnings of $24,000. So the executives at Country Road, which now has 800 employees and nearly 60 stores in the top retail centers of Australia and New Zealand, became eager to expand. **********''We thought about America and England,'' Mr. Vial said. ''We felt that America had more potential. **********''We chose the East Coast because it had a more professional market. We said, 'Let's go and play hardball from day one.' '' Muted Colors **********The stores in the United States mimic the flavor of those in Australia. Dusty pale-gray walls, bleached wood and pebbly-looking tile floors create the background for casual clothes that range from blue jeans and sweatshirts to suits and dresses. **********Because the clothes, with muted colors, do not stand out against the neutral background, posters as high as three or four feet made from the company's magazine advertisements and catalogues provide visual focal points. **********The stores in the United States sell both women's and men's clothing -about 65 percent to 35 percent, respectively. ''There is an increasing trend for men and women to shop together,'' Mr. Vial said. ''At least 60 to 70 percent of men's wear purchases are either made by women or strongly influenced by women. We're trying to create a relaxed, open environment in the stores where people will walk in and feel comfortable, not intimidated.'' **********Ignoring his well-known neighbors across the street, as well as chains like the Gap and Banana Republic, and catalogue retailers like L. L. Bean and Lands' End, Mr. Vial said Country Road's competition was Ralph Lauren and Barneys. But Mr. Bennett, now the executive chairman, said that comparison was not quite right. Ralph Lauren ''loves yesterday,'' he once said, while the Country Road image is of ''today and tomorrow.'' Entering the Unknown **********In Australia, analysts are a bit nervous about Country Road's expansion. America is the unknown, Mr. Vial said, and the perception is that its fashions are different. The company expects to lose money on its United States operations for three or four years. The stores need to be open a complete season to get a good reading, Mr. Vial said, but so far he is satisfied with customer reaction. **********Deirdre Ziruk, who had worked for Talbots and is now in charge of store development for Country Road, said customers were getting to know the stores through the window displays.

L'Esperance and Dr. Stephen L. Trokel. Both claim to have invented the technology in the early 1980's.

Instead, the beams break chemical bonds and allow eye cells to be washed away without causing damage to surrounding tissue.

Cablevision did carry MSG's coverage of Knick and Ranger playoff games this spring as part of its basic service. **********With the agreement, last night's Yankees' game with the Detroit Tigers was available to those households. **********The compromise provides that in areas where the MSG Network had been carried as part of the basic service before the dispute, it will again be carried as a basic service through the 1990 baseball season. **********After that time, Cablevision will have the right to impose a premium for MSG, although its fee may not exceed the premium for its Sportschannel network. **********In Cablevision systems where MSG had been offered as a premium service, it will be available on that basis. **********The MSG Network, a division of Paramount Communications Inc., and Cablevision would not disclose the financial details of their agreement. **********The dispute reflected a nationwide battle between providers of cable services and operators of local systems over access to sports broadcasts and how the cost of such coverage will be passed on to viewers. **********The MSG-Cablevision settlement came four days after the New York State Senate unanimously passed a bill making it illegal for a cable system to drop a service that it had advertised and guaranteed to subscribers. The Assembly already passed the bill, which now goes to Gov. Mario Cuomo. **********Without the settlement, Cablevision might have had to refund as much as $10 million in installation fees to its subscribers. Cablevision, which is based in Woodbury, L.I., has 750,000 subscribers in the New York metropolitan area. **********In December, MSG paid the New York Yankees $500 million for the right to show 75 games this season and next, and 150 games a year for the next 10 years. **********Cablevision's Sportschannel, which is available only as a premium service, carries some games of the New York Mets, the New York Islanders, the New Jersey Devils and the New Jersey Nets. **********MSG insisted that its service be available as part of any basic package. Under such an arrangement, system operators pay a per-subscriber fee to MSG. That would give MSG income to offset its investment in rights to games, as well as a larger audience that would let it charge higher advertising rates. **********Cablevision insisted that MSG be a premium service. After the deadlock, Cablevision dropped MSG in parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. **********The legislation approved by the State Senate on Saturday, the Cable Refund Act of 1989, requires cable operators to provide customers with refunds equal to installation charges when an operator drops a network that was a ''substantial inducement.'' **********''Subscribers who are not sports fans will not be charged for the service, so this programming will not apply pressure to their rates,'' said James A. Kofalt, the president for operations for Cablevision. ''The settlement preserves the principle that each household should have the right not to subscribe to the most expensive services. This principle gains in importance as more and more services become available to cable.'' **********And Robert Gutkowski, the executive vice president of the MSG Communications Group, said: ''There are a lot of people pleased by this agreement and we certainly are. It was a compromise that was helped along by Senator Alfonse D'Amato through two months of keeping the negotiations on track and by the consumer-oriented bill in the State Legislature. **********''What we feel particularly good about is that we will be marketed by Cablevision the same way as Sportschannel, our competitor that is owned by Cablevision.'' **********Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, the Westchester Democrat who sponsored the bill in the lower house, said: ''I think it's clear the bill had the effect we wanted. Yankee fans were a pawn in the power struggle between two monopolies.'' **********Mr. Gutkowski of MSG said: ''Cablevision is doing away with the idea of basic service. It is looking at interest clusters for the future.'' **********Interest clusters are groups of related programming, like shows for children, or about news and information, or sports. MSG Network might appear in a cluster on Cablevision with ESPN, a cable sports network owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Sportschannel. It might also be included in higher-level packages that offer premium services on a discounted basis. **********In April, three major cable systems in New York City agreed to carry MSG's Yankee games in their basic service.

Brady will make a debt policy speech today that officials say will disclose the policy's new directions. **********Officials say Mr. Brady will emphasize finding ways to reduce the nations' burden of debt and of making payments on it, a departure from the current approach that has let both grow. **********A senior Administration official added that Mr. Brady would also propose ''credit enhancements'' to encourage banks to make loans to speed the countries' economic development. These, he implied, would include loan guarantees, with which the World Bank or other agencies would assure payment if the debtor reneged. **********The delay in the change, as well as the slowly emerging substance of it, is largely the work of two officials, one at the Treasury and one at the Fed, whose institutional interests sometimes diverge, as they have in the redefinition of the debt policy. **********In various ways, the Treasury official wanted the Fed to revise its bank regulations to give more banks greater incentive to swallow losses on the debt than the Fed official would allow. **********''The Treasury has recommended actions of a regulatory nature, and the Fed has disagreed,'' Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York, said he had learned from discussions with the Treasury. **********''The Fed stiffed the Treasury,'' is how a senior Congressional aide put it. **********One of the two is David C. Mulford, a 51-year-old Illinoisan who has a Ph.D. in African studies from Oxford. President Bush is promoting him from Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, a job he was recruited for in 1984, to Under Secretary, international. **********In the international economic community, Mr. Mulford is known as a hard-line free-marketer, but in his effort to overhaul the debt policy, he has shown a softer edge. **********The other is Edwin M. Truman, a 47-year-old Ph.D. economist from Yale and former associate professor there, who has been at the Fed for 16 years. He is Alan Greenspan's right-hand man on all international matters, as he was to the previous Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker. He is known as a hard-liner, too, but has also been willing to bend a bit. Both Have Long Experience **********Mr. Truman, at the Fed, and Mr. Mulford, at the Treasury and in his previous nine-year stint in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as investment manager of the kingdom's petrodollars, have long experience with the nearly seven-year-old third-world debt crisis, far longer than Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Brady. **********So except for occasional participation by Mr. Brady; Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the author of the expiring policy when he was Treasury Secretary, and Robert B. Zoellick, a close aide of Mr. Baker, Mr. Mulford and Mr. Truman have controlled the policy overhaul. Only in the last few weeks have other parties come to the table. **********Neither Mr. Mulford nor Mr. Truman discusses the differences, on the record or off, that arose in the development of the debt policy. But there were ''important differences,'' according to an associate of the two men. Behind the Differences **********The differences come down to how each man views the responsibilities of the institution he represents. The Fed sees its principal responsibility as maintaining the integrity of the American banking system. In this view, no debt policy can work without a sound banking system. **********The Bush Administration respects the need for a sound banking system but says too much emphasis can be put on this over keeping the burden of a developing country's debt from becoming the catalyst of leftist or populist revolutions. **********Without commenting on the attitude of the Fed, Brazil's Ambassador to the United States, Marcilio Marques Moreira, said, ''I have felt at the Treasury a general interest in going as far as possible in reducing debt and still being realistic.'' **********According to people familiar with the Fed and the Treasury's work, a major difference involved the cushion that banks have against possible loan losses. Banks must set aside a percentage of their loan portfolios to reflect the uncertainty that loans will be repaid. To build a reserve, a bank creates an expense in its accounts and reduces its earnings correspondingly. This also has a positive effect in raising the bank's capital. **********Mr. Mulford wanted the Fed to modify these regulations to encourage banks to sell more of their developing country debt, by such means as converting it to bonds to sell in the secondary market or selling it back to the debtor country. Either way, the bank would have to accept a much-reduced, market-related valuation of the loan - 50 percent or more in the case of many countries' debt. **********To encourage banks to go along, officials say, Mr. Mulford proposed that the Fed require banks that did not participate in such sales to set aside larger reserves on their third world loans. Threat to Banking System Seen **********Officials say that Mr. Truman objected to this device and a number of Mulford proposals on the ground that they posed hazards for the integrity of the banking system. Troubled banks that did not go along with the debt conversion plans might find themselves forced irretrievably into the red. Since the Fed is an independent agency of the Government, there was nothing Mr. Mulford could do to force it to go along. **********All this is tied into another related area of difference involving how much debt reduction and how much new lending to support. **********The Treasury and the Fed both now accept the idea that the overall debt load - $1.3 trillion in all forms of debt of all developing countries - should be reduced. Both still see utility in encouraging new lending, as encouraged under the ''Baker Plan,'' but differ on the level of such aid. **********A senior Administration official cautioned that it was too early to declare the Fed a victor in the talks over the debt policy, which will continue long after Mr. Brady's speech. ''I wouldn't bet the book is entirely closed,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/business/business-people-comex-officer-citing-hardships-quits-post.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Hylton", "pub_date": "1989-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 456, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Comex Officer, Citing Hardships, Quits Post", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Comex Officer, Citing Hardships, Quits Post", "body_text": " **********Responding to what he said were ''great demands'' on his personal time and finances, John H.

Cable System Sale Seen **********Because Warner owns a minority stake in BHC Inc., which owns the television station KCOP in Los Angeles, Time would probably have to sell a cable system in Southern California with about 20,000 customers, the officials said. They said that was the only divestiture expected. **********Mr. Ross said he expected it would take four months to gain regulatory approvals, principally from local governments on cable franchises. He and the other executives said they expected no antitrust problems. **********The officials also said that neither company would buy any of its own shares in the open market before the merger is completed, adding that such purchases could jeopardize the tax-free nature of the transaction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/29/business/international-report-even-the-best-of-times-are-tough-in-zambia.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1989-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Even the Best of Times Are Tough in Zambia", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; Even the Best of Times Are Tough in Zambia", "body_text": " **********Accidents that would be mere inconveniences in other countries become disasters in Zambia, underscoring the fragility of an economy that totters on the brink of ruin in the best of times. **********When a fire at a Zambian oil refinery disrupted gasoline supplies early in May, thousands of people were stranded when some taxis and buses stopped running for lack of fuel, and desperate motorists, facing long lines at service stations, paid exorbitant sums for premium gasoline doled out by youths from jerrycans. **********In March, when a fire gutted a hydroelectric plant in the Kafue Gorge, Zambia became a net importer of electricity. The Zambians, who had been selling 350 megawatts of electricity to neighboring Zimbabwe for $1 million a week, now buy 130 megawatts from Zimbabwe and Zaire, and neighborhoods in Lusaka take turns enduring blackouts. 'They Still Got Poor' **********Even favorable news in Zambia often has an unfavorable side. In 1988, the nation's economy grew 2.2 percent as copper prices bounced back after years of decline and near-perfect weather brought a bumper harvest. But per-capita income dropped because Zambia's population of 7.5 million had grown 3.6 percent. **********''They had ideal conditions and they still got poor,'' a Western economist said. **********Faced with an array of problems, including unemployment and inflation, President Kenneth D. Kaunda, who was elected to a sixth term last October, is taking steps to bolster the economy. **********President Kaunda has announced a program to resettle those willing to go back to farming, in an effort to make Zambia more self-sufficient and to reduce unemployment. In addition, he has allowed officials of the International Monetary Fund back into Zambia for talks, suggesting that he might reconsider the I.M.F. austerity proposals that he rejected a year ago. Dim Prospects **********At a parade honoring his 65th birthday on April 28, President Kaunda acknowledged that the future looked bleak. ''The state of our economy will remain difficult,'' he said. ''The cost of living will keep on rising and prospects of employment will remain dim. We should guard against this through hard work on the land.'' **********Historically, the erratic price of copper has borne most of the blame for the nation's economic problems. Copper is the leading export of Zambia, generating 86 percent of its export earnings in 1988. But the troubles also stem from the overmanagement, the swollen bureaucracy and the costly price subsidies that are all part of the nation's planned economy, and, not least, from Mr. Kaunda's rejection of the I.M.F. austerity plan. **********Mr. Kaunda's declaration of economic independence dried up I.M.F. loans and discouraged donors of foreign aid, who had injected up to $500 million a year into the country. As a result, Zambia has a a shortage of hard currency at a time when the demand and prices for imports are rising. $550 Lights and $150 Blankets A recent advertisement placed in a Lusaka newspaper offered Peugeot headlights for sale for $550 apiece, without specifying their condition. And in Ndola, imported blankets have sold for as much as $150 each because domestic ones have grown scarce. **********Zambia, which gained independence from Britain in 1964, once relied on high copper prices to sustain its socialist economy and finance a generous social welfare program, including free education and medical care. But in the 1970's, copper prices plummeted and the cost of imported crude oil soared. **********The result was that the Government started to borrow, amassing a foreign debt that totaled $6.6 billion by the end of 1987. Zambia's current arrears on old loans from the I.M.F. is estimated at $792 million. **********The I.M.F. offered harsh remedies to restructure the Zambian economy. They included decontrolling prices, liberalizing foreign trade, trimming back the swollen bureaucracy, freezing government jobs and salaries, and selling Zambia's limited amount of hard foreign currency to the highest bidder. I.M.F. Plan Was Scrapped **********But the unpopular I.M.F. plan was scrapped in May 1987 by Mr. Kaunda, who substituted his own program. A major provision limited the servicing of Zambia's foreign debt to 10 percent of its export earnings, after foreign-exchange costs were deducted for the country's mines, national airline, fertilizer and medicine. **********State companies are allocated hard currency, currently at the rate of 10 Zambian kwachas to the dollar. On the black market in downtown Lusaka, a dollar fetches 30 to 50 kwachas. **********Mr. Kaunda has also refused to reduce price subsidies, recalling the riots that broke out when he tried to double the price of cornmeal in December 1986. Now, Lusaka residents find cornmeal, cooking oil and even beer scarce at the subsidized price. A quart of cooking oil officially costs about $1.60, but shoppers who cannot find it pay up to $7 a quart on the black market. High Inflation **********This has pushed up the inflation rate, now officially 59 percent annually, but unofficially put at closer to 100 percent. ''Logic tells you that if prices haven't changed in two years, the inflation rate is zero,'' the Western economist said. ''But they admit to nearly 60 percent. **********In addition, much of what is grown or made in Zambia gets smuggled to neighboring countries. Zambian economists estimate that at least a third of the nation's corn crop, which is made into a cornmeal mush called nshima, ends up illicitly in Zaire, bringing four or five times more on the free market than the Government-controlled price in Zambia. **********As a result, Zambians who could afford to buy meat or fish a few years ago now put vegetable gravy on their corn meal. ''There's no fat left at all,'' a European diplomat said. ''It's been pared right down.'' Ration Coupons for Cornmeal **********To discourage black marketeering, the Government introduced ration coupons that entitled each person to buy nearly 31 pounds of cornmeal a month at the subsidized price of roughly 5 cents a pound. But Zambians must register each month to qualify. **********One problem for Zambia's Government is that some economic remedies, like a tax increase to reduce its budget deficit, create new problems. For example, 500 employees of the Zambia State Insurance Company staged a sit-in strike after they found that taxes siphoned off up to 80 percent of their wages in April. **********A senior trade union official, Newstead Zimba, has urged that the tax structure be reviewed because it is creating two societies: those who pay their taxes and those who do not. ''Taxes should be paid but they should be reasonable,'' Mr. Zimba said. Little Incentive to Work **********Not surprisingly, private initiative has suffered with the high taxes. ''At the moment, most workers do not care whether they put in an honest eight-hour workday or not,'' Alexander Grey Zulu, the Secretary General of the United National Independence Party, Zambia's sole political party since 1973, told a conference in Kabwe. **********One of the most telling insights into Zambia's hardships came from a newspaper columnist who recommended sweet potatoes as a substitute for bread. **********''In rural centers where bread is not even a subject of discussion, a few people who can manage take their tea with sweet potatoes and I find nothing wrong with that,'' the columnist wrote in The Times of Zambia. ''It is about time Zambians woke up to realize that bread is a luxury we can do without.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/05/world/two-arab-guerrillas-slain-by-israeli-patrol.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Arab Guerrillas Slain by Israeli Patrol", "print_headline": "Two Arab Guerrillas Slain by Israeli Patrol", "body_text": " **********Two Palestinian guerrillas were shot and killed late Tuesday night by Israeli soldiers on a routine patrol in the self-declared Israeli security zone just a few hundred feet from the northern border, an Israeli Army spokesman said today. **********In the occupied territories today, two Palestinians were killed by fellow Palestinians because they were suspected of cooperating with Israel, according to accounts by Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Manuel Antonio Noriega exploded in rage against his captured opponents and ordered the immediate execution of several rebel officers, including a close friend who was the coup leader, diplomats here said today. **********The diplomats, speaking in separate interviews, described a growing body of evidence - from casualty lists to personal accounts to reports of shooting long after the coup had ended - to indicate that the 10 or more rebels who died in the coup were killed deliberately and did not die in battle, as General Noriega's Government has claimed. **********No bodies of those believed to have been killed have yet turned up for public burial, nor have their relatives come forward. Price of Disloyalty **********The diplomats said the killings were the start of a harsh crackdown within the Panamanian military that began with officers connected to the coup but has now spread to include the torture and possible execution of dozens of others in an armywide hunt for traitors. **********Officials of the Noriega regime, while refusing to speak publicly, have strongly denied that any torture or executions have taken place. **********The purpose of the crackdown, the diplomats said, is not only to exact revenge for the failed plot, but to demonstrate in stark terms the price of any future disloyalty to the Panamanian leader. **********''Noriega is letting them know that no one should even think of trying something like this again,'' said a diplomat. ''He is sending the message the way he knows best.'' Reprisals to Be Expected **********Diplomats said that reprisals were to be expected for so serious an uprising, but they expressed surprise at the scope and brutality of the crackdown, which began almost immediately after General Noriega was rescued by loyal forces at his military headquarters among the narrow streets of downtown Panama City. **********They say the purge has sent shock waves through the ranks of the armed forces, which have long been the most powerful institution in the country and General Noriega's principal source of authority. **********The precise details of the coup attempt and its aftermath remain sketchy, because they were witnessed by only a handful of people - most of whom were killed, imprisoned or are direct participants loyal to General Noriega. Contradictions in Official Version **********But diplomats and other foreign analysts say that the official Panamanian version of events has several contradictions, reinforcing assertions that many coup participants were executed after surrendering. Suspicions have been supported by accounts from members and relatives of military personnel who observed some or all the events. **********According to official Panamanian military figures, 10 soldiers died in the coup attempt and 26 people were wounded, including 5 civilians. But diplomats and military analysts have pointed out that, despite a pitched battle with automatic weapons and mortars, the Government figures report no deaths among the soldiers loyal to General Noriega. **********In the battle for control of the headquarters building, the forces loyal to General Noriega were forced to attack entrenched rebel positions, a disadvantage that, according to military analysts, should have been expected to cost the attacking forces roughly three times as many casualties as those suffered by the rebels. Casualty Figures in Question **********The diplomats noted that the Government's casualty figures, published two days after the coup attempt, show that all but two of the dead men were officers, and the others were sergeants, suggesting that no lower rank enlisted men were killed, even though hundreds were seen to be involved in the fight. **********Part of the discrepancy, the diplomats suggested, could be explained by the Government's reluctance to acknowledge the total number of casualties, which some Panamanians with contacts in the military say reach at least 25 dead and as many as 100 wounded. Government spokesmen have played down the scale of the revolt, which General Noriega has repeatedly described as ''tiny.'' **********But the Government figures appear to correspond to a growing body of testimony from members of the military, their relatives and others who witnessed all or part of the events, suggesting that most of the rebels did not die in battle, but were executed in what one European diplomat described as an ''explosion of rage'' by General Noriega. **********''Three or four were killed in the fighting and the rest were executed afterward,'' the diplomat said. ''There was no doubt about it.'' Gunfire Heard Into the Night **********The timing of the reported executions, several diplomats noted, corresponds with gunfire that could be heard echoing from the headquarters as late as midnight, long after the coup was foiled in mid-afternoon. **********According to some accounts, General Noriega executed some conspirators, including the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, despite close ties between the two men. Panamanians acquainted with the two officers said that General Noriega had served as godfather to one of Major Giroldi's children, and that the major had recently attended the christening of one of General Noriega's grandchildren. **********But the diplomats noted they had received conflicting accounts on General Noriega's personal involvement in the executions. **********Since the coup Tuesday, Panamanians with contacts inside the defense forces have described a sweeping crackdown on officers and troops suspected of complicity, and diplomats said that they had received direct testimony describing torture of those arrested. According to at least two foreign officials, some officers listed as arrested have now been executed. Stakes of Betrayal **********After a coup attempt in March 1988, the leaders of which remain in prison, General Noriega reportedly declared to associates that any future plotters would meet a far harsher fate. **********Diplomats familiar with the Panamanian military say that they believe that the stakes of betrayal have risen higher for both General Noriega and his potential enemies. **********''The lesson here for Noriega is that any future coup will begin with his death,'' said a foreign official. ''This crowd lost because they let him live. No one will ever make that mistake again, and he knows it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/business/what-s-new-in-the-liquor-business-building-an-arsenal-of-brands-to-survive.html": {"writer_name": "Patricia Winters", "pub_date": "1989-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUILDING AN ARSENAL OF BRANDS TO SURVIVE", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN THE LIQUOR BUSINESS; BUILDING AN ARSENAL OF BRANDS TO SURVIVE", "body_text": " **********Dwindling consumer demand for liquor is forcing distillers to consolidate. Last year 12 companies, led by Britain's Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. and the Seagram Company Ltd., based in Montreal, controlled 72 percent of all liquor sales in the United States - up from 67 percent in 1984, according to Mr. Maxwell. ''When you have a maturing market, you have consolidation,'' he said. **********In 1986, RJR Nabisco Inc., the food and tobacco concern, sold Heublein Inc. to Grand Metropolitan, which is now the world's largest liquor concern. More recently, the National Distillers Company, which created the peach schnapps craze a few years ago, divested itself of its wine and liquor holdings to concentrate on its chemical business. And in May, after losing a leadership position in a tough brandy war to giant E & J Gallo Winery, the Christian Brothers sold all of its alcohol holdings - wines and brandy - to Grand Metropolitan. **********Some distillers are simply minimizing their exposure by diversifying. For instance, the Brown-Forman Corporation, which makes Jack Daniel's and Early Times bourbon, no longer views itself as a traditional bourbon distiller from Louisville, Ky., but rather as a marketer of ''fine quality consumer products.'' **********The company owns Lenox Inc., a maker of china and crystal, and in June agreed to acquire a majority interest in Compagnie des Cristalleries de Saint-Louis, the French crystal house. Consumer products accounted for 22 percent of the company's sales of $1.3 billion in the year that ended April 30. **********Many major players, however, are acquiring liquor interests to broaden their product offerings, gain operating efficiencies and increase their distribution clout. After all, retailers prefer dealing with as few wholesalers as possible - those with the broadest product lines and the lowest prices. Likewise, distillers with those qualities stand on firmer ground with wholesalers. **********The once-staid Seagram has gone through a whirlwind of change over the past several years. With recent acquisitions like the Tropicana Products Company and the prestigious House of Martell cognac, Seagram has transformed itself from a liquor giant into an international beverage company. While the juice business positions Seagram in a growing industry, the Martell acquisition offers presence in important foreign markets and helps complete its portfolio of premium liquors. **********Likewise, foreign distillers have been buying up the importers that market their brands worldwide. For example, in late 1987, Guinness P.L.C., which is tied with Seagram as the world's largest whisky distiller, bought Schenley Industries, its American distributor of Dewar's and the sixth-largest liquor company in the United States. **********The acquisitions give foreign companies better control over their costs and brand strategies. Soon afer purchasing Schenley, for instance, Guinness attempted to improve the image of its Pinch brand of scotch, which had lanquished. It increased advertising, restored a wire mesh covering on the bottle that had been removed because of its expense and discontinued couponing, which had eroded the brand's premium image. **********These acquisitions are also giving foreign companies increasing influence in the American market. Today, all but four of the nation's top ten liquor companies are foreign-owned, according to Mr. Walters of Shanken. That is double the number three years ago. **********And the clout of foreign distillers is expanding. To strengthen their brand portfolios and give them more leverage with wholesalers and retailers without incurring the cost of an acquisition, some companies are forging marketing alliances. For instance, in 1987, Guinness P.L.C. and Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, a French distiller of cognac and champagne, teamed up to jointly market and distribute their brands in America, Europe and the Far East. In America, they are marketing liquor through the Schieffelin & Somerset Company, an importer they jointly own. **********''It's one of the most important agreements we've made,'' said Christopher Davidson, director of public affairs at Guinness. **********With stronger world powers in liquor, the smaller distiller has become an endangered species. One of the few left in this country, seventh-ranking Glenmore Distilleries, a Louisville bourbon maker, is banking on building a niche in mid-priced brands. Last year, Glenmore acquired two liquor companies that sell bourbon, gin and vodka to middle-income Americans. ''To compete effectively, it's necessary to obtain a certain critical mass,'' said Frank Casciari, president of Glenmore."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/16/world/sudanese-jets-suspected-in-raid-on-uganda.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sudanese Jets Suspected in Raid on Uganda", "print_headline": "Sudanese Jets Suspected in Raid on Uganda", "body_text": " **********Relief workers in Uganda said a warplane they suspected of belonging to the Sudanese Air Force bombed a town in northern Uganda today, destroying several government buildings but causing no casualties. **********The relief workers, reached by telephone from Nairobi, said a MIG-19 camouflaged in brown and green had dropped four bombs during two passes over the town of Moyo, about 11 miles from the Sudanese border. **********They quoted witnesses as saying a second MIG-19 flew at higher altitude to provide cover. **********The relief workers said there were similar air raids on the towns of Yirol and Watt in the southern Sudan two weeks ago.

''People will just wait until things go on sale.'' A 'Weak Note' **********The Commerce Department said that spending, reflecting plummeting automobile sales in October, dropped two-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.53 trillion, after edging up only three-tenths of 1 percent in September. **********It was the first decline in personal spending since a one-tenth of 1 percent drop in September 1988 and the steepest since a 1.4 percent fall in January 1987. **********Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, and the spending report provided fresh evidence that the economy is continuing to slow. **********''Consumer spending is starting the fourth quarter on an extremely weak note,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G.

''Generally the market gave a pretty good performance until early September, and then it foundered.'' **********On the New York Stock Exchange, the Spain Fund, a closed-end fund that invests in the booming Spanish market, rose 168.4 percent as Japanese investors bought it heavily. The fund, which was the largest percentage gainer on the exchange in the quarter, has been valued at a hefty premium to its asset value. Similar Funds Thrive **********The sharp rise in the Spain Fund pulled up other single-country funds. The Germany Fund ended the quarter with a 67.7 percent gain. On the American Stock Exchange, the First Iberian Fund posted an 84.5 percent gain. **********Leading the Big Board losers was the Lomas Financial Corporation of Dallas, which lost 77.1 percent of its market value and ended the third quarter at $2 a share. Late last month, Lomas became one of the largest financial services companies to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. It halted payments on $2.1 billion of debt held by 47 creditors. **********On the American Stock Exchange, the biggest loser was Sorg Inc., a financial printer that also filed for bankruptcy protection in the quarter. The company never fully recovered from the drop in financial printing after the October 1987 stock market collapse. **********The biggest gainer on the Amex was the Graham Corporation, a Batavia, N.Y., company that designs vacuum and heat transfer industrial equipment. The company, which rose 235.8 percent, to end the quarter at $37.375, reported sharply higher second-quarter profits and announced that it would resume its quarterly dividend payment of 5 cents a share. **********In the quarter, advancing stocks on the Big Board, the Amex, and the over-the-counter market led declining issues 3,124 to 1,880, with 275 unchanged, according to Media General Financial Services. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, rising stocks led losers by a margin of more than 2 to 1, with 1,038 up, 513 down and 54 unchanged. In the over-the-counter market, 1,692 were up, 1,064 were down and 189 unchanged. On the Amex, 394 stocks rose and 303 fell, with 32 unchanged. **********On the over-the-counter market, Energy Ventures Inc., a Houston oil and gas exploration company, was the largest gainer. The stock had a 200 percent gain, ending at $37.50, after a London investment firm increased its stake in the company. **********The big over-the-counter loser was the Pantera's Corporation, which fell 90 percent, to end the quarter at 50 cents after the St. Louis fast-food restaurant company filed for bankruptcy protection. Dow Industrials Up 10.36% **********Despite a slight decline in September, the market made strong gains in the third quarter, which ended Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.36 percent for the quarter, and 24.17 for the year to date. The Dow fell slightly in September, largely because of jitters in the high-yield junk bond market that depressed stock prices, particularly those of takeover stocks. **********The junk bond market was seriously rattled after the Campeau Corporation, a Canadian developer, defaulted on some of the interest on debt it accumulated to acquire two major United States retailers in a leveraged buyout. **********''Notwithstanding September's moderate decline, it has been a good quarter,'' said Steven Einhorn, chief portfolio strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''It was an admirable showing given the turmoil that developed in the junk and L.B.O. markets. September should be viewed as a slight interruption.'' **********Mr. Einhorn added that despite these weaknesses, the market's advance was still on solid ground. **********Positive economic data helped to maintain investors' faith in the market, analysts said. Among these, the unemployment figures for August were lower than many expected, while inflation appeared to be under control. **********''The economy demonstrated that we're not going into a recession for 1989,'' said Monte Gordon, an analyst with the Dreyfus Corporation. ''The inflation risks obviously have been overblown, and the dollar has not lost its allure and attractiveness to foreign investors.'' **********Takeover activity also propelled the market for much of the quarter. One of the biggest areas of activity was in the airline industry, where the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, was bid for by Marvin Davis, a California financier. UAL, which advanced 102.2 percent, was the third-largest gainer on the Big Board, ending the quarter at $282. The airline has agreed to a $6.7 billion buyout by members of management, employees, and British Airways. The deal is subject to approavl by Federal regulators. **********The activity in the stock of UAL and other airline companies, like NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, drove the Dow transportation average to record highs. The transportation average gained 49.51 percent in the quarter and was the center of attention for most of the last three months. Losses for Braniff **********One airline stock that posted heavy losses for the quarter was Braniff Inc., which was among the biggest losers on the over-the-counter market. Braniff filed for Chapter 11 protection at the end of September, after the company reported a severe cash shortage. **********Among the other takeover stocks that were big gainers were the Anchor Glass Container Corporation of Tampa, Fla., which advanced 68.1 percent to end the quarter at $19.125. That gain was the eighth-largest on the Big Board. The money-losing glassmaker received an offer of $20 a share, or $280 million, from Vitro S.A., a Mexican company. Although the Anchor board has resisted the tender offer, analysts have said they expect the company to accept it, helping to push up the stock price. **********Another big gainer was the Squibb Corporation of Princeton, N.J., which announced that it would merge with the Bristol-Myers Company. The deal, valued at about $12 billion, would create one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Squibb jumped 66.8 percent in the quarter, to close at $127. That was the 10th-largest percentage gain on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In addition to Lomas, several other financial services companies were among heavy Big Board losers.

Gorbachev wondered aloud, that a party having an army of well-indoctrinated regulars, having control of the press, ''having everything,'' has suddenly begun to lose the initiative? **********That was the question facing the top leaders of the Communist Party as they huddled on Tuesday at Central Committee headquarters, in this week of proliferating labor unrest and nationalist upheaval. **********The leaders' distress was transcribed in four pages of Friday's Pravda, giving Soviet readers a remarkable chance to eavesdrop on a party befuddled by its own decline. **********To Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the problem was the party's own inertia. Paralyzed by complacency and ''siege syndrome,'' Mr. Ryzhkov said, the Communists had been embarrassed in the elections and now faced a real danger of losing control. **********Mr. Gorbachev seemed to agree, and he declared that the solution was a ''renewal'' of the party elite - a purge of the out-of-touch regulars and an infusion of fresh blood. **********But others saw other causes of the party's misfortune - lapsed discipline, an irreverent press, the loosening of economic controls, or a conspiracy of unnamed ''forces.'' **********Here are excerpts from remarks at the meeting, in chronological order, as translated by The New York Times.  Lev N. Zaikov  Moscow Party Leader **********One cannot but see that certain forces play on the wave of perestroika, forces that do everything with the goal of discrediting the party and our entire state, consciously confusing the healthy part of the party with the decayed, the healthy state organs with the bureaucratic ones, healthy beginnings of the economy with those that must be replaced.  * **********Wherever you look, there is relentless propaganda of Western values. If the news, as they say, is ''from over there,'' then it is about luxury cars and villas, shop windows, etc. And our news? Perpetual shortages, law breaking, drug addiction. It is as if perestroika isn't changing anything, it is as if we have only black paint with which to color ourselves.  Nursultan A. Nazarbayev  Kazakh Party Leader **********Often our party and Government leaders are frightened by democratization, are prepared to see in it the main reason for the spreading social tension. The lack of public confidence felt by the party today is a result of our inability to listen to people, to fully investigate their needs and demands, and unwillingness to defend them from common hardships.  * **********We must begin to listen to the voice of the people, to acknowledge those representatives of informal groups who bravely take upon themselves the responsibilities of leadership. We should look on many of them as our reserve forces, trust them with responsible positions in the party, Government and economy.  Leonid F. Bobykin  Sverdlovsk Party Leader **********It is urgently necessary to rework the law on cooperatives (private entrepreneurs), which has led to speculation in most of the cooperatives, unchecked by legal barriers or economic limits imposed by the marketplace. It is time to stop labeling as conservatives and enemies of perestroika everyone who is worried about where the cooperative movement is going.  Yegor K. Ligachev  Politburo, Agriculture **********You know, in our speeches, of course, out of the best of intentions, promises were sometimes given that positive changes would come quickly. In particular it was said that the difficulties with the provision of the population with foodstuffs were planned to be eliminated within two years . . . but life has shown us otherwise. Many years are needed in order to transfer a gigantic country such as ours to a new qualitative level.  * **********Today in society an animated conversation is taking place about the state of the party, about how faith in it is diminishing, about how poorly social problems are being resolved. To this we must add the fact that in many regions of the country a situation has arisen in which people are afraid for their own safety, for the lives of their children and for the future of their country.  Nikolai I. Ryzhkov  Prime Minister **********So many accusations are being directed at the party both here and abroad that it is losing authority in the eyes of the people. This has engendered a feeling of bitterness among each of us, and, it must be admitted, a desire to justify all of this by past mistakes and the need for cleansing.  * **********Despite the loss of authority and of influence over all that is happening in society, unwittingly or not, we have continued to maintain the illusion that nothing special has happened, that as before the main levers remain in our hands and that using them, we can as before, with the very same methods, govern the complex processing evolving in the country.  * **********We must, in my view, admit that the appraisal made after the elections is not entirely accurate. We have overestimated the statistics when we say that 85 percent of the deputies elected are Communists. In fact this quantitative majority of party members says little. Many of them do not have a clear position on the main issue that arises repeatedly, that is, the attempts to disparage the leading role of the party in society and cast doubt on the fact that it is society's political nucleus.  * **********We were also unprepared for the congress and allowed ourselves to underestimate the activity of certain groups, including informal organizations. They literally burst their way to the podium with their own platforms, programs, proposals and accusations and often insinuations against the party. Meanwhile the Politburo stood to the side, in some kind of isolation, as if it had fallen under siege.  * **********The Congress and the Supreme Soviet sessions have shown that the structural changes that were made in the Central Committee are clearly insufficient. More cardinal changes are needed. We now need to find new approaches, new methods, new principles to govern relations among the triangle of power that has emerged today in our system of government -the Central Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers. . . . If the party does not find a way out of this then it may lose influence over state government.  Vadim A. Medvedev  Ideology Chief **********The mass media has become the vanguard in the process of renewal. They deserve most of the credit for removing obstacles of the past and developing democratization and glasnost. Freedom from dogmatic bindings and unjustified restriction on public thought. People see before their very eyes the return of a realistic, unadorned picture of our modern life and former history.  * **********It would be absurd, especially now as perestroika enters its most crucial stage, if we were to start restricting and curtailing glasnost. It is simply unacceptable for society and yes, even impossible, because the process of democratization has become irreversible. To go against it would mean to lose the trust of the people.  * **********The party cannot relinquish its political influence on the press. It is the most powerful weapon and whoever controls it is in command and controls the key positions in forming public opinion. We have to admit that party influence on the press has weakened.  Vitaly I. Vorotnikov  Russian Federation President **********The point is that perestroika is truly not going the way we want it to, and to put it even more directly, critical voices among the people, among both Communists and non-Communists are rising.  * **********Apparently the process of economic transformations and the economic reform have not yielded the expected results. This is despite the fact that the preparations for the reform were, frankly speaking, seemingly thorough. . . . To tell the truth, we allowed for the possibility of mistakes and flaws. We thought that the important thing was to spot and correct them. But the time has come to change the entire range of postulates.  Mikhail S. Gorbachev  President **********I would like to re-emphasize that there are no simple solutions and none are in sight. And there is no returning to the ''good old times,'' although some people still retain notes of nostalgia for them.  * **********The party cannot gain authority by decree. No mighty decree or decision can do this now. Our authority was acquired at the first stage of perestroika by having offered society the policy of perestroika. And society trusted the party, supported it and followed it. Today authority can be won only by the decisive and consistent carrying out of the policy of perestroika. There is not nor will there be any other way for the party to win authority. If someone thinks otherwise this is unrealistic, comrades.  * **********If perestroika is a revolution - and we agreed that it is - and if it means profound changes in attitudes toward property, the status of the individual, the basics of the political system and the spiritual realm, and if it is to transform the people into a force of change in society, then how can all of this take place quietly and smoothly? **********And do we really need to be overcome with panic when the revolutionary processes have become a reality? We have caused them by our policy. Can it be that we didn't understand this when we discussed it all?  * **********The restructuring processes that have unfurled today are enveloping all realms of our life. They are revealing much unusual and much that is sometimes hard to accept. This is generating additional tension. But that is what these revolutionary years are all about! We must understand all of this and act like a revolutionary party. Otherwise forces will appear which, seeing that the party is lagging behind, will try to seize the initiative. This is already happening.  * **********The ranks need renewal, an influx of fresh forces. And they need to be renewed at the level of the work collective, district, city, region, territory, republic, Central Committee and Politburo. This concerns everyone. Everywhere, at every level overdue staffing issues must be resolved in a timely fashion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/07/world/us-says-soldier-crippled-spy-post-set-up-in-berlin.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen With", "pub_date": "1989-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2037, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. SAYS SOLDIER CRIPPLED SPY POST SET UP IN BERLIN", "print_headline": "U.S. SAYS SOLDIER CRIPPLED SPY POST SET UP IN BERLIN", "body_text": " **********Investigators have concluded that James W. Hall 3d, an Army warrant officer court-martialed earlier this year for espionage, severely damaged several electronic eavesdropping operations aimed at Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Government officials say. **********The findings, based in part on Mr. Hall's cooperation with the authorities, confirm some of the worst fears about a case that officials said began with a tip from an East German official working as a spy for American intelligence. **********The officials said that one program rendered useless cost hundreds of millions of dollars and was designed to exploit a Soviet communications vulnerability uncovered in the late 1970's.  Enlisted by Mechanic **********According to the officials, the Hall inquiry has been significantly widened to include allegations that other American servicemen were enlisted as spies by the same man, an auto mechanic who is charged with ''running'' Mr. Hall's activities. **********The mechanic, Huseyin Yildirim, taught auto repair to Army personnel at the service's Field Station Berlin, the post from which Mr. Hall is believed to have done the most damage. Investigators are said to suspect that the other servicemen were part of a separate network that Mr. Yildirim organized before Mr. Hall volunteered to spy for East Germany in late 1982. **********The suspicion that a skilled recruiter of spies was plying his trade while on the payroll of Field Station Berlin worries Government officials, who called the base among the most important American listening posts in Europe. It is used to test the newest devices for capturing Eastern bloc communications, officials said. About 1,300 service personnel work at the base.  'Looking at Potential' **********''We are looking at the potential -and it's so far just potential - that this could be the Army's Walker case,'' said one official, referring to the devastating Soviet spy ring led by Warrant Officer John A. Walker Jr. of the Navy. **********Prosecution documents at Mr. Hall's court-martial maintained that he disclosed not only data on the eavesdropping systems but information about Western alliance plans in the event of a European war. Other sources say Mr. Hall delivered to the East Germans or Soviets NATO wartime scenarios into the 21st century. **********The 30-year-old Mr. Hall, who served in West Berlin from 1982 to 1985, was arrested last Dec. 20 after he boasted of six years of espionage to a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent posing as a Soviet intelligence officer. American officials expressed fears then that Mr. Hall had caused a major security breach. Mr. Hall pleaded guilty in February to espionage charges and is serving a 40-year prison term. Trial in Savannah **********Mr. Yildirim has pleaded not guilty and could be tried later this year in Federal court in Savannah, Ga. Peggy Bie, the woman with whom he has lived since 1985, said in an interview that Mr. Yildirim was an anti-Communist who had tried to stop Mr. Hall from spying. **********Ms. Bie insisted that he withheld damaging documents from his deliveries to the East Germans and buried them in West Germany. **********A Government official said that F.B.I. agents and Mr. Yildirim's lawyer, Lamar Walter, recently visited Germany with a map provided by Mr. Yildirim and, after some digging, did find caches of classified documents. But he said investigators continue to believe Mr. Yildirim was involved in espionage. **********Even if Mr. Yildirim did withhold the most damaging documents, Mr. Hall was dealing with the Soviets independently. Mr. Walter declined to comment.  Largely Secret Inquiry Interviews with Government officials and witnesses here and in Germany disclose these new aspects about an espionage inquiry, which has largely remained secret: *********** The case against Mr. Hall began with a tip from a Central Intelligence Agency source inside the East German Government. Officials said he had defected to the West and is in hiding. *********** Mr. Hall was paid as much as $300,000 over six years by the East German and Soviet intelligence services, making him one of the highest-paid Eastern bloc spies in recent memory. He acknowledged making 30 to 60 deliveries of secrets to East German and Soviet agents while stationed both in the United States and in West Germany. *********** Mr. Yildirim, the mechanic, befriended military intelligence officers in Berlin, including some whose jobs were to catch spies. One letter of recommendation for Mr. Yildirim, written by a senior American officer, praised him as a ''true master in his field'' who had ''worked quietly and for the most part unseen in making this a better place. Fragility of the System **********Administration officials said the Hall case illustrates the fragility of the multibillion-dollar electronic and satellite systems this country uses to gather its most precious intelligence. **********These systems are especially vulnerable to the new spies of the 1980's: low-paid technicians, like Mr. Hall, who who was an E-5 and E-6 enlisted man while in Berlin. His final salary as a warrant officer, including benefits, was $25,894. **********''Without commenting on the specifics, it appears that Hall did very serious damage,'' said Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. **********The damage caused by Mr. Hall, and possibly by Mr. Yildirim, has dismayed senior officials because it appears to fit a pattern of Soviet efforts to collect data on Western conventional forces.  THE SOLDIER'S STORY  Just One Worker Among Thousands **********Virtually nothing in Mr. Hall's background foreshadowed his career as a spy. His Sharon Springs, N.Y., high school yearbook shows a slim, blond young man with neatly kept shoulder-length hair. **********Mr. Hall joined the Army in September 1976, a year after high school, and spent his first four years at Fort Devens, Mass. before moving in 1981 to Field Station Berlin. **********Mr. Hall was among thousands of low-paid workers who run the most expensive machinery in the intelligence world. Spy novels may describe derring-do by suave operatives in Europe's dark corners, but the reality is that most of the money is spent on satellites and antennas. **********Telephone calls, satellite signals beamed to earth, military communications and cables and telex machines are targets for the Field Station. It sits atop the highest point in West Berlin, an earth-covered mound of World War II rubble called Teufelsberg, or Devil's Mountain, and its multisided antennas pick up signals throughout Eastern Europe and the western Soviet Union. It is an important post: most senior Army intelligence officials in Washington spent part of their careers there. Spying in 1982 Charged **********Government officials said Mr. Hall volunteered to spy for East Germany in late 1982. He told the F.B.I. that Mr. Yildirim delivered intelligence documents and returned with payments in dollars and German marks. Later, Mr. Hall dealt separately with Soviet intelligence officers, the Government officials said. **********One former senior intelligence official said he was skeptical about the harm one low-level Army soldier could cause from the listening post in West Berlin. This former official noted that no secret codes had been lost, and the damage, at worst was to American ability to read Soviet communications. **********But other officials insisted that programs associated with Mr. Hall that went dead in the 1980's were valuable. They said, for example, that Mr. Hall worked on one program for intercepting Soviet communications that depended on the Soviet Union's being unaware of a failing in its security procedures. **********Army colleagues say Mr. Hall was a capable soldier whose technical prowess and initiative marked him out as someone with a bright future. He rose steadily from his initial assignment as an analyst to the position of supervisor, or ''team chief,'' Army records show. Access to Range of Programs **********An Army officer said that the Field Station's approximately 1,300 servicemen are divided into companies, which are in turn made up of platoons, each of which has several teams or sections. The officer said Mr. Hall likely served on several teams and would have had access to different eavesdropping programs. **********Despite tight security, he could have obtained additional information through ordinary gossip with co-workers, by volunteering to work other soldiers' shifts, or by breaking into files he was not permitted to see, Army officers said. **********After leaving Berlin, Mr. Hall moved on to Frankfurt, where the Army maintains a base for processing material intercepted by Berlin and other stations. His activities there were so extensive, the F.B.I. has charged in court papers, that Mr. Yildirim bought him a photocopying machine for his apartment. **********Mr. Hall returned to the United States in May of 1987 for training as a warrant officer. Few Army enlisted men are selected for this promotion, which he earned in February of 1988 even as his espionage continued, court papers say. A Tip Received in 1988 **********American officials got wind of the case in late 1988, after a tip from its agent inside Germany. The C.I.A. provided the information to the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, which began an investigation that eventually also involved the F.B.I. **********On Dec. 20, Mr. Hall met an F.B.I. agent who was specially trained to imitate the style and accent of a Soviet intelligence operative. Mr. Hall was convinced, and within hours, he was under arrest.  THE MECHANIC'S STORY  An Immigrant Who Made Good **********When he worked as a mechanic at one of the Army's most sensitive electronic eavesdropping posts in Europe, Mr. Yildirim appeared to be the typical immigrant made good: an outgoing fellow who befriended everyone from enlisted men to the head of the Army's elite team of spycatchers. **********Mr. Yildirim, 58, was known as the ''Meister'' - the German word for master mechanic. **********Armando Parada, a former Army intelligence officer who served in Germany until 1985, said he had once lent Mr. Yildirim money to open a fruit stand. Recruitment of Agents **********Mr. Parada said his job involved the recruitment of agents from East Germany and other hostile powers. Mr. Yildirim was also friends with Mr. Parada, whose Arizona home is decorated with copper and brass artifacts brought by Mr. Yildirim from Istanbul. **********''If he was a courier when I was in Berlin, we goofed,'' said Mr. Parada. ''He didn't impress me that way. He just wasn't that smart.'' **********Mr. Parada recalled that on one occasion, Mr. Yildirim traveled to Africa, returning with raw diamonds that he later polished and said he sold for ''good money.'' No Security Check **********Federal investigators are said to be looking into the possibility that Mr. Yildirim was set up in the diamond business by the East Germans as payment for his activities. **********Mr. Parada said that because Mr. Yildirim was a ''local hire'' and had no access to classified information, no background check or security clearance was required. **********According to Ms. Bie, Mr. Yildirim came to Germany from Turkey in 1964 and went to work for Bosch, near Stuttgart. In 1979, he became a mechanic in an Army crafts shop at Field Station Berlin frequented by servicemen who liked to work on their cars. Lived With an American **********In this period Mr. Yildirim lived with an American woman named Ella Pettway Amir, who is said to have provided the authorities with an account of Mr. Yildirim's espionage activities.

Marcinkus of Cicero, Ill., is preparing to take up a new appointment at the Holy See after 20 years as president of the Institute for Religious Works, known as the Vatican Bank. **********Yet seven years after the $1.3 billion scandal, the still-murky role of the 67-year-old Archbishop in the collapse of the Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano continues to undermine confidence in the Vatican's financial affairs. **********And with the Ambrosiano case expected to go to trial this year, the Vatican is again bracing for fresh charges and possibly embarrassing revelations about its responsibility for Italy's biggest postwar financial scandal. **********The Vatican has always denied any wrongdoing by Archbishop Marcinkus or the bank, and has insisted that its payment of $240 million to Banco Ambrosiano creditors was a good-will gesture rather than an admission of guilt. **********But it has nonetheless failed to emerge fully from under the clouds of suspicion created by the scandal, with the Vatican's current record deficit -estimated at $78 million for 1989 - at least partly attributed to a drop in public contributions since 1982. Chairman Found Hanged **********At the time, the Vatican Bank owned 1.5 percent of the Banco Ambrosiano as well as many shell companies to which the bank had made huge loans. Archbishop Marcinkus was a close friend of the bank's chairman, Roberto Calvi, who was found hanged under a bridge in London in June 1982. **********A warrant was even issued later for the arrest of the Archbishop, forcing him to remain in the Holy See until the Italian Supreme Court ruled last year that as a Vatican employee, he had the same immunity from prosecution as officials of other governments. **********This month, the public prosecutor in the case, Pierluigi Dell'Osso, said he would have sought the Archibishop's indictment had he not been shielded. Among those indicted was Licio Gelli, the former head of a powerful secret Masonic lodge known as P-2. **********The document containing the indictment said the Vatican Bank shared responsibility for Ambrosiano's collapse. It said that without the bank's intervention, Mr. Calvi would have been arrested in the summer of 1981, a development that would have been less prejudicial to shareholders and creditors. **********The Vatican Bank's senior administrators, the indictment said, were always aware that they were giving Mr. Calvi the cover to carry out operations that he could not effect openly. **********The distress caused by the case in many Catholic circles has stemmed not only from the decision by Pope John Paul II to allow Archbishop Marcinkus to continue running the Institute for Religious Works, but also from the secrecy surrounding Vatican finances. Balance Sheets Are Secret **********''The institute never publishes its balance sheets,'' complained a Vatican official. ''When it paid out $240 million, was that half or three-quarters or what percentage of its capital?'' **********After the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, the Pope appointed a 15-member council of cardinals to study the Vatican's finances, and its formal accounts have been published since 1986, revealing a steadily growing operating deficit. But the cardinals have had no access to the balance sheets. ''The cardinals have repeatedly asked to see them, but Marcinkus was able to refuse because he enjoyed the confidence and trust of the Pope,'' the official said. **********The council of cardinals has argued that only greater openness can rebuild confidence in Vatican's finances. It was a tribute to their insistence that the Holy See announced last month that Archbishop Marcinkus would retire as the Vatican Bank's president and assume a still unannounced position. **********Even more significant, for the first time since its creation in 1929, the bank's general manager - who has still to be appointed - will be a layman.

Eagleburger, President Bush's choice to be Deputy Secretary of State, came under sharp questioning in his Senate confirmation hearing today about his relationship with two consulting firms headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. **********Senators from both parties asked Mr. Eagleburger to go beyond what is required by law and reveal all of the clients of the consulting firms, not just the accounts that he personally worked on as president of the firms. **********Mr. Eagleburger received $916,000 last year in salaries and bonuses from Kissinger Associates and an affiliated firm, Kent Associates, for his work for some of the largest multinational companies in the world. Today he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he could not provide the names of all the clients because of confidentiality agreements. Conflict of Interest Concern **********Mr. Eagleburger also said the agreements prevented him from discussing the substance of his dealings with his own clients. **********The concerns expressed today reflected questions among the senators about how Mr. Eagleburger can avoid conflicts of interest if he assumes the No. 2 post at the State Department. He has pledged to recuse himself for a year from any matters involving his former clients, but questions remain about how he can be seen to avoid potential conflicts if all the clients are not disclosed, at least to the committee. **********''We have to figure out some procedure,'' said Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, at the hearing. Mr. Simon, who favors disclosure of the names of the firms, added, ''Frankly, in your case, I know you well enough that I have confidence in you. But we shouldn't just be doing this on an ad hoc basis, because we happen to like Larry Eagleburger, we say, 'No, forget about who his clients have been.' '' **********As required by the Ethics in Government Act, Mr. Eagleburger reported on his financial disclosure statement the names of Kissinger clients he personally worked for and that generated more than $5,000 in fees in 1988. Threat to Job Is Not Seen **********By declining to further discuss his consulting work today, Mr. Eagleburger limited the ability of the committee to investigate his consulting activities in the four years since he retired from the Foreign Service. Despite the current political climate in Washington, in which even the appearance of a conflict of interest has put some key Bush appointees on the defensive, the problem is not regarded as serious enough to block Mr. Eagleburger's confirmation, according to committee members and their aides. **********Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser, also worked for Kissinger Associates. Although his appointment was not subject to Senate confirmation, similar questions have been raised about potential conflicts of interest. He, too, has said he would not become involved in decisions affecting companies he advised. **********Mr. Scowcroft, who reported that he worked as a consultant and did not have a list of Kissinger clients, said in a letter to C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, that Mr. Kissinger declined to provide a list of clients. **********''The contractual relationship between Kissinger and Kent and their clients is one of confidentiality, except when required by law,'' William D. Rogers, Mr. Eagleburger's attorney and a board member of Kissinger Associates, said in a telephone interview today. **********''The decision rests with both Kissinger and his clients. Henry also has a desire not to have his consulting relationship with a client a matter of public record because he doesn't want his name invoked on behalf of any particular client.'' **********Mr. Kissinger, in an interview Tuesday before leaving for Japan, said he would comply with the law but added, ''I violently object to this approach of being dragged through the mud'' and having information about clients made public. 'A Matter of Principle' **********In response to persistent questioning by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who asked whether Mr. Eagleburger was going to use the confidentiality agreement to refrain from answering questions, Mr. Eagleburger replied: ''I am informed and, I think, as a matter of principle, having been involved in the organization of Kissinger Asssociates, that I cannot go beyond a revelation of the names of those clients on which I worked and the general description I've given about what we did.'' **********But Mr. Eagleburger told Mr. Helms that he would ''think about'' his request to ask Mr. Kissinger for a release from the confidentiality agreements. **********Mr. Eagleburger also told the committee that he was selling his stocks and ending all business affiliations to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. ''There will be no conflicts because I will have no outside interests,'' he said. **********Mr. Eagleburger's disclosure of his relationship with the Kissinger companies and his promise to disqualify himself for one year from State Department matters involving his former clients conforms with current policies and laws. Mr. Eagleburger has also pledged to recuse himself for one year from matters involving any private organization on whose board he served. **********Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, questioned Mr. Eagleburger about whether he has considered recusing himself from issues involving any Kissinger clients because he was compensated financially from all the companies' profits. Mr. Eagleburger replied, ''No, Senator. The answer is no, I did not.'' 'Might Be a Lousy Idea' **********Mr. Rogers, who accompanied Mr. Eagleburger to the hearing, said after the hearing that such a move was under consideration, but added, ''It might be a lousy idea. It would take things much further.'' **********According to Mr. Eagleburger's disclosure statement, his work at the Kissinger firms included the following companies: Coca-Cola; Anheuser-Busch; the I. T. T. Corporation; H.J. Heinz; Union Carbide Corporation; Daewoo Corporation, the South Korean conglomerate; Fiat, the Italian manufacturing giant; L.M. Ericsson A.B. of Sweden; ASEA Brown Boveri of Sweden; Midland Bank of Britain; A.B. Volvo, the Swedish manufacturer; the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company of Belgium; the Global Motors Corporation, the Yugoslav manufacturer of the Yugo automobile, and Enerjoprojeckt, the Yugoslav-based engineering and construction company. **********Mr. Kissinger has said his company has about 30 clients. **********Mr. Eagleburger appeared most confident when answering questions about substantive foreign policy matters, and on certain issues he went beyond the recent public testimony of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. **********On Afghanistan, Mr. Eagleburger said the United States should formally sever relations with the Soviet-backed Afghan regime of President Najibullah, although it is premature to recognize the interim government established by the American-backed rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/business/company-news-rules-are-eased-in-ford-jaguar-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rules Are Eased In Ford Jaguar Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Rules Are Eased In Ford Jaguar Bid", "body_text": " **********The Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed certain takeover rules in the Ford Motor Company's $2.5 billion bid for the British luxury car maker Jaguar P.L.C.

But a closer examination of the Panama attack indicates that its large scale increased the number of civilian casualties and possibly forfeited the opportunity to seize Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.  The Panama operation also stirred concern in the United States military over the surprisingly high casualty rate among special operations forces, small clandestine units designed for commando-type operations. **********The high casualty rate is certain to figure prominently as the Pentagon reviews its strategy in the 1990's in the face of the diminished Soviet threat. Military planners have said special operations forces will probably play an enhanced role in so-called low-intensity conflicts. C.I.A. Agent Freed **********The small commando-like teams drawn from the Army and the Navy carried out a variety of missions in Panama, including the release of a Central Intelligence Agency agent from a local prison, the seizure of an airstrip and raids on sites where General Noriega was believed to be hiding. There were other missions that most of which the Pentagon will not discuss. **********But the special operations forces suffered 10 killed and 93 wounded, easily the highest rate of any of the conventional units in the 12,000-man force sent to do the fighting. The number of special operations personnel in the Panama attack is classified. **********The main part of the Panama attack was a virtual replay of a World War II battle, with paratroops dropping from the sky and tanks blasting through a city to overwhelm the opposition. By most accounts, the American military command underestimated the opposition they faced, and heavy casualties to a mainly friendly civilian population was a result. Noriega Was Alerted **********Panamanian resistance might have collapsed quickly and casualties might have been minimized if General Noriega had been captured by the special forces teams that had been searching for him for days before the attack. Special operations forces are designed for just such missions. **********But the preliminary movement of troops and equipment to Panama weeks before the attack and the impossibility of keeping the airlift secret were more than enough to alert General Noriega and the Panamanian Defense Forces, preventing the special operations teams from achieving surprise. 'Security Was Poor' **********''Operational security was poor, and there was no cover or deception plan,'' said Edward Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''This meant that they had to overwhelm the Panamanians.'' **********''The Army did what it knows how to do,'' he said. ''It went in with heavy firepower and troops trained for a large scale-war on the plains of Europe, not the expeditionary wars of the third world.'' **********Given the lack of secrecy, Pentagon officials said they were disappointed but not surprised that the Panamanian leader eluded them. But the officials pointed out that the plan to restore civil rule in Panama did not hinge on his capture but rather on the quick defeat of the Panamanian Defense Force. As it turned out, it was the Americans who were surprised when the Panamanians put up a stiff resistance. ''They thought that when we came in the front door, Noriega's troops would run out the back,'' said John Collins, an analyst at the Library of Congress. **********Even though organized resistance collapsed in the first hours of the attack, small pockets of Panamanians fought hard against the Americans and upset the timetable for the operation. **********Intelligence also failed in not crediting the General Noriega's Dignity Battalions with a combat capability. These units fought hard and denied the American forces control of Panama City even after the Panamanian Army had laid down its arms. **********What planners hoped would be an operation measured in hours stretched into days, and exhausted soldiers found themselves battling snipers while looters turned downtown Panama city into a shambles - a situation for which the Southern Command was unprepared even though they had a brigade of military policemen available. High Panamanian Casualties **********It is still too early to judge whether there was a less destructive way to depose the Panamanian strongman, but the Panamanians paid a stiff price for the way it was actually done. Incomplete casualty figures for the Panamanian Defense Force were put at 297 killed and 123 wounded, and the fighting resulted in about 400 killed and 2,000 wounded among civilians and members of the Dignity Battalions. and up to 13,000 people displaced, of whom about 5,000 are still without shelter. **********This is an embarrassment for the United States, which seeks to avoid ''collateral damage,'' as civilian casualties and property damage are euphemistically called in combat operations. A senior Pentagon official, disturbed by what he termed the ''bungling'' in the city, observed, ''As a model for future operations, it leaves something to be desired.'' **********Another flaw in planning was the apparent failure to anticipate fully that desperate pro-Noriega Panamanians might take Americans hostages. Although American troops were heavily engaged with pockets of organized resistance, elsewhere in the city places like the Marriott Hotel were known to have substantial numbers of Americans present and legitimate objectives for protective forces. **********When hostages were taken at the Marriott Hotel, field commanders had to be prodded from Washington to send troops to their assistance. Failure to Seize TV **********Another puzzling oversight was the failure to quickly seize Panama's radio and television broadcasting installations. In the last two months events in the Philippines provided ample evidence of the importance of radio and television during urban disorders, yet American troops allowed a pro-Noriega radio station to remain on the air, rallying loyalists for a full day. **********Despite the unexpected problems encountered in the fight for Panama City, Pentagon officials consider the operation a major success, and most military experts agree. **********Other than some instances of paratroopers being dropped at the wrong location, the operation went smoothly and the huge airlift and nearly simultaneous night parachute assault on four different targets was a masterpiece of timing and coordination. **********The Army has smarted for six years under the criticism it received in the Grenada invasion of 1983 for poor communications and a failure to fight aggressively. Army officials insisted that the confusion that marked the service's performance in Grenada was not evident in any way in Panama. Different From Grenada **********Although the Panama operation will be invariably compared to Grenada, it is misleading to make many comparisons. The Grenada invasion was planned on such short notice that it came as a surprise even to those who took part in it. **********On the other hand, the plan to intervene in Panama was completed well ahead of time, beginning in October after an attempt by disaffected Panamanian officers to oust Manuel Noriega failed. **********''Although a very well-run operation, it was more like a stateside maneuver with live ammunition than an invasion,'' said Loren B. Thompson of Georgetown University's National Security Program. ''We had all the advantages, but I doubt such complex a operation would work in a more remote area without in-place support.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/17/world/israel-sets-demands-on-taba.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Sets Demands on Taba", "print_headline": "Israel Sets Demands on Taba", "body_text": " **********Israel's inner Cabinet agreed today to demand free access for Israelis to the Taba Red Sea resort and joint ownership of a hotel complex there in exchange for returning the disputed area to Egypt, Cabinet officials said.

Part of Sudden Surge **********The East Germans were part of a sudden surge who flocked into West German missions in East Berlin, Prague and Budapest over the summer demanding to settle in West Germany. They evidently acted after vacationing East Germans began fleeing to West Germany by way of the Hungarian-Austrian border, from which the Hungarians began stripping barbed wire and detection devices last spring. **********About 6,000 East Germans have made it across the border, and despite efforts by Hungary to tighten border patrols, the illegal nighttime crossings have continued at a reduced rate.

These regimes jailed dissidents, disdained truth and scorned justice. Through long, dark decades, they seemed immutable, but they all began to founder in a matter of months. **********The bloody and still-incomplete revolution in Rumania, the opening of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate and the invasion of Panama, all within the final 10 days of 1989, provided a fitting denouement to a turbulent, dramatic, fascinating year in international affairs. Many called it ''the year of democracy'' - the most important 12 months, perhaps, since 1968, with all its rebellions, and worthy of comparison even with the annus mirabilis of 1848. **********But like 1848, it leaves behind many problems, many questions and many signs of instability, especially in the main cockpit of change, the area between the Elbe and the Urals. **********The tides of change are lapping dangerously now at the Soviet Union itself. Having encouraged or at least acquiesced in the establishment of multi-party systems and free elections in such one-time vassal states as Poland and East Germany and having hailed the plight of Mr. Ceausescu, can Mikhail S. Gorbachev long deny the same things to Lithuania, where the Communist Party has already broken with Moscow, or to restless Armenia, or to Moldavia, a troubled Soviet republic ethnically identical to the Moldavian region of Rumania?

''Can we move quickly enough to prevent this year of euphoria from being followed by a year of failure and frustration?'' **********The tests will be severe. True as it is that Western values have prevailed, true as it is that the uprising in Rumania demonstrates once again how contagious the virus of freedom can be, the new governments now being formed face huge political and economic problems. And they face them with leaders whose careers have been spent as civil-rights leaders, intellectuals, writers and lawyers, not as politicians. **********Even with the Marshall Plan, even with leaders as skilled as Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard, it took West Germany 10 years to achieve a convertible currency. By the same token, Marxism will not become Thatcherism overnight in East Germany or Czechslovakia. **********The swiftness of events in Rumania - even faster than in Czechslovakia -was what was so stunning. One day the regime looked resolute, impregnable. Then suddenly, ''the coming unrest spread its thunderclouds under the eyes of the government.'' as Victor Hugo wrote of the French revolution in ''Les Miserables.'' Building Is More Difficult **********But it is far easier to topple tired and rotten political and economic structures, as revolutionaries have discovered time and again over the centruies, than it is to build shiny, efficient, lasting new ones. **********And building new ones will cause distress to the millions in Eastern Europe who want democracy but also want to keep at least part of their socialist safety net intact. Inevitably, as they lose their guaranteed employment when obsolete factories are closed, as they lose food and rent subsidies, severe tensions will develop. People may become disillusioned with the new way. **********But even in economic disarray, East Germany, Czechosolovakia and Hungary together have a gross national product larger than China's.

Which Way a New Germany?  German unification - or consolidation or amalgamation - seems inevitable to many scholars and diplomats, either in fact or in law. But what will the terms be? Which way will the new Germany look and think and feel? Can it find ways to avoid frightening, elephant-like, the smaller animals in its forest? **********Then there are the ancient enmities between the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, camouflaged in Communist gray these many years and now emerging. Will border skirmishes break out once again, or will cooler heads finally prevail? **********On an even broader scale, politicians and philosophers are starting to ask, will the developed world find ways now to divert the money and the energy that have for 40 years sustained the cold war into helping the third world, safeguarding the environment, rebuilding its own shaky infrastructure? **********Such questions and their qualified, partial, contradictory answers, so slow to emerge, are less stirring than revolutions, and hence less likely to command the world's continuing interest and help.

The statute was developed to fight organized crime, but more recently it has been used against business executives and financiers. Payment to Official Alleged According to the indictment, the advertising agency executives conspired to kick back a portion of the agency's commission, totaling $900,000 over five years, to a Jamaican advertising executive, who then made payments, with the agency's knowledge, to Anthony Abrahams, Jamaica's Minister of Tourism from 1981 to 1984. **********Named in the indictment were Mr. Abrahams and Arnold Foote Jr., the president of Advertising and Marketing Jamaica Ltd., who the grand jury said acted as the go-between in the transactions. The American advertising figures named were Arthur R. Klein, 52 years old, who is the president and chief executive of Y.&R.'s New York office, and Thomas Spangenberg, 47, a former senior vice president at the agency. **********In addition, Steven M. McKenna, 40, the chief financial officer of Wunderman Worldwide, a Y.&R. subsidiary, was charged with perjury in connection with his statements to the grand jury. Agency Denies Charges **********Young & Rubicam denied the charges. ''They have a circumstantial case, and they turn what we believe to be legitimate payments to a legitimate businessman into kickbacks by claiming that businessman was a public official,'' R. John Cooper, the agency's executive vice president and general counsel, said. **********The indictment charges that Mr. Foote was a foreign official under the terms of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The act defines a foreign official as anyone acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of a foreign government. **********The agency, Mr. Abrahams, Mr. Foote, Mr. Klein and Mr. Spangenberg were each charged with one count of violating the RICO Act. Mr. Klein, Mr. Spangenberg and Y.&R. were also each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids Americans to bribe foreign officials. **********If convicted, Mr. Klein and Mr. Spangenberg would face up to 25 years in jail and $500,000 in fines. Mr Abrahams and Mr. Foote each would face up to 20 years in jail and $250,000 in fines. Mr. McKenna would face up to 5 years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Young & Rubicam could be fined up to $1 million. The Federal Government is also seeking $3.75 million, which it said was the agency's gross profit from the tourism account. 'Come Back To Jamaica' **********Young & Rubicam created the ''Come Back to Jamaica'' campaign for the island in April 1981. It continues to handle the account, which bills between $6 million and $10 million annually. **********The United States Attorney in New Haven, Stanley A. Twardy Jr., recounted a complex web of activities, including the change from a leftist to a conservative island Government, the establishment of a fake agency through which payments were funneled, and the involvement of the author Robert L. (Robin) Moore, who wrote ''The Green Berets.'' Mr. Moore was not named in yesterday's indictment. **********The indictment said the scheme started after Edward P. G. Seaga, a right-of-center politician, became Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1980, after the defeat of the left-of-center incumbent, Michael N. Manley. **********Mr. Abrahams, who became Minister of Tourism in the Seaga Government, is said to have summoned an executive of Intermarco Advertising, the American agency that then handled the island's tourism account, and suggested that kickbacks might be requested, the indictment said. **********Thereafter, according to the indictment, the account was placed under review, and Mr. Abrahams asked Mr. Foote, the Jamaican advertising executive, to help find an American agency to create advertising for Jamaica. **********Y.&R., Mr. Foote and Mr. Twardy, the United States Attorney, agree that Mr. Moore helped connect Mr. Foote with Y.&R. The author had spent much of his youth in Jamaica and was friendly with Government officials. It was his indictment for tax fraud in 1986, to which he pleaded guilty, that led the United States Government to begin investigating Y.&R. Mr. Moore's diaries, obtained by the Government in that case, discussed his work bringing the agency together with the Jamaican Government. **********The defendants, prosecutor and witnesses before the grand jury differ on what happened next. For example, Ramon G. Gaulke, the former head of Intermarco who testified before the grand jury, said in an interview yesterday that he ''had no knowledge of'' any unusual financial requests. He said the 1981 advertising review involving Intermarco, Benton & Bowles and Y.&R. was ''a fair competition.'' **********But, the indictment said, Y.&R., through Mr. Klein and Mr. Spangenberg, agreed to pay kickbacks to Mr. Abrahams through Mr. Foote, to influence the Jamaica Tourist Board to hire the agency. New Agency Set Up **********The indictment says the defendants hid the plan by funneling the money through an ad agency set up by Mr. Foote in the Cayman Islands, known as Ad Ventures. **********But Mr. Cooper of Y.&R. said the agency did not pay Mr. Foote until after it had received the account from the Jamaica Tourist Board. Thereafter, from 1981 to 1985, the agency paid Mr. Foote one-third of its 15 percent commission on media billings from the tourist board, which came to an average of $180,000 annually. **********Y.&R. terminated the contract with Mr. Foote because by 1985 ''we were sufficiently knowledgeable about how to operate in Jamaica that we didn't need his services any more,'' Mr. Cooper said, adding that the payments were made through Ad Ventures at Mr. Foote's request. **********Mr. Cooper said the agency knew Mr. Foote ''was part of in-crowd in the conservative Jamaican political group,'' but that it had no knowledge that Mr. Foote ever gave money to Mr. Abrahams in conjunction with the advertising account. **********Mr. Twardy said that Mr. Foote's ''sole purpose'' was ''obtaining and retaining the contract for Y.&R., in return for the kickback of commissions.'' **********But Mr. Foote, in a telephone conversation from his home in Jamaica, said that he was engaged as a creative consultant by Y.&R. He claimed credit for inventing the ''Make It Jamaica - Again'' slogan that was part of the agency's campaign for the island."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/business/business-technology-insurers-vs-doctors-a-software-battleground.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1989-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insurers vs. Doctors: A Software Battleground", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Insurers vs. Doctors: A Software Battleground", "body_text": " **********New computer software products using techniques developed by artificial intelligence researchers are helping a growing number of employers and insurers to audit some of the 1.5 billion doctor and hospital bills submitted each year for insurance payment. **********Some software products detect bills that charge separately for procedures that are ordinarily included in an overall, lower fee. Other programs call attention to unusually high or frequent charges. And some even help an insurer decide whether a patient needs surgery, whether for bunions, cataracts or a coronary artery bypass. In each case, the software only makes recommendations, leaving to the insurer the final decision on whether to deny payment. **********While these products are new, the technology for this kind of work is not. ''The principle is very much like auditing tax returns,'' said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a software newsletter. ''Certain things raise red flags.'' **********But at the same time, a small industry has sprung up to produce newsletters, seminars and products to help doctors and hospitals increase their revenues, as well as to improve efficiency.

The ''increase from correct coding,'' it says, is $112,800 a year for a physician who performs 10 such procedures a week. **********Some doctors justify such tactics by arguing that insurers have no right to interfere with a physician's paramount duty to care for the patient. **********The software products, which are called medical expert systems, are typically created by small, relatively new companies like Artificial Intelligence for Medicine, a two-year-old software company in Farmington, Conn.; GMIS, which is based in Malvern, Pa., and Health Payment Review Inc. in Boston. They license or lease claims-auditing systems to insurers, employers and H.M.O.'s. **********Electronic Data Systems, a unit of the General Motors Corporation that is the largest claims processor, has incorporated into its own system the software of four or five small companies that have niche products, said Bob Waid, president of the health and benefits division at E.D.S., which is based in Plano, Tex. **********E.D.S., which processed 375 million health-care claims last year, is adding GMIS's claims-auditing to its systems. Thomas R. Owens, executive vice president of GMIS, a company backed by Aetna, Metropolitan Life Insurance, First Boston, SmithKline Beecham and others, said more than 50 physicians in 26 medical specialties had contributed to the GMIS knowledge base. **********On the other side, ''there are 1,300 businesses trying to peddle software to physicians,'' said Joe Santoro, national accounts manager for the physician services division at the SMS Corporation in Malvern, Pa. The larger companies include SMS, the IDX Corporation in Boston and Cycare in Phoenix. **********SMS software lowers the number of rejected claims by eliminating items not covered by Blue Shield, for example. Mr. Santoro said SMS, like other software companies, has ''a consulting service - we offer them the methods to get maximum reimbursement, while staying within the confines of federally mandated restrictions.'' **********But claims auditors at H.M.O.'s and insurers watch for patterns they call ''creative billing.'' ''Creative billing has been a very big problem for a long time in podiatry,'' said Dr. Leslie Levy, president of Artificial Intelligence for Medicine. ''It has become an important problem in physician billing in the last two to four years.'' **********Dr. Levy added: ''The vast majority of physicians are not engaging in these practices, but the financial impact of a small percentage of doctors is tremendous.'' At Metropolitan Life, only 5 percent of all physicians who submit claims for outpatient care account for 75 percent of the rejected claims. **********The expert systems work by referring to a knowledge base of data and insights collected by physician advisers. The information is organized in logical sequences, using rules. **********''The engineer listens to the physician and decides how to structure the knowledge base so it mimics the physician's decision,'' said Don Holloway, vice president for product development at Health Payment Review. **********''The computer receives the claim in a five-digit code and looks for related rules like: If Code A and Code B show together, make the combination Code C,'' he said. ''For example, if the claim includes an appendectomy, our software looks into the rules and sees if the appendectomy is incidental to other surgery. Some employers pay for incidental procedures, but most don't.'' **********Computer experts said the knowledge base might be structured like a tree with branches. If the claim is rejected on an entry-level branch, it is shunted to other branches and more detailed questions are raised. If the process does not lead to an approval of the payment, the claimant is informed, usually by a registered nurse or physician, and may make an appeal with more information. **********''We need to keep a human being in the decision-making loop,'' Dr. Levy said. He warned that insurers might be hit by lawsuits accusing them of unfairly denying payments in the event of injury attributed to the denial. **********Mr. Waid said E.D.S. was now trying a product developed by Health Data Institute, a unit of Baxter International based in Lexington, Mass., which passes on whether a patient should be treated in a hospital and for how long. The software guides ''utilization review'' nurses in telephone conversations with prospective patients whose health plan requires prior approval. **********Taking the technology a step further, a system developed by Value Health Sciences Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif., makes recommendations on the medical necessity of 35 surgical procedures. **********The software helps a nurse reply in a few minutes to telephone requests for authorization of surgery, said Jacqueline Kosecoff, Value Health's executive vice president. For a hysterectomy, there are 1,800 clinical scenarios, each with five or six variables. **********She compared the technology to ''a huge graph: the 'down' column would include variables like maximal, submaximal or no therapy.'' ''The 'across' column,'' she said, ''would include clinical scenarios.'' For example, she said, surgery might not be appropriate for a patient with a three-month history of angina who had equivocal results in treadmill tests and was not receiving the maximum benefits from drug therapy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/business/personal-finance-picking-a-place-to-move-for-retirement.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1989-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Picking a Place to Move for Retirement", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; Picking a Place to Move for Retirement", "body_text": " **********Many people intend to move when they retire, looking for a more attractive life style, perhaps, or to be closer to family. **********Whatever the reason, choosing a new place to live can be a daunting task, particularly if it is in a distant state. Additional complications exist for those who want to spend their time in two states, shuttling back and forth between a retirement home and their old place. These retirees must decide which of the two states will be their principal residence and then arrange their affairs accordingly. The decision is crucial since it can affect everything from qualifying for property tax breaks to determining the amount, if any, of estate taxes that will be owed. **********Here then are some suggestions to aid in the search for a retirement home. **********Perhaps most important, give yourself plenty of time to make the choice. ''Don't wait until the last minute,'' said Steven B. Enright, director of financial planning for Seidman Financial Services in New York. ''The time to start looking, evaluating and comparing is years before you retire.'' **********Measure a prospective location using six criteria of equal weight, Mr. Enright said. These are climate and environment, the cost of living, price and availability of housing, quality of medical services, variety of recreational and cultural activities and special services for senior citizens. **********While you can evaluate potential retirement communities by vacationing there, do not select a location on the basis of one visit. Instead, make several trips, preferably during different times of the year. During the visits, seek out retirees and ask them what they like and dislike about the area. Also, subscribe to the local newspaper. **********Although taxes generally are not the overriding factor in selecting a retirement state, ''it's smart to know from a budgeting point of view what state taxes you're walking into,'' said Philip L. Kevitsky, national director of the state and local tax practice for Arthur Young & Company in New York. **********Florida and Nevada have no state income tax, for example, while the California state tax is among the highest in the nation. But watch out for hidden taxes. For instance, retirees who have large investment portfolios to cover living expenses should be aware that Florida and several other states have an ''intangibles'' tax, an annual levy on the fair market value of stocks and bonds. **********Because property taxes often make up a large chunk of the yearly tax bill, retirees are well advised to seek areas where property tax increases are growing at a slower rate. Many states sidestep the problem with a variety of tax breaks for older residents, usually those 62 and up. **********Eighteen states, for example, offer deferral programs that let older homeowners put off payment of their property taxes until they sell the property or die. While interest is charged on the back taxes, the rate is relatively low, typically around 6 percent, said Katrinka S. Sloan, a housing specialist with the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington. Even more states, including Florida and Arizona, offer credits or so-called homestead exemptions that reduce property taxes outright. And residents in some states can get either a tax deferral or a credit, depending on the amount of their income and assets. **********There are other tax differences among the states. Some states exempt Social Security payments from state income tax. Many exempt state or Federal public pensions from their income tax; some exempt private pension payments as well. Others offer income tax credits for the elderly. **********Where taxes are paid is clear enough when a retiree simply pulls up stakes in one area and moves permanently to another. But things are not always so clear when people keep one place in Florida, say, for the winter and another in New York for the rest of the year. **********Typically, a person is considered a resident of a state for income tax purposes if the person spends more than half of the year there. **********But many other taxes and rules are triggered only if the person is considered to be domiciled in the state, a term that is roughly equivalent to maintaining a principal residence there. **********Indeed, no matter how many residences you own, you can only have one domicile at a time. Choosing a domicile that creates the lowest overall tax bill is a complicated, but important, decision. To figure the total bill, you must look at the state's property, gift and estate taxes as well as its income taxes, said William G. Brennan, a partner with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney in Washington. Moreover, the concept of domicile goes far beyond tax issues. Domicile dictates which state's property law applies, and that can have a significant effect on how property is divided among heirs. For instance, states have different rules governing the division of property when there is no will. **********Traditionally, the critical element in determining domicile is maintaining a physical presence in a state with the intent of making that state your ''true home.'' The concept is murky enough so that living in a state for more than half of the year may not be enough to show such an intent. **********Therefore, you should develop as many contacts as possible with the state you have chosen as your new domicile, Mr. Brennan said. Register to vote there, for example, and file all state and local tax returns required by the new state. **********In addition, you should change the title and registration of automobiles and obtain a driver's license in the new state. Some states, like Florida, authorize the use of a special form of affidavit by which you can declare domicile. **********Be aware that if you change domiciles, you should check with an attorney in the new state to see whether your will and other legal documents need modification to conform with - or to take advantage of -that state's laws. **********And also be aware that many states, including Florida and New York, have agreed recently to cross-check tax information. The agreements are a reaction to abuses committed by some of those who divide their time between two states. These people have been sidestepping taxes in each place by claiming legal residence in the other. **********For a free pamphlet, ''State Tax Information for Relocation Decisions,'' write A.A.R.P.

No such cutback has happened yet, and now economists are revising their expectations. In fact, two new studies suggest that the consumer could, in theory, help prop up the economy. **********To be sure, Government data show the economy is weakening. Consumers have cut back on spending recently, not because they lacked the borrowing power to buy on credit, but because of ''apprehension'' about the economy's future, according to surveys of consumer sentiment. **********''People see sluggish economic growth on the horizon and they are being more cautious about their spending,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. **********The new studies on borrowing power focus on the upheaval that in recent years has changed the structure of personal debt. The total debt held by individuals and households is $3.4 trillion today, higher than ever. But the repayment period has been so stretched out that a borrower's monthly installments barely rise with each new loan and use up a relatively small percentage of disposable income. What is more, Federal Reserve Board data show that most of the new consumer installment loans in the 1980's have gone to the nation's wealthiest households, and they have the income to handle repayment. 'The Consumer Is in Good Shape' **********''The relentless story you keep hearing is that the consumer is tapped out; he can't borrow more and he is about to retrench,'' said James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, and the author of one of the new studies. ''But the debt service numbers tell a different story. They are remarkably stable, and they say the consumer is in good shape as a borrower.'' **********Many factors have led to the debt-stretching, which means, in effect, that a $240 loan over 10 years requires the same $2 a month to repay as a $120 loan over five years. **********Car loans, for example, now average 4.5 years, up from three years in the early 1980's. Many fixed-rate mortgages are for 30 years today instead of the 25 years common a decade ago. And mortgages taken out at interest rates above 15 percent have been refinanced with rates at 13 percent or less. The lower rates reduce monthly payments. **********Home equity loans, nonexistent until the mid-1980's, have become a major tool for stretching out debt. These loans, with payments stretched over 10 to 15 years, are often used to pay off loans with much shorter maturities, like credit card debt and revolving bank credit, which require repayment in monthly installments over only three years. Another reason for their growing use is that the interest paid on them is still fully deductible from taxable income. **********Home equity loans are now held by about 5.5 percent of all homeowners, up from nearly zero in the early 1980's. The loans average $13,000, with most maturing in 10 to 15 years, according to the American Financial Association, a trade group. Credit Cards Stretch Debt **********Even credit cards have been used to stretch debt. Instead of presenting department store charge cards, which usually require repayment in one year, shoppers now often use a Visa or Mastercard, for which a three-year payoff is allowed. **********''The result is that the ratio of payments to income has even declined since 1985,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Debt repayment consumed 17.9 percent of Americans' disposable income in 1985 - the decade's high - and has declined since to about 16.7 percent now, he said. **********But a major reason consumers can take on still more debt with equanimity is that 45 percent of the more than $750 billion in outstanding consumer credit is in the hands of the wealthiest 20 percent of the nation's households, said Thomas A. Durkin, a Federal Reserve Board economist, in a recent analysis. That is up from 21.7 percent in 1970 and 36.5 percent in 1977. Poorest's Borrowing Unchanged **********In contrast, the poorest households, at the bottom 40 percent of income, account for 19 percent of borrowing, unchanged since the early 1970's. **********''My guess is that the same trend holds true not only for consumer credit, but for total household debt, although the Federal Reserve has not run the numbers on this,'' Mr. Durkin said. The total debt of $3.4 trillion held by Americans includes mortgages, home equity loans, brokerage house loans, mobile home loans and the various forms of consumer credit. **********Why are the wealthy such big borrowers? During the high inflation of the late 1970's, wealthy households realized the advantages of repaying debt in dollars whose value was being eroded by inflation, Mr. Durkin said. And interest payments were fully deductible then. In addition, as the American economy expanded in the 1980's, the wealthy stepped up purchases of appliances, computers, cars and other expensive durable goods normally bought on credit, he said. **********At the same time, the wealthiest households are also the nation's biggest savers, and with deregulation of bank interest rates, the earnings on their savings deposits have risen. ''Since you can get a good return on savings today, the wealthy borrow temporarily rather than draw down their savings,'' said William Dunkelberg, a Temple University economist. **********Using Federal Reserve data, Mr. McKelvey calculates that total household debt is roughly equal to 90.4 percent of people's annual disposable income, down just a bit from the record of 91.1 percent in last year's fourth quarter. But while the total debt-to-income ratio has risen from 88.4 percent in 1986, installment payments as a percentage of income have fallen in the same period, to the 16.7 percent today, Mr. McKelvey said. That is only half the repayment level that lenders say households could handle without getting in over their heads. 'Not Being Pinched' **********''People are certainly not being pinched,'' Mr. McKelvey said. **********But even if Americans can afford more debt, they might retrench anyway - for psychological reasons, said Mr. Curtin, Michigan's director of consumer surveys. Among their concerns, he said, is fear that a weakening economy might push up unemployment and endanger their income. **********Indeed, consumers have pulled back on spending, a trend that showed up last week in the Commerce Department's retail sales report for October. Consequently, consumer credit is growing more slowly now than in the spring and summer, although this slowdown in growth has been largely offset by a rise in home equity lending. **********Michigan's monthly surveys also show that rising interest rates earlier this year discouraged consumers, since such increases frequently precede an economic slowdown, Mr. Curtin said, adding that interest rates are now falling again, but that consumers remain skeptical. ''They see the country just muddling along,'' he said, ''and that can slow their spending and their borrowing even if they have the wherewithal to take out new loans.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Ezra Helfand has been appointed senior vice president of DDB Needham Worldwide, New York. *********** John E.

Gorbachev has decided to go to Lithuania soon to consult with rank-and-file Communist Party members about the Lithuanian party's decision to break from Moscow, several people who attended an emergency party meeting here said today. The two-day meeting of the national party leadership ended without agreement on how to address the problem. **********Party leaders supported Mr. Gorbachev's denunciation of the Lithuanian party's defiance, but they were thwarted in trying to arrive at a specific response. **********Mr. Gorbachev told the Central Committee that the Lithuanian party's decision was ''illegitimate,'' and he further ruled out the secession of any republic from the Soviet Union - a right that is guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution and that was raised by the Lithuanian party leadership as a possible goal. Line Not to Be Crossed **********''The current party and state leadership will not permit the breakup of the federal state,'' Mr. Gorbachev told the Central Committee on Sunday, in remarks published today in the national press. ''If we cross this line, we will deliberately be heading toward the disintegration of the Soviet Union.''  [ Excerpts, page A12. ]  Mr. Gorbachev and the party leadership have been in a quandary over ways to deal with the Lithuanian party's decision to form an independent Communist Party. While tolerating and supporting the decisions in Eastern European countries to allow multiparty systems, Mr. Gorbachev has firmly resisted similar moves at home and any efforts to dilute the power of the central Communist Party. **********What leeway Mr. Gorbachev has given some of the restive republics, including Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, has been granted against the objections of conservative party members who argue that the discipline and prestige of the party are suffering because of such concessions. Defying the Kremlin **********Party and Government leaders in Lithuania have consistently defied warnings from the Kremlin - and personal appeals by Mr. Gorbachev - to curb nationalist and separatist actions in their republic. Earlier this month, the Lithuanian Parliament voted to abolish the Communist Party's constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power, angering Kremlin officials who had supressed similar proposals on the national level. **********At a news conference tonight, Vadim A. Medvedev, the Communist Party's ideology chief, refused to rule out the use of force in dealing with the independent-minded republics, but he said the Kremlin favored a political solution for dealing with internal problems. **********In his speech at the Central Committee meeting, Mr. Gorbachev described the extremes of the views on dealing with the rebellious Lithuanian party organization. **********On one side, Mr. Gorbachev said, were Central Committee members who felt the Lithuanian decision should be recognized as a fait accompli, and that the national party should limit its reaction to a ''political assessment.'' These members said ''the logic of the democratization of the Soviet federation'' would eventually lead to similar steps in other republics. **********But other members argued for harsh positions, Mr. Gorbachev said, ''believing that the integrity of the party and the state is at stake,'' and that ''their preservation justifies any means.'' Their proposal was to disband the Lithuanian party organization and to have the central authorities reconstitute it. **********Mr. Medvedev said at the news conference that some speakers at the session today called for the expulsion of the Lithuanian Communist Party leaders. **********Several people who attended the Central Committee meeting said Mikhail A. Ulyanov, an actor and a member of the party's central auditing commission, mediated between the two extremes by suggesting that a delegation of national party leaders visit the republic to assess the mood among Lithuanian Communist Party members. **********Mr. Gorbachev, they said, quickly threw his support behind the idea. 'No Brilliant Solution' **********''It was clear going into this meeting that there was no brilliant solution,'' said one central committee member who asked not to be named. ''But Ulyanov's suggestion was perfect because it pushed off the ultimate decision and will give everyone time to cool down and evaluate the situation more realistically and soberly. Gorbachev seemed almost relieved to have this idea presented to him.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev and the party leaders seemed particularly disturbed by the Lithuanian Communist Party's announcement that all current party members would automatically become members of the new party unless they turned in their old party cards. **********''Only each member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, each by himself, has the right to decide for himself the question of which party to join,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''No forum is entitled to mechanically transfer him from one party to another.'' **********Mr. Ulyanov's proposal to survey Lithuanian party members seemed to address the concern that the Lithuanian Party's decision was being made over the heads of the members. The Central Committee meeting is to resume after the leaders' trip to Lithuania. 'A Very Useful Trip' **********''I think it will a very useful trip for Gorbachev because hard-liners who are with him will be unable to deny that this decision is supported by the vast majority of Lithuanian Communists,'' said one person who attended the Central Committee meeting. ''It will prove to these people what Gorbachev has been saying to the party apparatus for a long time, that the party has some serious internal restructuring to do if it's going to keep up with society's demands.'' **********But Mr. Gorbachev's complaints were hardly reserved for the Communist Party leadership. He charged that Sajudis, the non-Communist political organization that is the most popular in Lithuania and advocates secession from the Soviet Union, is manipulating popular opinion in the republic toward separatism. **********Sajudis, Mr. Gorabchev said, took advantage of ''the turbulent processes'' taking place in the country to ''win popularity by fanning nationalistic sentiments.'' **********The Lithuanian Communist Party leadership, the Soviet leader said, was to blame for giving in increasingly to ''appeasement and endless concessions to even harsher demands from Sajudis.'' Pleased by the Outcome **********Lithuanian Communist Party leaders said tonight that they were pleased by the outcome of the Central Committee meetings because despite the denunciation of their party's decision, the national party leaders put off any real action. **********They also said that after the Central Committee meeting, Mr. Gorbachev telephoned Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party chief who presided over the decision to secede from the national party and who was chosen as the new party's leader. In a conversation described as cordial and pleasant, Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Brazauskas, ''I shake your hand,'' and said he looked forward to meeting in Lithuania. **********''It is the optimal response we could have hoped for,'' said Romualdas Ozolas, a member of the independent Lithuanian Communist Party's Politburo and a leader of Sajudis. ''Speaking strongly really doesn't amount to anything and we are set in our convictions. We will not retreat.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/15/world/sudan-agrees-to-discuss-emergency-famine-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sudan Agrees to Discuss Emergency Famine Aid", "print_headline": "Sudan Agrees to Discuss Emergency Famine Aid", "body_text": " **********The Sudanese Government has invited representatives of United Nations relief agencies and other humanitarian organizations to Khartoum next month to discuss emergency steps to avert mass famine this spring, officials say. **********The Khartoum Government has been under growing international pressure to do more to help four million refugees displaced by civil war, drought and other calamities. **********Relief organizations say hundreds of thousands of people face starvation in the spring unless food can be delivered to them in the weeks before the rainy season starts in May. Large areas of the country are cut off, the agencies say. **********The Sudan issued the invitation after the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, appealed personally to the Sudanese Prime Minister, Sadiq al-Mahdi. The invitation also followed renewed demands by many Western governments that the Sudanese leader cooperate more closely with relief groups trying to help the homeless and the starving. **********Last week Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d highlighted the growing refugee crisis in the Sudan when he made a similar appeal, asking Khartoum to allow relief agencies to send supplies to all affected regions. **********He appealed in particular for help for the southern Sudan, where the Government has been fighting a rebel group, the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, for more than 20 years.

Frustrated Efforts in the South **********In the past, the Sudan has had an uneasy relationship with relief organizations. United Nations officials and voluntary relief workers say the Government's attitude stems partly from embarrassment over not being able to do more for its own people. But the authorities have especially frustrated relief groups working in the south, believing they aid the rebels. **********Relief officials said that last month, however, the Government told them it no longer objects to their sending emergency food supplies to towns it controls in the south. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled fighting in the countryside to these towns, where they live in refugee camps, near starvation. **********The first hint that the Sudan's attitude toward foreign aid workers was changing came last November, officials say. After long negotiations, Khartoum promised the United Nations that it would work more closely with relief organizations in return for the Secretary General's beginning an international public appeal for about $70 million in emergency aid. **********The United Nations believes that there are more than 1.5 million refugees in the Khartoum area but expects this figure to grow to 2 million by the end of the year.

Five of the nation's largest carriers reported record profits for the spring quarter, and summer bookings suggest that the season is shaping up as one of the best for the industry as well. **********For the millions of Americans who took to the skies earlier in the decade, when one-way fares for transcontinental trips dropped into double figures, the outlook is less cheerful. Fares rose more than 15 percent in the 12 months ended in April, according to a study by Salomon Brothers, and analysts see no return soon to the discounting wars. **********The airlines are quick to point out that in the last decade fares have risen far less than the Consumer Price Index, but it has become clear that for the most part ''the cheap fares are gone and the public realizes it,'' said Lee Howard, executive vice president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm based in Washington. Investors Are Enthusiastic **********The financial vitality of the airlines, and their potential as takeover targets, is apparent in their popularity on Wall Street. In the most striking example yet of investors' enthusiasm, the stock of UAL Inc., the parent of United Airlines, jumped yesterday by $46.25, or 28 percent, to $210.75. As recently as early June, UAL was trading at $117. **********UAL's surge came after it confirmed that it had received a proposal to buy the airline from Marvin Davis, the investor who earlier had failed in a bid for Northwest Airlines. As a result, the Dow Jones transportation index rose 94.06 points, or 7.5 percent, to a record 1,344.06.  [ Page D1. ]  Other airline stocks also rose, amid speculation that American Airlines and Delta Air Lines might receive takeover offers. **********''The airlines have turned the corner as far as being a profitable industry,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. **********The industry's recent success can be attributed to a number of factors. One is the Darwinian tumult that has followed the deregulation of the industry in 1978. The upstart carriers like People Express that offered heavily discounted fares and medium-sized airlines like Pacific Southwest Airlines that provided competition on some routes have been acquired by major carriers. **********With Piedmont Airlines swallowed by USAir over the weekend, eight leading carriers - American, United, Delta, Northwest, Continental, T.W.A., Pan Am and USAir - now control more than 90 percent of the domestic market. One or two of these carriers control most of the gates at many of the nation's largest airports. **********Bargains can still be found. A child accompanied by a parent can fly free on certain days. And last week, Continental offered round-trip weekend-only fares at steep discounts through Labor Day. Its rivals matched the fares. **********But the airlines are also placing new restrictions on discount fares. For instance, they are offering fewer refundable tickets. ''The airlines are putting a lot of 25 percent penalties on tickets that used to be fully refundable,'' said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of Travel Agents. **********Airlines have also begun to restrict discounts for flights during rush hour. Business travelers have taken the brunt of the fare increases. Discount business fares, which carry a few restrictions, have risen 46.5 percent in the last year, said Jean Dalber, a spokeswoman for Runzheimer International, a consulting company that advises corporations. Higher Discount Fare **********For instance, a business discount fare for a flight from New York to San Francisco that cost $300 last year may now be as much as $440. **********The airlines are also chipping away quietly at their frequent-flier programs by raising the number of miles needed to earn free trips and placing restrictions on the use of the free tickets. For instance, American raised the number of miles needed for two round-trip coach tickets to Europe to 160,000, from 90,000. **********Sophisticated computer programs enable airlines to track buying patterns and get the most money for each ticket by constantly adjusting fares to reflect demand for a particular flight. This technique can be used to limit the availability of discounts. Financial Incentives Given **********At the same time, the carriers have been able to hold on to business through financial incentives to encourage travel agents to steer customers their way and through computer reservation systems that favor their flights by listing them before those of other carriers. **********Extra financial incentives are offered to travel agents who surpass their quota of tickets booked on an airline - a system that agents said favors larger carriers. **********''Management has learned to run the companies in a deregulated environment,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read. **********With moves like controlling the limited number of airport gates, owning computer reservation systems and offering frequent-flier programs to increase passenger loyalty, the nation's largest airlines have effectively blocked any upstart carriers from gaining a foothold. Only two of deregulation's offspring, Midway and America West, have survived the decade after deregulation, and industry experts say it is unlikely that a new airline will emerge soon. Statistics Reflect Gains **********The improvement in the airlines' financial picture is reflected in a number of statistics. The airlines have had revenue of 13.8 cents a passenger mile this year, up 11 percent from 12.5 cents in 1988, according to figures supplied by the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group. **********Full nondiscounted fares have risen to about 30 cents a mile this year, from about 20 cents a mile in 1983. In the past, as full fares rose, the airlines often offered bigger discounts, negating the impact for many travelers and for profits; but starting in December, new airline fare schedules began to reduce the effective discounts and the number of people receiving discounts. **********The bottom line is that profit as a percentage of the money invested in domestic airlines rose to 13.5 percent last year, from 7.5 percent in 1987, said Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. In the early 1980's the figure was as low as six-tenths of 1 percent. A Boom in Profits **********The successful airlines, as a result, are booming. AMR, the parent company of American, which surpassed United as the nation's largest airline last year, said profits in its most recent quarter rose 28 percent from the year-earlier quarter, to a record $178 million. NWA, parent of Northwest, also reported record profits, more than doubling its earnings, to $71 million. **********Earnings for Delta Air Lines, helped by a strike at rival Eastern, rose 85 percent, to a record $191 million. Earnings for UAL rose 13.5 percent, to a record $141 million, USAir Group gained 9 percent, to a record $101 million. **********One exception is Texas Air, which owns Continental and Eastern; it said it lost $109 million in the second quarter, in part because of the strike at Eastern. Another exception is the Pan Am Corporation, parent of the financially strapped airline. It reported a second-quarter loss of $7.7 million. **********The airlines have also been helped by the growth in overseas flights. United, which flies across the Pacific and recently announced that it planned to begin service to Europe, reported that international traffic was up 23 percent from a year earlier. Delta's was up 35 percent, American's 21 percent and Continental's 41 percent. Favorable Fuel and Labor Costs **********Finally, favorable costs for fuel and labor have helped the airlines prosper in recent years. Since 1981, fuel prices have dropped from $1.05 a gallon to about 58 cents. Fuel accounts for 15 percent of an airline's operating expense, compared with nearly a third early in the decade. **********The industry's labor costs are not rising as fast as in years past, partly because of the introduction in the last five years of a two-tier wage structure under which new employees are paid less than those hired before. Most of the top carriers now have some sort of two-tier wage system. As the airlines expand their fleets and hire more employees, a greater percentage of their work force will be earning the lower wages. **********Still, many airlines, like United and Northwest, are in contract negotiations, and the unions may win substantial wage increases. Effect of Eastern Strike **********While industry experts and analysts do not expect any problems soon for the industry, they note that some of the strong earnings reported for the second quarter have been inflated by the virtual absence of Eastern Airlines. The strike there has cripppled the carrier since its start in early March. **********The airlines, banking on continued growth, are busily expanding their fleets. They have ordered or placed options for 1,500 airplanes; the current fleet is 3,500. But if traffic projections are not realized because of a recession, a glut of planes could develop. **********But the airlines have taken measures to limit their vulnerability. Many of the orders are options to buy, allowing an airline to back out if traffic falters. The trend is toward leasing rather than buying airplanes, an alternative that puts less strain on an airline's cash supply. **********''In a good economic year, the airlines do very well,'' said Edward J. Starkman, an analyst with Paine Webber. ''What remains to be tested is what happens in a bad year.'' **********The airlines could also face increased pressure for more regulation. Few people are suggesting that the airlines be as regulated as they were before 1978, but Congress has held hearings on the concentration of the industry. And consumer groups including the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington have complained that an industry oligopoly leaves travelers with fewer choices and higher fares"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/01/business/company-news-lasmo-oil-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lasmo Oil Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Lasmo Oil Deal", "body_text": " **********The British oil company Lasmo said it would buy International Thomson Organization Ltd.'s British North Sea interests for $:358 million, or $623 million.

Impetus From S.E.C. Query **********The scandal became public only after the Securities and Exchange Commission asked European officials for help in uncovering who was behind the surge in trading in Triangle stock. **********On Thursday, Pierre Beregovoy, the Finance Minister, was called to testify before the National Assembly about his ministry's role in the affair. Government officials have become ensnared in it principally because Pechiney is state-owned, and they were aware of the Triangle acquisition before it was announced. **********The news media and opposition politicians have suggested that some Government officials might have told friends - perhaps casually, perhaps deliberately - about the upcoming Triangle acquisition and that those friends rushed to buy Triangle stock. **********There have been no accusations, however, that French officials enriched themselves, which distinguishes this affair from Japan's Recruit scandal in which numerous officials resigned after having received money or stock from a company eager to win political favors. 'Show a la Americaine **********The French called Mr. Beregovoy's two-and-a-half-hour testimony a ''show a la americaine,'' since he was appearing in a legislative hearing room filled with the obligatory klieg lights, elbowing journalists and a pack of hostile legislators eager to trip him up. **********Mr. Beregovoy said he favored setting up a criminal investigation after the Commission des Operations de Bourse, France's watered-down version of the S.E.C., submits a report on the scandal, due next Tuesday. **********''All the truth must be known,'' Mr. Beregovoy said. ''This affair must not be smothered.'' **********Some editorial writers have suggested that the Government would have sought to bury this affair - as previous French governments, left and right, have buried previous scandals - were it not for the S.E.C.'s involvement. Staff Director's Resignation **********Earlier this month Mr. Beregovoy's staff director, Alain Boublil, resigned after he was criticized over friendships with several Lebanese and French investors suspected of buying large amounts of Triangle stock before the acquisition was announced. Mr. Boublil has denied any wrongdoing, saying he knew beforehand about the Triangle acquisition because part of his job was to oversee strategies for state-owned companies. In this case Pechiney was eager to become the world's No. 1 packaging company by acquiring Triangle's American National Can subsidiary. **********Mr. Beregovoy defended his former right-hand man and others in his ministry. ''I have questioned, on their honor, colleagues who were involved in the operation,'' Mr. Beregovoy said. ''They responded that they had not committed any indiscretions.'' **********Making the matter more titillating for the French is that the news media have reported that one of President Francois Mitterrand's closest friends, Roget-Patrice Pelat, bought 50,000 shares of Triangle stock. Mr. Pelat, a retired executive who knows Mr. Mitterrand from their days together in a German prisoner of war camp, is a familiar sight around Paris, often accompanying Mr. Mitterrand on his walks after lunch. Extent of Insider-Trading Profits **********Several weeks ago Mr. Pelat admitted buying 10,000 Triangle shares in the open, but last week Le Monde, the Paris newspaper, reported that he had bought another 40,000 shares through secret bank accounts. Max Theret, a prominent Socialist business executive who bought 32,300 shares of Triangle, said he had bought the stock and had advised Mr. Pelat to do so. He said his actions were based solely on a belief that the packaging industry had huge promise. **********Investigators say some 220,000 Triangle shares were bought at about $10 a share the week before Pechiney announced it would buy Triangle for $56 a share. Investigators estimate that total insider-trading profits approached $10 million. **********With municipal elections near, the conservative opposition has been attacking the Socialists over the affair. Alain Juppe, Secretary-General of the conservative Rally for the Republic Party, outraged the Socialists by calling them ''the most rotten left'' in the world. Mr. Juppe said he was ''very worried about the risk of a cover-up,'' and he added that ''this affair is more serious than it looks.'' **********On Friday, Prime Minister Michel Rocard vigorously attacked such comments about the scandal, asserting that the conservatives had covered up many scandals of their own and that they were unfairly imputing guilt by association. Plan to Make Report Public **********On Thursday, President Mitterrand said that for the sake of openness and the reputation of France's financial markets, the Bourse Commission's report should be made public. **********The Socialists are also on the defensive because of suggestions that insider trading occurred just before a private group, backed at least tacitly by the Government, began an unsuccessful raid on Societe Generale, France's third-largest bank. The Socialists complain that former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac gave control of that bank to his close allies when his conservative Government privatized the bank in 1987. **********One reason the Pechiney scandal remains center stage is that since France does not have a powerful investigative agency like the S.E.C., the facts have come out one by one, day by day, forming a large, incriminating heap. All this is in sharp contrast to what happens in the United States, where the S.E.C. announces specific insider-trading charges one day -and often a guilty plea along with it -and then the affair is soon forgotten. Admiration for S.E.C.  As the Pechiney affair grows, the only party likely to come away with its reputation enhanced is the S.E.C. Government officials are accused of being loose-lipped and having greedy friends. The conservative opposition is criticized for dragging the image of France and its Bourse through the mud by playing up the scandal. The news organizations are attacked for spreading rumors, while the Bourse Commission has been called weak and timid. **********Everyone in France - except some brokerages that prefer the idea of self-regulation - seems to agree that the Bourse Commission should be more like the S.E.C. The French were impressed by the mountain of detail in a 12-page letter that the S.E.C. sent to Swiss authorities regarding the scandal, a letter that was leaked to French news organizations. **********On Friday, Swiss authorities ordered that bank records linked to the scandal be turned over to United States investigators. **********Unlike the S.E.C., the Bourse Commission, with less than one-tenth the staff and budget of its American counterpart, is not empowered to bring charges against inside traders. It must instead ask an investigating magistrate to do so. In France, insider trading is punishable by heavy fines and up to two years in jail. **********''It is important to reinforce its powers,'' Mr. Beregovoy said of the Bourse Commission.

But he said they lack money to start reconstruction projects in the war-ravaged countryside, although these would encourage the return of five million refugees from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. **********He said donors appeared reluctant to give more for fear this would help President Najibullah remain in power and because they wish to see a substantial return of refugees get under way first. He did not name countries other than the United States but suggested that a number of Western nations shared this approach. A Way to Attract Refugees **********Prince Sadruddin told a news conference that with most of the country's territory now in the hands of the rebels, the assistance he wants would go mainly to those living outside Government-controlled areas. Rebuilding villages, hospitals and schools would also encourage refugees to come back. **********''With the possibility of a military solution to the conflict discounted and a suitable political formula not in sight,'' Prince Sadruddin wrote in his latest report on his agency's operations, ''it is becoming clear that massive economic and humanitarian assistance administered by the United Nations offers the best prospect of achieving the degree of socioeconomic stability from which a political settlement and a large-scale return of refugees may emerge.'' **********Although donors had pledged $991.5 million as of Aug. 31 toward last year's United Nations appeal for $1.3 billion in Afghan aid, most of what they are offering is in the form of food, medical assistance and supplies, and most of this has not yet been delivered. As a result, Prince Sadruddin said, he has only $17 million in cash to finance reconstruction inside the country, with 60 percent of this donated by Japan.

Like everyone else, they must file their regular income tax returns by April 17. But if their Keoghs are considered ''frozen,'' they may also be facing a May 31 deadline to determine the future status of their plans. A failure to act could set off stiff tax liabilities. **********A Keogh, of course, is a retirement plan set up by self-employed professionals, owners of small businesses or salaried workers with sideline ventures. Like a corporate retirement plan, a Keogh lets you make tax-deductible annual contributions; earnings in the account build up tax-free until they are withdrawn at retirement. **********A ''frozen'' Keogh is a plan that is no longer accepting contributions. This can happen, for example, if self-employed people incorporate a business or give it up altogether and become employees. Once they do so, they are not eligible to make further contributions to their Keoghs. **********Frozen Keoghs are also created when the owner has already completely financed the plan. This happens in the case of a defined benefit Keogh plan, in which the owner decides how much income is needed at retirement and then makes annual contributions to reach that goal. The amount actuarially needed to finance the retirement income may be reached long before the retirement date. **********Other Keoghs become frozen at the point that the owners stop making contributions. Many self-employed professionals and business owners suspended contributions, for example, in the wake of tax law changes in 1982 that required Keogh owners to contribute certain minimum amounts to the plans on behalf of employees who were already covered. **********Whatever the reason, there are many frozen Keoghs on the books today. While they are no longer active in the sense of receiving new money, they continue to accumulate income on a tax-deferred basis. Most owners have been content to leave the plans in place until they reach retirement age and begin to draw down the funds. **********The problem with frozen plans, however, is that they must incorporate any changes in Federal law that affect qualified retirement plans. Now, because of recent changes in the tax law, ''it's become much less worthwhile for people to keep these plans in place,'' said Robert C. Wilke, technical consultant with Prentice-Hall Law and Business in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. **********At issue is a provision put into the 1986 tax act that goes beyond the 1982 change and that requires Keoghs - whether frozen or not - to cover a significant number of rank-and-file employees. The change also affects other qualified pension plans. It was added to prevent professionals, owners of small businesses and other highly compensated employees from receiving a disproportionate share of the benefits under these types of plans. **********Now, to qualify for tax breaks, Keoghs and other types of retirement plans must cover at least 50 employees or 40 percent of all those eligible, whichever is less. **********Obviously, the change does not affect Keogh holders who have no employees. To illustrate how the change might apply to the others, consider the case of a doctor who practiced on her own and set up a Keogh plan. When she incorporated her practice, she froze the Keogh. Now she employs two nurses and a receptionist. Under the new rules, she must set aside retirement funds for at least two of those employees or else end the plan. **********The rules were not scheduled to take effect until Jan. 1 of this year to give people time either to terminate - by rolling their money into another tax-deferred retirement vehicle - or amend the plan to include the required number of employees. Many professionals missed the deadline, however, because they were not aware of the change, tax experts say, and the Internal Revenue Service has just granted a short reprieve. Now, owners of frozen Keoghs have until May 31 to act. **********If they do nothing, all deferred income put into the pension plan must be picked up as taxable income on the date the plan becomes disqualified. For Keogh owners who have been setting aside large chunks of money over many years ''it's an extremely steep penalty, something that you'll do almost anything to avoid,'' said Frank R. Polance, a senior tax manager with the accounting firm of BDO Seidman in New York. **********Owners of frozen Keoghs have several options. Those who terminate their plans before the May 31 deadline can roll the funds over, without penalty, into an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan. **********There is another break to doing this - a 15 percent excise tax, generally imposed when pension plan assets are returned to an employer (the Keogh owner in this case), will not apply in this type of termination. **********For people who have ongoing businesses with employees, the decision to expand coverage of the plan or terminate is an individual one. They should compare the benefits of maintaining the plan - primarily better tax treatment of lump-sum distributions than I.R.A.'s provide - to the costs of covering current employees. **********The better tax treatment works this way: Money withdrawn as a lump sum from a Keogh plan at retirement may have the tax calculated using a special formula called five-year forward averaging. With five-year averaging, the tax rate used is the one that would apply to an amount equal to one-fifth of the payout. That rate could be much lower than the ordinary income tax rate used on a lump-sum withdrawal from an I.R.A. (Taxes in connection with an I.R.A. withdrawal can be minimized, however, if the money is taken out in the form of an annuity rather than in a lump sum.) Those who decide to terminate the plan and who cannot roll the funds over into another qualified plan, or simply prefer to manage the money themselves, must put the Keogh money into an I.R.A. within 60 days or be taxed on the distribution. The normal restrictions on I.R.A. contributions - the $2,000 annual cap and income limitations on tax deductibility of deposits - do not apply to rollovers. Whether the money is rolled over into another qualified plan or an I.R.A., earnings continue to build up tax-deferred. **********Given the new rules, does it pay to keep a frozen Keogh in place? For most people, ''the chances are 10 to 1 against keeping the plan,'' said Mr. Wilke of Prentice-Hall. **********People who have given up their businesses and joined companies are generally not affected by the new rules. Nonetheless, they may want to check with their employer to see whether the company's retirement plan will accept money rolled over from their frozen Keoghs. That way, the money will be managed by the party handling the company's plan, generally a professional money manager. But because of added record keeping, only about half of all plans will accept such rollovers, said Mr. Polance of BDO Seidman."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/16/world/carter-menil-rights-award-for-israeli-and-arab-groups.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Carter-Menil Rights Award For Israeli and Arab Groups", "print_headline": "Carter-Menil Rights Award For Israeli and Arab Groups", "body_text": " **********Two groups, one Israeli and one Palestinian, which document human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were selected to share the $100,000 Carter-Menil Rights Award today. **********Former President Jimmy Carter said the award would go to al-Haq, the West Bank affiliate of the International Commission of Jurists, and to B'Tselem, an Israeli group of lawyers, journalists and legislators. **********Al-Haq (Law in the Service of Man) has been a persistent critic of Israeli army tactics.

Dealers said one reason for the market's rally was a substantial purchase of Treasury bonds by a Japanese brokerage house that many dealers refer to as the ''Billion Dollar Buyer,'' although the house has been known at times to sell just as equally large amounts of Treasury bonds. **********Some dealers said the Billion Dollar Buyer was Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International's New York office, which first drew notice in October because of its huge purchases. But Eishi Wakabayashi, executive vice president at the company, said in a telephone interview that he could not talk about any of its specific business. **********The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, soared a half-point immediately after the opening, then eased slowly during the rest of the session. In late trading, the long bond was up 14/32, at 102 26/32, to yield 7.88 percent, down from 7.91 percent the day before and 7.86 percent a week ago.  Initial Impact of Job Data **********The fixed-income market thrives on negative economic news because it supposedly reduces the demand for credit and its impact on interest rates and inflation. Thus the Government report that unemployment had climbed to 5.3 percent in November might have been expected to enchance the value of outstanding fixed-income securities, and initially it did, However, several dealers, who asked not to be identified, said the initial euphoria in the bond market over the rise in unemployment for November quickly vanished when the Ocotber employment data were revised from a previously reported gain of 233,000 non-farm jobs to only 93,000. **********''The big revisions are not only disturbing but raise questions about the methods used in compiling them,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. **********Also unexpected in the Government's report was a decline of 27,000 manufacturing jobs last month. Normally, this decline, which was twice what many economists forecast, would have been bullish for the bond market. But dealers said the large revisions in the October data made this figure also suspect.  Quoted Price Paid **********''In any event, the Billion Dollar Buyer materialized again and snapped up an estimated $1.5 billion of long-term Treasury bonds off the screen of a West Coast dealer and perhaps another $500 million from local dealers,'' Mr. Sullivan said. He meant the buyer simply paid the price quoted on the Telerate screen, rather than negotiating a more favorable price, as large buyers typically do. **********Mr. Sullivan said: ''The fact that dealers were eager to sell such large amounts in a rising market to the so-called Billion Dollar Buyer tells us that dealer inventories may be larger than the Street thinks. In the midst of all this, the Federal Reserve was on the sidelines, which also suggests that it has no immediate intention to ease. Many of us think the Fed is comfortable with the funds at between 8 3/8 and 8 1/2 percent.'' **********Indeed, the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans and is thus considered the bedrock cost of credit, held steady at 8 3/8 percent, after trading a bit higher at 8 7/16 percent for most of the day.  Large Declines for Bills **********The discount rates on Treasury bills, usually most immediately influenced by the funds rate, posted large declines. The 90-day bills lost 10 basis points, at 7.59 percent; the six-month bills fell eight basis points, to 7.33 percent, and the one-year bill rate dropped 10 basis points, to 7.20 percent. **********The Treasury announced that it planned to auction $9.75 billion of new one-year bills on Thursday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/01/world/joint-chiefs-urge-us-restraint-on-star-wars-in-strategic-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1989-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Joint Chiefs Urge U.S. Restraint On 'Star Wars' in Strategic Talks", "print_headline": "Joint Chiefs Urge U.S. Restraint On 'Star Wars' in Strategic Talks", "body_text": " **********Recommending an important change in the American position in the Geneva talks on strategic arms, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have proposed that the United States no longer insist on the right to eventually deploy extensive anti-missile defenses. **********The position taken by the Joint Chiefs is a fresh indication that top United States military leaders are skeptical about the prospects of the ''Star Wars'' program begun in the Reagan Administration. **********Representatives of the chiefs have reportedly argued that the Soviet Union might be in a better position to deploy new anti-missile defenses than the United States.

The Geneva arms talks, which cover long-range nuclear arms and anti-missile systems, are scheduled to resume on June 19. Chiefs' Advice Is Opposed **********The Joint Chiefs' advice is at odds with positions taken by civilian Defense Department officials, who strongly support ''Star Wars'' defenses, and by others in the Bush Administration, including State Department officials. **********Reportedly, no decision has been made. President Bush said in a recent speech that the United States should deploy anti-missile defenses as soon as they are ready. **********At issue is whether to affirm President Reagan's three-part negotiating position on anti-missile systems. **********Under President Reagan's approach, Washington and Moscow would agree not to exercise their rights to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty through 1994. The ABM treaty allows each side to withdraw from the agreement on six months' notice if ''extraordinary events'' jeopardize its ''supreme interests.'' Reagan Would Allow ABM's **********The two sides would have the right to carry out extensive anti-missile testing under the Reagan Administration's ''broad'' interpretation of the ABM treaty. After the period of non-withdrawal expires, each side would have a clear right to deploy extensive anti-missile defenses, according to the third plank of the Reagan Administration's approach. **********Moscow has argued for a somewhat longer period of non-withdrawal from the ABM pact and tighter testing constraints during that period. Moscow also rejected the idea of codifying a right to deploy ''Star Wars'' defenses. **********In advocating a change in the American stance, the Joint Chiefs have said that the United States should no longer insist on an explicit right eventually to deploy extensive anti-missile defenses. **********Under the chiefs' approach, once the period of non-withdrawal expired the two sides would continue to observe the ABM treaty. Each side could later withdraw from that agreement on six months' notice if it decides that its ''supreme interests'' have been jeopardized. Less Money Proposed **********The chiefs' recommendation follows other moves that indicate that the top military leaders are skeptical about ''Star Wars'' and wary of steps that might lead to abandoning the ABM treaty. **********In April, the chiefs recommended a much lower level of appropriations for the Star Wars program than was advocated by civilian Defense Department officials. The chiefs advised proceeding with research and testing while avoiding any commitment to deployment. **********An Administration official said that the latest recommendation also reflects a concern that political objections on Capitol Hill as well as technological obstacles may further delay the ''Star Wars'' program. **********''There is a concern that we won't be ready to deploy and that the Russians will be able to able to move forward with more ground-based defenses,'' said the official, who is familar with the Joint Chiefs' stance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/11/business/patents-developing-machinery-the-size-of-a-molecule.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1989-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Developing Machinery the Size of a Molecule", "print_headline": "Patents; Developing Machinery the Size of a Molecule", "body_text": " **********Physicists from the University of Colorado and Boston University won a patent this week for a way to make patterns that could be used in developing molecule-sized machinery. **********The invention consists of a thin film covered with regularly spaced holes measuring about 100 angstroms in diameter, or about one one-hundred millionth of a meter. **********Kenneth Rothschild, a biophysicist at Boston University, said the regularity of the holes could make the structure useful as a plug-in board for tiny switches made from biological molecules.

Gorbachev. **********The ebullient crowd of about 150,000 protesters and spectators rallied to show support for a hunger strike on the opening day of the first Chinese-Soviet summit meeting in 30 years. **********The crowd was significant not only for its size and the shadow it cast over the summit meeting, but also because it marked the first time that intellectuals and workers organized themselves to join the students in a demonstration. Previously, workers frequently took part in demonstrations, but not in any organized way. 'Day Will Go Down in History' **********Intellectuals said both Mr. Gorbachev's visit and the struggle of the hunger strikers had inspired them to march. Many protesters seem to regard Mr. Gorbachev as a major reformer, and they have tried to draw contrasts between him and Chinese leaders. **********''In the Soviet Union, they have Gorbachev,'' read a banner carried by students. ''In China, we have whom?'' **********Taking pains to skirt the path of the demonstrators, the Government's motorcade of cars, which included Mercedes-Benzes, ushered Mr. Gorbachev into the hall through a back door. **********''Sell the Mercedes-Benzes to pay the national debt!'' shouted several thousand citizens as they marched into Tiananmen Square, where the hunger strikers, visibly weakened on their third day without food, lay sprawled in one corner under the scorching sun. **********''This day will go down in history,'' said Zhao Xiaoyan, a reporter with Science and Technology Daily, who marched to the square with a large group of journalists. ''Today, we have gone beyond the students. It it clear that the Chinese people believe that the Communist Party cannot continue to adopt the kind of attitude it takes toward its people.'' Demands of the Protesters **********The demands of the protesters included press freedom, more representative government, less corruption and lower inflation. The common theme was that the Government did not listen enough to the people. **********There were few policemen or troops patrolling the streets. The municipal authorities had planned to cordon off the entire area around the square to prepare for the ceremonial reception of Mr. Gorbachev. But the leaders apparently changed their minds. **********Today's demonstration, which was one of the biggest held so far, was unusual because it galvanized people to organize on a large scale. **********''For years, there has been so much talk of weakness among Chinese intellectuals, about their having no spine,'' said Zha Jianying, a young writer who marched today. ''This protest was symbolically important because it was the first time in a long while that intellectuals have taken collective political action.'' #100 Taken to Hospitals Although students had sealed off an area for the hunger strikers to protect them from the shoving crowds, the fasting of the young students moved some demonstrators to tears, as they watched ambulances carry weakened students to the hospital. **********A team of medical students dispersed salt tablets and glucose. But by late this evening more than 100 strikers who had fainted or lost consciousness had been taken to hospitals. **********''Tomorrow, we will continue with our hunger strike as we did today, until we have a real dialogue with the Government,'' said Wang Chao, a once-fiery student leader who spoke in faltering whispers as she hunched under a jacket to escape the blazing sun. **********Miss Wang continued to give orders on the students' next moves. Some of the movement's other leaders have not taken part in the hunger strike so that they can continue to act as negotiators with the Government. 'Concerns We All Care About' **********''The hunger stikers are raising concerns that we all care about,'' said Hong Jinyao, a 33-year-old worker. **********The student protesters are demanding direct talks between their own chosen delegates and Government representatives. They insist that these talks be broadcast live. They also have asked for a positive re-evaluation of the student movement. **********In a three-hour meeting today between Communist Party representatives and members of the official student union, Yan Mingfu, a top party official, indicated that the Government would consider their demands. In a hint of a major concession, he suggested that a re-evaluation may be possible. **********The official New China News Agency quoted Mr. Yan as saying, ''The massive demonstrations by the students on April 27 and May 4 should be positively assessed, except for the fact that the demonstrators failed to apply for approval with the relevant departments.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/business/business-people-nwa-bidder-only-40-is-a-seasoned-expert.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1989-06-05", "snippet": "LEAD: In late March, Alfred Checchi notified NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, that his Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm owned 4.9 percent of the company's stock and would consider taking it private in a leveraged buyout deal.", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;\nNWA Bidder, Only 40, Is a Seasoned Expert", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;\nNWA Bidder, Only 40, Is a Seasoned Expert", "body_text": " **********LEAD: In late March, Alfred Checchi notified NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, that his Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm owned 4.9 percent of the company's stock and would consider taking it private in a leveraged buyout deal. **********In late March, Alfred Checchi notified NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, that his Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm owned 4.9 percent of the company's stock and would consider taking it private in a leveraged buyout deal. **********Since then, Mr. Checchi's overture has taken a back seat to attempts by other outsider groups to acquire NWA, though he remains, quietly, a strong contender in the fight for control of the airline company. **********Mr. Checchi (pronounced Check-ee) declined to speak on the record about his intentions, but he is one of up to six bidders for NWA.

He has said Mr. Bush did not get timely intelligence that would have enabled American military forces to block the movement of troops loyal to Gen.

Televised Dispute **********Senator Boren repeated his charges on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' and asserted that the Senate panel had given the Administration all the money and authority it had sought for activities ''relating to Panama.'' **********Mr. Scowcroft disputed this statement and asserted that the committee's views, expressed in closed meetings, hindered the Administration from carrying out the sort of advance planning with the coup leaders that the critics said was needed. **********Government officials who declined to be identified say that the disagreement between Senator Boren and Mr. Scowcroft stemmed in part from an episode in July 1988 when the lawmakers objected to a plan by the Reagan Administration to support Panamanian officers plotting a coup at that time. **********At the 1988 hearing, Reagan Administration officials told the senators that they could not fully control Col. Eduardo Herrera, the leader of that coup, and could not guarantee the life of General Noriega if the plan, by the Central Intelligence Agency, went forward. The plan ruled out the use of the American bases as a staging area and was said to have involved less than two dozen Panamanian officers. Criticized for Different Reasons **********Some committee members, including Senator Cohen, viewed the plan as a thinly disguised attempt to circumvent the restrictions against assassination. Others on the panel, including Mr. Boren, felt the plan was too modest and too risky to have a chance of success. **********The deliberations, Government officials said, resulted in a letter from the committee to the Administration warning against proceeding with the plan. **********Government officials said the committee also objected when the Reagan Administration returned with a similar plan in October 1988, saying a decision should be deferred until after the American Presidential elections. **********Earlier this year, the C.I.A. broke off ties with Colonel Herrera.

Monopoly Danger **********The growing dominance of the big leasing companies also worries these analysts who say the lessors' large fleets have given them a monopoly, forcing carriers who need planes to lease, even if they would rather buy. Since short-term leases, like car rentals, cost more than long-term purchase, this may work against the long-range health of the industry, they say. **********Although GPA Group and ILFC dominate the business, their profits have attracted dozens of new companies to the field. Many of these companies raise capital through limited partnerships to buy used aircraft which they lease back to the airlines. Critics say the risks of trading in used airplanes are not adequately disclosed to unsophisticated investors, who can buy into these funds with as little as $2,000 in an I.R.A. account. **********But analysts say the lessors gave the airlines much-needed flexibility, and stabilized and expanded the market for used aircraft. **********Airlines turn to leasing companies for several reasons. Operating leases allow airlines to add planes when and where they need them, without adding debt. For airlines short on capital, in a post-deregulation world where routes change often, operating leases may be the perfect financial tool. For newly formed airlines or recently privatized national carriers that lack credit histories, they are often the only financing available. **********The leasing companies owe their situation to the fact that they made substantial orders before the boom began, without commitments from airlines, so they can now provide aircraft to any carrier that can pay a first and a last month's rent. With backlogs stretched well into the 1990's, aircraft manufacturers can offer a buyer a place on an increasingly long line. **********They say complaints from a few carriers amount to sour grapes from companies that failed to make orders in time. **********''We came up with our forecasts long before this euphoria for new airplanes began,'' said Louis L. Gonda, executive vice president and co-founder of ILFC. ''The airline industry procrastinated just a bit too long in replacing airplanes.'' Orders for Aircraft **********In 1988 lease companies placed firm orders for 145 aircraft from the Boeing Company, or 22.8 percent of the 636 planes ordered; 46 aircraft from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, or 18.7 percent of its 246 firm orders; and 31 aircraft from the European Airbus Industrie consortium, or 15.3 percent of 203 firm orders. **********With some peaks and valleys, lessors' orders as a percentage of the total have been growing in the past decade. ''What has happened is they have snarffed up all of the order positions,'' said Mortem S. Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm. ''If someone wants an aircraft now, the only place to get it is the mega-lessors.'' **********That has added a third party to the traditionally close relationship between aircraft makers and their customers. **********''The leasing companies do bring something to the marketplace; they are able to finance airplanes to airlines that we would not be able to,'' said Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer. ''But there is concern that they would become a buffer between us and our customers. We have to work to see that that doesn't happen. We do some limiting of the production we will sell to lessors.'' No Signs of Quotas **********Leasing executives say that they have seen no signs of quotas imposed by the manufacturers, and that imposing such limits would discriminate against small carriers that depend on leases and would possibly be illegal. **********Mr. Gonda of ILFC said the complaints that the lessors had a monopoly were unfounded. **********''To presume that airlines are going to overpay in any way because operating lessors have ordered these planes today is just not on,'' Mr. Gonda said. ''The competition is too intense between ILFC and GPA.'' In addition, the lessors' volume buying, strong credit ratings and adroit reselling of used aircraft lower the cost of leasing, he said. **********It would cost about $255,000 a month to lease a McDonnell Douglas MD-88, a popular midsize plane. The mortgage payment on such a plane, which sells for about $25 million, would be about $180,000, assuming up-front construction payments of about $8 million, with the balance financed over 10 years. Numbers Work Out **********The numbers work out profitably for the lessors. In 1988 GPA had net income of $101.4 million on revenue of $649.6 million. ILFC had net income of $43.4 million on revenue of $213.2 million. **********Some carriers find the cost too high. Many prefer to own their planes, or buy them and make their own sale-leaseback arrangements with financial institutions. Phoenix-based America West Airlines, which began operation in 1983 with leased aircraft and still leases four times as many planes as it owns, has 40 airplanes on order from Boeing., all of which will be owned or placed in long-term leases with financial institutions. **********''It's cheaper,'' said Michael J. Conway, America West's president. ''When you wind up in a situation where the only place you can get an airplane from is ILFC or GPA, you wind up competing with the likes of United and American, and you wind up paying an amount of money that is proportionately higher than what United or American is paying.'' Growing in Popularity **********The operating lease continues to grow in popularity, even among some airlines that have the wherewithal for conventional financing. GPA estimates that of the world fleet of 6,000 aircraft in 1981, 360, or 6 percent, were on operating leases. By 1988, the world fleet grew to 7,900 planes, of which 1,250, or nearly 16 percent, are on operating leases. Five years ago, Delta Air Lines had no leases; today 52 percent of its fleet is leased. About 43 percent of American Airlines' fleet is leased. **********It is not, however, a subject the airlines are keen to talk about. Officials at Delta, American, Northwest, USAir and United either declined to comment on the leasing business, or did not return repeated telephone calls. **********A shortage of capital and the need for new aircraft may leave airlines no choice. GPA estimates that growth, plus the need to retire and replace about 2,400 airplanes, will require a total of about 7,000 new aircraft by the year 2000, at a cost of about $400 billion. In the next five years, GPA estimates that the airlines will need more than 2,000 new aircraft costing about $105 billion. Of that amount, $25 billion is expected to come from the operating lessors. Not Enough Capital **********''There is simply not enough capital to supply the money for these purchases, nor can you structure anyone's balance sheet right,'' said Douglas G. Matthews, president of the Intercredit Corporation, an operating lessor based in Atlanta. Operating leases offer ''an alternative source of capital, better balance-sheet treatment, and flexibility.'' **********While some analysts say the lessors make speculative orders and would not hesitate to sell or drop their order positions in a recession, leasing executives say this is not true. Officials of GPA and ILFC point out that they have never sold an order position, or canceled an order, unlike some airlines. **********Their orders are speculative in that they are not committed to specific customers, but they are based on careful research of global demand, said Maurice A. Foley, GPA's president and chief operating officer. He said the real speculators were the airlines. Some of their ''orders made over the last nine months have a certain element of treating aircraft as commodities,'' based on their size and the number of options as opposed to firm orders, he said. ''We've bought over 40 airplanes in the last two years from airlines who were surrendering positions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/15/business/company-news-centaur-partners-lifts-offer-for-pennwalt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Centaur Partners Lifts Offer for Pennwalt", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Centaur Partners Lifts Offer for Pennwalt", "body_text": " **********Centaur Partners, a New York investment group, today raised its bid for the Pennwalt Corporation to $110 a share from $100 a share. **********The shares of the chemical producer stock jumped $7.375, to $113.125.

Aquino was involved in this month's coup attempt against her. **********Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez said that Government investigators had sworn statements from three people who said they saw the opposition leader, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, conferring at his residence with Gregorio B. Honasan, a cashiered colonel identified as one of the leaders of the military rebellion against Mrs. Aquino. **********The statements were made by three waiters employed by a luxury hotel owned by a businessman closely associated with former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. They said that while catering at the Enrile residence in an exclusive Manila neighborhood on Dec.1, the first day of the rebellion, they saw Mr. Honasan and Geronimo Velasco, Mr. Marcos's Energy Minister, meeting with Mr. Enrile. Senator Denies Accusations **********In a statement, Mr. Enrile denied the accusations against him, saying they were part of ''the grand designs of the administration to silence the lone opposition in the Senate.'' **********President Aquino had implicated Mr. Enrile in the plot to take over her Government in a speech early this month. But no formal charges have been made against him. **********As Mr. Marcos's Defense Minister in 1986, Mr. Enrile led a military mutiny that sparked a popular uprising which overthrew Mr. Marcos and help install Mrs. Aquino as President. Mr. Honasan was for many years the head of Mr. Enrile's security force and was a founder of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, which is held responsible for two of the five military mutinies of the Aquino presidency. **********Mr. Enrile remained Defense Minister in the Aquino Administration. But in November 1986, after the Government linked him to a coup conspiracy, Mr. Enrile was dismissed by Mrs. Aquino. Months later, he was elected to the Senate. 'Cobra and Mongoose' **********Military officials say the seven-day military rebellion that came close to toppling Mrs. Aquino this month had civilian backing. They say investigations showed that the conspirators include several generals, businessmen, opposition politicians, Marcos supporters, even officers of several gun clubs. **********In her speech, Mrs. Aquino had also implicated Vice President Salvador H. Laurel and one of her cousins, an industrialist and Marcos associate named Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. Mr. Cojuangco, who went into exile in the United States when Mr. Marcos fell, slipped back into the Philippines one week before the rebellion. **********Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, the military chief of Manila, described the list of suspected plotters, including Marcos supporters and leaders of the 1986 rebellion against him, as ''an alliance between the cobra and the mongoose.'' **********Mrs. Aquino has vowed to punish those who took part in the latest mutiny. This week she is expected to announce changes in her Cabinet in an effort to address popular grievances about Government incompetence which helped fuel the rebellion. Aquino Popularity Rating Up **********A survey last week in Manila showed that despite these grievances, Mrs. Aquino's popularity rating had soared to 60 percent from 35 percent in July. **********But pollsters said the survey showed support for ''constitutionalist politics rather than the current administration.''

Bush Administration officials were also trying to avoid involving the United States in a shooting war and felt that the request was not necessary to keep President Corazon C. Aquino in power. **********The conversation between Mr. Ramos and American officials, which took place early Friday morning, Washington time, followed an earlier appeal by the Philippine Government to use American military force to stop rebel aircraft either in the air or on the ground, Administration officials said. **********In response to that request, Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, devised the plan to fly American F-4 jets over Philippine rebel-controlled air bases to intimidate the rebels from launching the planes and rejected the idea of attacking the rebel planes on the ground. **********The disclosure of the Philippine requests sheds new light on the Administration's handling of the crisis. **********Bush Administration officials said that they sought to shape a response that would neutralize the rebels without necessarily involving the United States in a direct conflict. **********This reflected concerns of American officials that more direct intervention would represent an undesirable intrusion in Philippine internal affairs, could breed resentment in the Philippines against American military bases there and spark a wider conflagration. **********Asked about the new disclosures, a White House spokeswoman said the Administration would not comment. **********The Philippine request to stop rebel aircraft either in the air or on the ground was received in Washington around 11 P.M. on Thursday.

The rebels would be informed that the American jets would shoot down the rebel planes if they tried to take off. But the United States would not join the Philippine F-5 planes in attacking the T-28 planes and the rebel helicopters on the ground. **********After the option was agreed among the senior officials, Vice President Quayle called Air Force One and presented it to President Bush, who was en route to the Malta summit meeting. **********Bush Administration officials said that they felt time was of the essence. **********Just before Mr. Quayle's call to Mr. Bush, which came at about 12:30 A.M. on Friday, Bush Administration official had received reports that the rebels had warned Mrs. Aquino that they would attack the palace if she did not evacuate it in 20 minutes. **********About 10 minutes after Mr. Quayle presented the plan to Mr. Bush, the President ordered the F-4's into the air."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/20/business/company-news-airbus-forecast.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airbus Forecast", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Airbus Forecast", "body_text": " **********A recent boom in world aircraft orders could help Airbus Industrie break even by 1994, a year earlier than previously forecast, an Airbus spokeswoman said.

But it was Japan that stemmed the tide of the mini-crash that rocked most world markets in mid-October, and this week it was Japan that reacted most enthusiastically when the Federal Reserve seemed to signal it wanted to ease credit. **********As a result, yesterday's rise of 61.83 points, to 35,657.42, in the Nikkei 225, the most widely watched index of Japanese stocks, left the average just 32 points, or 0.09 percent, below the record it set on Sept. 28. The Dow Jones industrial average, by contrast, remains 6.7 percent below its record, set on Oct. 9. **********''People have been hoping the Fed will ease, and that that will weaken the dollar,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, an American who this summer was promoted to chief fundamental analyst and strategist at Nikko Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. **********To the Japanese, such a course holds out the possibility of easing two problems that have faced the Japanese market. Interest rates have been pushed up, in Tokyo as well as in much of Europe, to fight the dollar's strength and to stem inflation rates that seem high by their standards. ''This could gradually develop room for the Bank of Japan to ease and let interest rates fall,'' Mr. Prager said. **********The Fed's easing on Tuesday, signaling that it was willing to allow the Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend money to each other - to fall from 8 3/4 percent to 8 1/2 percent, got a hesitant response that day in the American stock market. The Dow rose almost 15 points, but both the over-the-counter market and the American Stock Exchange saw more stocks fall than rise in price. **********But in Japan on Wednesday, share prices rose rapidly, with the Nikkei average surging 325 points, or almost 1 percent, and the American market joined in the party later the same day, as the Dow rose 26 points in a rally that was broader than any since the Oct. 19 slump. The advance slowed in Tokyo yesterday, and prices fell in New York. **********Whether the Japanese market can keep climbing depends in part on whether the American easing of interest rates really does help bring down the dollar. The yen rallied a bit just after the Fed move but then gave up much of its gains. The worry over relatively high interest rates - 10-year Japanese bonds now yield 5.6 percent and savers can get 6.7 percent on three-month bank certificates of deposit - is widely viewed as being one reason that stock prices fell in early October, before the drop began in the United States. **********Those rates are not high by American standards, but the spread between Japanese and United States Government bond yields - about 2.3 percentage points - is the lowest since 1986. If an even narrower spread is needed to bring down the dollar, the Japanese would much rather see that come from lower American rates than from higher Japanese ones. **********Foreign investors have generally stayed away from the Japanese market this year, reflecting concerns about the poor performance of the market, as well as about the high price-earnings ratios in Japan - often two or three times what they are in Europe or the United States. And some of those earnings, as William L. Clauss, a market strategist with Banca della Svizzera Italiana, notes, include gains from stock speculation. ''If the market goes down,'' he said yesterday, ''corporate profits will follow.'' **********The Nikkei is up a respectable 18.2 percent this year, in yen terms, but after adjusting for the rise of the dollar, the index is up just 4.8 percent. By contrast, the Dow is up 20.1 percent. **********After becoming net buyers of Japanese shares in late 1988, as the dollar was falling, the foreign institutions kept up their purchases only through February. They then began selling shares, according to Japanese Government figures, reaching a peak net sale of about $3.4 billion in June. Although foreigners were net buyers in August, they returned to selling in September. **********Since the end of June, the Nikkei average has marginally outperformed the Dow, but that gain has been small consolation for many American portfolio managers who own Japanese stocks. The big export-oriented companies have generally not done that well this year as Japanese investors focused on smaller companies and on ones that could cash in on the consumer boom. **********The Japanese savings rate remains high, but more and more consumers are borrowing as they seek to enjoy luxuries befitting their wealth. Outstanding Japanese consumer debt for purchases of goods and services was about 16 trillion yen ($115 billion) at the end of 1986. Less than three years later, it is more than 65 trillion yen ($450 billion)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/01/business/the-media-business-golan-quits-cannon-group-to-form-his-own-company.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1989-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 405, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Golan Quits Cannon Group To Form His Own Company", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Golan Quits Cannon Group To Form His Own Company", "body_text": " **********Menahem Golan, the former head of Cannon Group Inc., has resigned his remaining posts to form his own film production company, Cannon said yesterday. **********Mr. Golan had been a director and senior executive vice president of Cannon and chairman and head of creative affairs at its entertainment subsidiary. **********His departure marks the end of a reign over one of the more volatile small movie studios in Hollywood.

Hyman, vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence/Morgan Grenfell Inc., predicted that the end of the 1980's stock market boom would be evident when investors began to rationalize their speculations with pronouncements about peace with the Soviet Union and an era of uninterrupted economic growth. **********Two years later the Dow Jones industrial average set records and the stock market is filled with optimistic chatter about the financial benefits of the end of the cold war and the possibility of an economic ''soft landing'' - the bottom of an economic cycle without recession or high inflation. **********These confident pronouncements are causing some investment experts to worry. They recall the elements of self-delusion that punctuated investors' confident boasts in 1972 before the market fell almost 50 percent and in 1929 before the October crash and the Great Depression of the 1930's. **********''Every piece of information is being interpreted in the most positive light,'' said Michael A. Petrino, president of Matrix Capital Management, a Stamford investment management firm with $1 billion in client accounts. ''The higher the market gets, the less grounded in reality the expectation is.'' **********Last Friday, for example, the August employment report was stronger than market participants had anticipated - bad news for stocks and bonds. But later in the day, investors focused on the Purchasing Managers' Index, which indicated the economy was losing steam - good news for stocks and bonds. **********In recent months the list of rationalizations for higher prices has lengthened as investors try to explain why after advancing almost 2,000 points since August 1982, the Dow should go still higher. Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, has declared that the combination of a soft landing and the end of the cold war can send the Dow to 4,500. **********Other popular explanations for higher prices include the imminent return of the individual investor, the shortage of stocks, the ''death of Communism,'' and the hope for new economic markets in Poland, the Soviet Union and China. **********Of course, many of the explanations for higher stock prices have some basis in reality. Government reports do continue to indicate that the economy is healthy and that inflation does not appear to be rising. Bloomingdale's is holding discussions to open a store in the Soviet Union, and Aeroflot is offering give-aways to attract Western passengers. **********But as stock market and economic historians point out, the end of speculative periods is typically marked by excessive, almost desperate confidence in the future. ''This is a world inhabited not by people who have to be persuaded to believe but by people who want an excuse to believe,'' John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in his 1954 book ''The Great Crash.'' **********As Mr. Galbraith and others have noted, investors in the 1920's voiced many of the same justifications that market participants are discussing now: disarmament in Europe, a shortage of stocks that would give them a scarcity value and unlimited prosperity. Then as now aviation stocks were popular as investors anticipated the era. **********''The future is brilliant,'' Thomas W. Lamont, a senior partner of the investment banking firm now known as Morgan Stanley & Company, said in September 1929. **********Then as now, almost every piece of economic information was interpreted as good news. ''Prosperity was going to last forever,'' recalled Philip L. Carret, the 90-year-old chairman of Carret & Company, a New York money management firm, who sees parallels in the current optimism and in 1929. **********In 1972, investors also painted a bright picture just before a wrenching two-year bear market. **********At that time it was also generally accepted that even in a recession the earnings of the ''nifty fifty'' growth companies like Polaroid, Avon and Coca-Cola were dependable and would support the extraordinary prices investors were paying. **********These days as the tidal wave of confidence rolls through the stock market, some professionals are beginning to feel slightly edgy. Yesterday the stock market tumbled 24.89 points on the Dow Jones industrial average to 2,719.79. And on Tuesday Barton M. Biggs, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, told clients to reduce stocks by 10 percent. ''I think the global equity markets have heard and discounted a lot of good political and economic news, and a little bad news might be very disconcerting,'' he said. **********But others are not yet ready to lower the curtain on the 1980's bull market. Price/earnings multiples are not as high as they have been at the top of other bull markets. And there is a possibility that investors could spin more fantasies to explain higher prices. **********''I do think there's room for people to get more silly,'' Mr. Petrino of Matrix said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/10/business/looking-to-the-company-to-provide-the-necessities.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1989-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 446, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Looking to the Company To Provide the Necessities", "print_headline": "Looking to the Company To Provide the Necessities", "body_text": " **********Corporate paternalism has long been in retreat in the West because it is largely viewed as an infringement on personal freedom. **********But in the Soviet Union, the paternalistic company is welcomed by its employees because it provides necessities in an economy in which rubles alone do not guarantee supply.

The Volga auto plant has built housing for virtually all its employees and often charges less than $30 a month in rent. Local health services, a sports stadium, film center, concert hall and summer camps are provided by the plant. Agreements With Farms **********Waiting in line for groceries can take hours of workers' time, so the plant raises hogs and has agreements with nearby collective farms to insure food supplies. Typically, the factory will provide the cooperating farms with cars, repair their equipment and supply labor during harvest time in return for getting the first call on farm produce. **********The plant has set up special stores for its employees, but the most unusual perquisite is a series of ''emotional relaxation rooms.'' In pre-Gorbachev days, Western cynics might have deemed them a form of mind control, but today, they might be regarded either as amusing or perhaps even an innovation. It is explained that the program was developed by a Soviet psychotherapist and combines elements of ''deep relaxation'' and self-hypnosis. **********Most of the light in the rooms is filtered through four aquariums on each side wall.

Sununu, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and other senior aides. **********Asked by a reporter if he was heading to Tokyo with ''new initiatives,'' he said, ''We're ready to roll, yeah.'' Trip Scheduled Around Funeral **********The President said it was important for the United States not to take the Asian nations for granted as the new Administration tackles other problems. **********''There is something more than symbolism,'' he said of the trip to China, his fifth since he left there there in 1975 after serving as chief American envoy. ''That relationship is fundamental to any foreign policy equation of the United States.'' **********''We don't ever want to neglect our friends,'' he said. ''Yes, things in the Pacific seem to be going reasonably well, but we are a Pacific power and this visit will demonstrate that we intend to stay a Pacific power.'' **********Before leaving Washington, senior Administration officials sought to lower expectations by noting that the trip was scheduled around the funeral Friday of Emperor Hirohito. Private Meetings With Leaders **********Briefing reporters Tuesday on the eve of the visit, Mr. Scowcroft said that ''the substance will not be extensive,'' although Mr. Bush is scheduled to hold private talks with more than a dozen heads of state in Tokyo. **********''This trip is mainly an opportunity to have serious discussions at the outset of his Administration with such important Asian friends and allies and to reaffirm that the United States plans to play a strong and affirmative role as an Asian power,'' Mr. Scowcroft said. **********Mr. Bush's three-day stay in Tokyo is to include private meetings with Japan's new Emperor, Akihito, and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. **********The White House also made public the President's written answers to questions submitted by the Kyodo News Service, in which Mr. Bush minimized several potential disputes, including trade friction between the world's two largest economies, Japan's military spending and Japanese investment in the United States, which amounted to about 13 percent of all foreign investment by the end of 1987. Tokyo's Foreign-Aid Package **********Mr. Bush said, ''It is important that our allies assume greater responsibility in the cause of global peace and prosperity.'' But he added: ''It is not for me to prescribe Japan's role in the world. The decision is up to the Government and people of Japan.'' **********While Japan's trade surplus with the United States has been edging down, American officials estimate that it will still total about $80 billion by the end of the year. **********Even so, Mr. Takeshita has received a favorable response from the Bush Administration by proposing to spend $10 billion in foreign aid in the fiscal year that begins in April. That is an increase of 7.6 percent and would surpass proposed American spending by $1 billion. **********Mr. Bush told Kyodo that the Administration was ''encouraged'' by Japan's military spending, although ''there was still room for greater improvement.'' Japan is planning to spend about 5.9 percent of its gross national product on defense, a percentage that some American lawmakers have asserted should be higher. **********Mr. Bush has meetings with about a dozen leaders, including President Francois Mitterrand of France, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, President Chaim Herzog of Israel, President Richard von Weizsacker of West Germany, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, President Jose Sarney of Brazil, King Baudouin of Belgium, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, Prime Minster Turgut Ozal of Turkey, and Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/02/business/business-people-commodore-fills-job-left-vacant-since-87.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 439, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commodore Fills Job Left Vacant Since '87", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Commodore Fills Job Left Vacant Since '87", "body_text": " **********After reporting strong quarterly earnings this week, Commodore International Ltd. announced yesterday that it had named Mehdi Ali, a managing director at Dillon, Read & Company, as its new president. **********Mr. Ali, 43 years old, has been a member of Commodore's board since August and a special adviser to the personal computer company for three years. **********Mr. Ali fills a vacant job at the West Chester, Pa., company.

''The new anti-drug strategy hasn't arrived here yet,'' a senior United States official said. **********As a result, little is being done to stop the growth of the cocaine business in either country. Peasants are expanding coca fields, and shipments of semi-refined cocaine from Peru are picking up after a brief decline. Also, more of the final processing, usually done in Colombia, appears to be taking place in Peru, United States officials said. **********In Peru, where a guerrilla war is intensifying, the army is pursuing a strategy that is allowing coca growers and drug traffickers to prosper. **********Shining Path, Peru's main guerrilla organization, has become deeply involved in the narcotics industry, serving as broker for coca growers, collecting taxes from cocaine traffickers and defending both from security forces. **********The army field commander, Brig. Gen. Alberto Arciniega has been trying to root out the guerrillas but is steering clear of the growers and traffickers. Interfering with the growers, he says, would drive them into a closer alliance with the guerrillas. As for the traffickers, he says he does not have the strength to take on them and the guerrillas simultaneously. A Cocaine Boom Town **********United States officials say aircraft landing fees that the guerrillas have been collecting from traffickers, as well as payments from coca farmers, are being used to improve the cocaine boom town of Uchiza, where General Arciniega has his headquarters, and to buy food for the general's troops. **********Announcing his new anti-drug program on Sept. 5, President Bush said he was allocating $261 million for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, mostly for the military and the police. **********Colombia received $65 million in emergency military and police assistance shortly after President Virgilio Barco declared all-out war on drug traffickers in August. But the Bush Administration has made no special funding requests for Peru and Bolivia. **********The main coca-growing areas are crucial targets for reducing the flow of cocaine to the United States, American officials say. Yet one senior official here said, ''There are a good deal of misgivings among people in Washington, in both the executive branch and in Congress, as to whether you can effectively invest money in anti-drug programs in Peru.'' **********Neither Peru nor Bolivia, whose economies depend on income from the drug business, has done a great deal in the past to counter cocaine production, and both remain equivocal on how much effort they are willing to make. Both Governments say they want to reduce production and crude refining of coca, but both say the United States should place less emphasis on military and police action and more on economic programs aimed at getting farmers to voluntarily switch crops. Opposition to Herbicides **********Peru has halted the forced manual eradication of coca crops, and eradication efforts in Bolivia have slowed. American officials have been testing herbicides in Peru, but opposition to their use is running high. ''Who can guarantee that these chemicals will not ruin our fields forever?'' a senior Peruvian military officer asked. **********Both Peru and Bolivia are grappling with severe economic problems. President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia declared a state of emergency last month and jailed hundreds of union leaders and teachers who he said threatened his Government's anti-inflation policies with their wage demands. In Peru, the gross national product fell by 20 percent last year, and inflation is running at an annual rate of 2,500 percent. **********In the past, almost all of the anti-drug work in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia has been done by the police. The armed forces argue that their task is to guard against invasion and subversion, and some officers also worry that bribery by cocaine traffickers would corrupt their forces. **********But the Bush Administration wants to get the armed forces involved and is offering them the major share of its money for the region. In Peru, for example, $39 million is to go to the armed forces, $26 million to the police. **********The armed forces have started carrying out some anti-drug operations in Colombia, but most of the work there is still being done by the police. **********Senior Peruvian military officers say they plan to use the new United States money to intensify their campaign against the guerrillas and to try to prevent the smuggling of chemicals needed in the refining of cocaine. United States officials say they accept the Peruvian argument that the guerrillas must be attacked first, opening areas in which the police will be able to move against drug traffickers. **********But they are also trying to get the military to end their tolerance of the growers and traffickers and to cooperate with the police. ''It is enormously frustrating to all of us that things are going so slowly,'' an American official said. ''There is a sense of urgency in what we're trying to do. But that urgency and frustration are tempered by a desire to make real achievements and not just spend money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Stead", "pub_date": "1989-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** S.

George S. Patton's Third United States Army on April 11, 1945, and the lives of the remaining 20,000 inmates were saved. But before that happened, more than a quarter of a million people had been imprisoned in one of the most infamous of Hitler's places of death and torture. Most died - 65,000 here, and others in other camps. **********East Germany has made a national memorial of the former camp. But it does not commemorate the victims for what they were, and it denies to the United States recognition for having liberated Buchenwald. **********The Government exploits the ground consecrated by the ordeal of many - Jews, Poles, Russians, gypsies, prisoners of war and hostages from the occupied countries, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and Communists - for propaganda, in the same way that Poland makes use of Auschwitz. Anti-Semitism Unmentioned **********In the vocabulary of the authorities, the perpetrators were Fascists - who in the East German view exist only in West Germany - and the victims all anti-Fascists. Communists, particularly Germans, are the heroes who offered resistance. Specific tribute is paid to the suffering only of those whose countries later became allies of East Germany. **********Anti-Semitism is never mentioned, even on the only one of the many memorial stones that is devoted to Jews - the 10,000 Germans and Austrians dragged there after the pogrom of November 1938. No cross honors those martyred for their Christian faith; there is no Star of David. The number of Soviet prisoners of war slain - 8,483 - is given; so is that of victims of the death marches as the SS evacuated many of the prisoners in the last days. But nowhere is it said that those 22,500 were mainly Jews. **********On the memorial stones and in the museum in the building in which the SS once kept the camp's stores and the belongings it stole from its prisoners, the word ''Befreiung,'' or liberation, never appears. In a legend created after the fact, Buchenwald was ''selbstbefreit,'' or ''self-liberated.'' **********Elie Wiesel, the Nobel-Prize-winning author, who was liberated in Buchenwald, remembers differently. **********''The most moving moment of my life was the day the Americans arrived, a few hours after the SS had fled,'' he recalled in a telephone interview from his home in New York. ''It was the morning of April 11.'' **********''I will always remember with love a big black soldier,'' he went on. ''He was crying like a child -tears of all the pain in the world and all the rage. Every one who was there that day will forever feel a sentiment of gratitude to the American soldiers who liberated us.'' **********Mr. Wiesel recalled that the SS guards, estimated at 5,000 in the final stage, fled as American troops neared, and the clandestine Communist camp organization, which had long prepared for that day, took command for some hours before the Americans arrived. **********The United States Army, when it is mentioned at all, is never called the ''liberator'' but rather the ''occupation power.'' In the one reference to it in the museum, it is criticized. None of the many photographs on display show the liberating soldiers. **********In the summer of 1945, the American Army turned over a large area of central Germany to Soviet occupation, an act described in the literature distributed at the memorial as the ultimate liberation. **********Visitors are told that the Jews arrested in 1938 were largely wealthy; in fact, virtually all male German and Austrian Jews more than 16 years old - the poor outnumbered the rich by far - were thrown into camps. Visitors are also told that the goal of the roundup was to persuade Jews to leave Germany. After nearly six years of Nazi rule, they needed no persuasion. They would have left, and done so much earlier, had there been countries ready to receive them. Beginning to Recognize Jews **********Until lately, East Germany avoided discussion of that aspect of German history. Only since last November, the 50th anniversary of the pogrom, has its tightly controlled information and publishing machinery begun to take serious note of the history of German Jews and the fact that a few thousand Jews still live in this country. **********In the East Berlin synagogue on a recent Saturday, two men in their 40's and their sons in their late teens celebrated belated bar mitzvahs after even more belated circumcision. **********Peter Fischer, a party member who is a social scientist, holding his grandchild in his arms as he addressed the congregation after having been called to read from the Torah for the first time, explained his decision.

The November gain thus resulted almost entirely from the reduction in the earlier two months, and was therefore more illusory than real, preventing any outbreak of enthusiasm about the holiday sales period. **********''I don't read a lot of strength into these numbers,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''The image of the consumer is that they're not doing much.'' **********Tending to support this view was a separate report today from the nation's auto makers showing that sales of cars made in the United States fell 28 percent in the first 10 days of December from the 1988 period. Responding to Bargains **********Nevertheless, various analysts took some comfort from November's sales figures, which did at least suggest that consumers continue to spend when offered bargains. The rise, said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''may indicate that consumers are responding strongly to price discounts'' that have become prevalent in the Christmas shopping season. With incomes rising and inflation subdued, he said, ''fears of a poor Christmas season should abate with this report.'' **********This, in turn, suggested that the Federal Reserve may be a bit less eager to take its next step toward lower interest rates, a move that is still widely expected to occur in the wake of next week's meeting of its main policy-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee. **********The increase in November's sales embraced both durable goods -those expected to last at least three years - and nondurables, with drugstores the only category showing a decline. Durable Goods Up 0.7% **********Durable goods were up seven-tenths of 1 percent over all from the October level, as building materials climbed 2 percent, gains at auto dealers were five-tenths of 1 percent and sales at furniture stores rose 1.6 percent. **********Among nondurables, which rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, gains at general merchandise stores were seven-tenths of 1 percent; at food stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent; at both gasoline stations and eating and drinking places, nine-tenths of 1 percent, and at apparel stores, 2.4 percent. The decline at drugstores was one-tenth of 1 percent. **********All except furniture and food stores, however, posted sales declines in October, which is now shown to have suffered a 1.3 percent overall decline instead of the 1 percent drop initially estimated. **********September's advance was pared back by the Commerce Department today to three-tenths of 1 percent, from seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********Sales for November, at $144.56 billion, were actually slightly below the $145.29 billion now established for September, adjusted for seasonal and holiday differences but not for inflation. 'Still Rather Sluggish' **********Last month's sales were 3.6 percent above those of November 1988, but analysts noted that sales fell slightly in real terms - when adjusted for inflation - because consumer prices over the last year have risen by about 4.5 percent. **********''Retail sales this year are still rather sluggish,'' said Brian S. Wesbury of Stotler Economics, in Chicago, commenting on today's results. But he also said he took some comfort in the fact that the consumer could at least be enticed with price cuts. **********''It seems like everything in America is on sale,'' said Mr. Wesbury, who said he had expected discounted prices to erode retail sales in November but who now say lower prices served instead to enhance sales. **********If so, this suggests that consumers may have begun heavy holiday shopping earlier than usual this year, perhaps setting a pace that cannot be sustained and leading to December disappointment. A Sampling of 3,200 **********The department's survey of retail sales is based on 3,200 sampling units - retail chains, individual stores, restaurants, auto dealers - that supply their results by mail or phone. Many, however, base their bookkeeping on weekly intervals ending on Saturday, so for November the department had to estimate results for the final five days of the month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/28/world/goal-in-chile-fiscal-change-with-stability.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1989-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1063, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goal in Chile: Fiscal Change With Stability", "print_headline": "Goal in Chile: Fiscal Change With Stability", "body_text": " **********A recent newspaper cartoon here showed a group of South American presidents -from Brazil, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina - struggling not to drown in a sea of economic woes, while one man stood on the shore, undecided about jumping in. **********The man on the shore was Patricio Aylwin, the Christian Democrat leading a 17-party alliance who is a strong frontrunner in what will be Chile's first presidential elections in 19 years. On Dec. 14, voters will choose the successor to Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who lost his bid to retain power in a plebiscite last October. **********But despite the cartoon's suggestion that an Aylwin presidency might lead to hard times, economic advisers to Mr. Aylwin say the last thing they intend to do is damage the successful free-market economy fostered by the Pinochet Government. Responding to Pent-Up Demand **********''We are going to produce change with stability,'' promised Alejandro Foxley, who runs Mr. Aylwin's economic team and is expected to become Minister of Finance if he wins. **********Mr. Foxley, 50 years old, has a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin and is president of an economic research institute here and holder of an endowed chair in economics at the University of Notre Dame. **********The Aylwin economists say that a democratic government has to respond to pent-up demand for improvements in the lives of the poorer half of the population, and that to do this they will raise income and corporate taxes, as well as seek international aid. **********The Aylwin camp is conscious, however, of the economic instability afflicting most of South America, and of the economic traumas that were a major factor in the interruption in Chilean democracy 16 years ago, when the armed forces led by General Pinochet overthrew the Socialist President, Salvador Allende Gossens. Mr. Foxley says an Aylwin government would have no intention of changing the prevailing economic rules. Unity Is a Major Challenge **********''Democracy cannot totally frustrate the aspirations and hopes of people,'' he said. ''At the same time, we have a well-functioning economy and our task will be to maintain economic growth at 4 or 5 percent a year. We will have to increase social expenditures without increasing the fiscal deficit.'' **********One challenge to bringing this about is whether Socialists and Christian Democrats can work together, and whether the splintered Socialists can settle or control their own internal differences. **********The Christian Democrats and the Socialists were on opposite sides when the Allende Government went down in the midst of near-economic anarchy on Sept. 11, 1973. Much of the country was opposing factory and farm takeovers and other attempts at state control, shortages were widespread and annual inflation approached four digits. **********President Allende died in the presidential palace, which was under bombardment by the armed forces. His death was a suicide in the view of researchers and many of his fellow Socialists today, although many Allende supporters contended that he had been slain. Finding Common Ground **********Dr. Allende, whose Government was a coalition of Socialists, Communists and several smaller parties, had failed to get a majority of the popular vote in 1970 and became President only with the support of the Christian Democrats in the congressional runoff. **********But the Christian Democrats subsequently moved into open opposition to Dr. Allende, and some senior Christian Democrats, including Mr. Aylwin, appeared to support the coup. **********It has taken years of discussions and negotiations for the Christian Democrats and Socialists to find common ground in opposing General Pinochet and preparing a future government. **********At the same time, one Socialist faction, led by Ricardo Lagos, has moved toward social democracy. The other main faction, led by Clodomiro Almeyda, is officially Marxist-Leninist, but it has distanced itself from the Communist Party and says it has set aside its economic goals for now in the interest of achieving political democracy. **********''The Socialists in this country know they have to prove that they can govern without producing severe economic problems,'' said Mr. Foxley, a Christian Democrat, ''and they are willing to go along with moderate policies.'' 'Question of Survival' **********Sergio Bitar, who was Minister of Mining at the end of the Allende Government and spent 13 months as a political prisoner after the coup, says that for the Socialists much more than economic policy is now at stake. **********''For us, the imbalance of economic factors in the Allende period is related to pain and death, not just to the loss of votes,'' he said, ''because we know that the economy was a factor that facilitated the coup.'' **********''For us,'' he added, ''inflation is not a question of numbers. It's a question of survival.'' **********Mr. Bitar, a Harvard graduate who calls himself a ''pragmatic socialist,'' is considered a possible member of the future government. He has taken an active role with Mr. Foxley and others in convincing businessmen, bankers and foreign investors that democracy will not be bad for the economy. An Open, Low-Tariff Economy **********The economic team led by Mr. Foxley produced an outline of economic policy and principles that commits an Aylwin government to an open, low-tariff economy without price controls. **********It also suggests there will be more government direction of the economy, particularly to promote industrialization, than has been the practice of recent years. **********This has brought criticism from departing Government economists and some business leaders, who see it as statist in philosophy and think the increased corporate taxes will discourage investment. **********However, Fernando Leniz, an influential businessman who supports Mr. Aylwin's chief opponent, former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi, said he was not frightened by the Aylwin economic plan. **********Mr. Leniz said he was encouraged by the fact that ''for the first time in Chile both sides are offering an economic policy in a modern framework.'' **********He said that, on balance, the parameters of the debate over economic policy today in Chile seemed no broader than those ''between, say, Republicans and Democrats.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/world/dissident-defies-burmese-leaders.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISSIDENT DEFIES BURMESE LEADERS", "print_headline": "DISSIDENT DEFIES BURMESE LEADERS", "body_text": " **********In the first recent act of open defiance of the Burmese military Government, a dissident leader and former Prime Minister has refused to renounce a rebel government he formed during last year's national uprising, diplomats said today. **********The dissident leader, U Nu, defied an order by the governing military council to formally dissolve his 26-member Cabinet by today or face Government action, the diplomats said. **********''It looks as if U Nu and his party are in a stand-off against the Government here,'' a diplomat said. **********Mr. Nu, who was ousted as Prime Minister in a military coup more than a quarter century ago, told reporters Monday that the army had no authority over him or his parallel government. #1,000 Protesters Killed ''I have never considered these people with gun power as authorities who have the power to take criminal action against me,'' Mr. Nu said at his party's headquarters in Yangon, also called Rangoon.

May Study Overseas Role **********And in response to a question from an opposition member in Parliament last week, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he would like to ''begin studying the dispatching of the self-defense forces overseas for the purposes of international cooperation, fulfilling the protection of Japanese overseas'' - presumably in the case of disasters - ''and to contribute to keeping peace.'' **********Mr. Kaifu stopped short of committing himself, however, saying he wanted to consider ''the opinions of the general public and the discussions in Parliament.'' **********Major policy changes here often begin with such tentative hints, and Japan has long been criticized, in the United States and at home, for sitting idly by while enjoying the protection of others. **********No one has yet drafted wording to change the law that prevents the Self-Defense Force from overseas missions. But almost immediately some members of Mr. Kaifu's Cabinet began suggesting roles for the Japanese military abroad that no one was previously willing to discuss publicly. Need to Protect Plutonium **********The most critical of those missions may be protecting plutonium shipped to Japan for use in its nuclear power plants. Starting in 1992, plutonium extracted from spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed in Britain and France and must be shipped back to Japan. There are widespread fears, both in Japan and among American officials, that the vessels carrying the plutonium could be a prime target for terrorists. **********Picking up on Mr. Kaifu's comments, Juro Matsumoto, the director general of the Defense Agency, said the Japanese Navy might be used in convoys to protect the plutonium. Currently Japanese naval ships are limited to sailing no more than 1,000 miles from Japan, along its major sea lanes, so Japan has previously proposed sending unarmed ships from the Maritime Safety Agency, essentially a coast guard, to escort the plutonium ships. Officials acknowledged, however, that unarmed ships could be of little use against terrorists. **********In a rare breach of unity in the Government, the Foreign Ministry immediately issued a statement that appeared to contradict Mr. Matsumoto, saying that despite ''conflicting reports'' in the Government about sending Self-Defense Force units overseas, the Government's ''fundamental position has not changed.'' **********The contradictory statements appeared to reflect a wide split in the Government over the issue. ''There are many, many views, and they are slowly coming into clear conflict,'' a senior official said Friday. ''It's getting increasingly difficult to make a contribution to the world when you can't even be a U.N. peacekeeper.'' Issue Last Raised on Mideast **********The last time the issue came up seriously was two years ago, when Japan came under pressure to contribute to the pretection of oil shipments coming from the Middle East. **********The Prime Minister at the time, Yasuhiro Nakasone, argued that nothing in the Japanese Constitution bars the Self-Defense Force units from going abroad. But he also said he would not order minesweepers to the gulf because of the risk that they could become involved in combat. **********The issue is likely to become a major point of contention between Mr. Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties, which are squaring off for an election early next year that will decide who controls the powerful lower house of the Parliament. Opposition members gained control of the upper house for the first time in three decades this summer, after the Liberal Democrats were rocked by scandal. **********Traditionally, the Socialist Party has strongly refused to go along with any plan for overseas military operations, and at times has questioned the legality of having a Self-Defense Force at all.

Each Could Approve **********Under rules being studied by the Treasury Department, each agency could approve any hybrid proposed by an exchange under its authority, the Government officials said. That would mean, for example, that the securities commission could approve a product that had the features of a futures contract as long as it was proposed by a stock exchange. **********The current jurisdictional debate was sparked by a new financial instrument called an index participation, which was proposed by two stock exchanges but is being fought in court by the futures industry. With such a product, an investor could purchase the equivalent of a basket of stocks based on an index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But, like a future, there is no delivery of stocks underlying the index. **********The proposal would revise the Commodity Exchange Act, which governs the legislative authority of the futures agency. The proposal would amend what is known as the ''exclusivity clause'' of the law, which grants the futures commission the sole right to regulate products that are futures. **********As a result of the change, the nation's stock exchanges could begin to trade products that have significant features of a futures contract, while the futures exchanges could trade products that are like a security. Competition on Hybrids **********This would mean that the stock exchanges and the futures exchanges could be in direct competition on all hybrid products developed from now on, Government officials and industry executives said. Some officials said they believed this would promote further development of financial products on United States stock and futures exchanges. **********''The system with the laws as now interpeted is highly anti-competitive,'' a Government official with working knowledge of the plan said. ''What you need to develop is an incentive toward competition.'' **********Treasury officials said yesterday that in addition to that proposal, the department was considering allowing the jurisdictional issue to be resolved in court, or seeking an agreement between the two regulatory bodies about their responsibilities. Response to Court Ruling **********The proposed changes were developed by Administration officials in response to a recent decision by a Federal appeals court in Chicago that the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange could not trade new instruments that had features of a futures contract. **********Those instruments, such as the index participations, were approved by the S.E.C., but the Chicago court ruled that the commission was wrong when it decided that the product was a security and not a futures contract. The commission is now deciding whether to challenge the Chicago ruling in the Supreme Court. **********However, if the proposals being examined by the Treasury are adopted as law, the securities commission would not have to seek a judicial remedy because the rule change would grant the commission the authority to approve the product because it was proposed by stock exchanges. **********Some Government officials recently have been publicly supporting proposals that would expand the authority of the two regulators in order to prevent the judicial squabbles, as in the case of the index participation matter. **********Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the S.E.C., voiced his support on Saturday for such a measure at a conference in Florida of securities industry officials. He did not say that such a proposal was already under consideration at the Treasury. Marketplace Test Urged **********''It doesn't do this country any good when it develops a new product, but then, instead of going to the marketplace, we have to go to the courthouse,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''The marketplace ought to be where we test them.'' **********But Treasury officials said yesterday that legislative solutions to the problem would be difficult because of the entrenched interests of the securities and futures industries. ''In the past, there has been no political will to make these decisions,'' a Treasury official said. **********The industry became caught in the jurisdictional tangles beginning in 1981, when the securities commission and the futures agency were on opposite sides of a lawsuit brought by the nation's major futures exchanges against a Chicago Board Options Exchange proposal to trade in Ginnie Mae options, which are based on Government National Mortgage Association certificates. **********While the case was won by the futures exchanges, there were rumblings of possible action by Congress. As a result, the chairmen of the two regulatory bodies agreed in the so-called Shad-Johnson accord to rules that divided up their regulatory responsibilities giving the securities commission jurisdiction over options on financial instruments and the futures agency control over futures. **********Some Government officials and industry executives said yesterday that the Shad-Johnson accord had failed because it did not take into account further innovations in financial products that occurred after the agreement was reached."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/07/business/jaguar-sales-up-in-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jaguar Sales Up in U.S.", "print_headline": "Jaguar Sales Up in U.S.", "body_text": " **********Jaguar Cars Inc., the United States subsidiary of Britain's Jaguar P.L.C., said today that its total sales for January were 1,492 units, up 28 percent from the 1,168 units sold a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/01/business/fda-drug-approval-due.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.D..A.

The Government reported yesterday that the index of leading economic indicators in May fell 1.2 percent, its biggest decline since the stock market crash of October 1987. The index rose six-tenths of 1 percent in April. Other Signs of Weakness **********''There are many other indicators that point to a worsening of the economy,'' said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''There are also signals that the Federal Reserve is getting worried about the seriousness of the economic decline. Consequently, we believe it is only a matter of days before the Fed allows short-term rates to fall substantially below current levels.'' **********Jonathan B. Greenspan, chief trader at Aegis Capital Management, noted that the bond futures and cash markets had behaved unusually. **********''In Chicago, the selling was sparked by the failure of the spot September bond futures to respond to the good news and break through a new spot contract high,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''But the spot September contract only rose 5/32, to 97.00. The contact's high, set June 12, was 97.25. In the cash Treasury securities market in New York, other factors added to the pressure on prices.'' Thin Pool of Buyers **********For one, many traders had expected a surge of buying after the leading indicators report was released and those who had planned to take profits at that time placed their sell orders yesterday, he said. **********''Others sold because we are headed into a holiday period, when the market becomes relatively illiquid,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''Also, whatever buying there was for dressing quarerly and first-half portfolios was already done.'' **********With the Treasury debt market heavily long, many of the sell orders fell into gaps between buy orders, Mr. Greenspan said, adding that the relatively few traders with short positions provided a thin pool of potential buyers. Usually, price declines prompt those who have sold short to buy out of their positions, thus cushioning a decline.

The long Treasury notes, the 9 1/8s of 1999, dropped 15/32, at 106 15/32, as the yield rose to 8.15 percent from 8.09 percent. **********Meanwhile, the Treasury's auction of $7.5 billion of 8 1/8 percent four-year notes was not received as well as the Tuesday sale of $8.75 billion of 8 1/4 percent two-year notes. The average yield produced by the sale was 8.19 percent, the lowest since March 1988, when the average yield was 7.90 percent. At the last sale of four-year notes, on March 29, the average yield was 9.70 percent. **********The new two-year notes traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.23 percent, off 3 basis points from the average yield produced by the auction. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. Dealers said Japanese investors again took up roughly 10 percent of the two-year notes. **********The Federal Reserve moved to add $1.5 billion of reserves indirectly to the banking system by way of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which banks charge each other for overnight loans and which are extremely sensitive to the Fed's money market operations, were trading at 9 9/16 percent at the time of the Fed's action.

''Current inflation rates, by that criterion, clearly are too high and must be brought down.'' **********The financial markets responded favorably to his anti-inflation stance.

[ Page D1. ] Zero Is Not the Target **********It was not clear whether Mr. Greenspan had any motive other than to dispel the ''notion I hear all too frequently'' that the Federal Reserve considers today's inflation rates satisfactory. **********He did not specify what level he would find acceptable, although he left his audience with the impression that it would be higher than zero. Zero inflation was the target often mentioned by Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker. **********At the same time, Mr. Greenspan observed that prices ''accelerated only slightly'' during the nation's strong economic growth in 1987 and 1988. That comment suggested that the Federal Reserve would not intensify the anti-inflation efforts already under way but would stick with its efforts to bring about ''stable'' prices in the long run. **********To counter inflation, the Federal Reserve has pushed short-term rates steadily higher since March in an effort to restrain an economy that, after allowing for the drought, grew by 3 percent or more during 1988. That level is somewhat higher than the central bank believes can be sustained without aggravating inflation pressures. The Government will publish its first estimate of fourth-quarter growth on Friday. **********By most measures, including the Consumer Price Index, inflation is running at about 4.5 percent a year. **********The rise in short-term rates, however, has been accompanied by a welcome stability in long-term rates, suggesting that the Fed has achieved widespread credibility as an inflation-fighter. **********That may explain, in part, why the stock market rallied. The stock and credit markets are in competition for investors' money, and the prospect of long-term stability in rates could make stocks more attractive. **********The painful side of the Federal Reserve's restrictive policy is that consumers will be increasingly pinched by interest costs, diminishing their ability to make purchases. And if this occurs too suddenly the economy could tip into recession. **********That would lead to an assault on the Federal budget deficit, as tax receipts shrink while unemployment outlays and other government costs rise. **********Usually the yields of short-term and long-term rates diverge, as investors demand higher rates for more distant maturities. But 30-year Treasury bonds now yield no more than those coming due in a few months. Inflation Pressure **********Mr. Greenspan expressed satisfaction with this situation in a speech Monday to a home builders' group in Atlanta. **********While Mr. Greenspan was making his nearly three-hour appearance before the House committee, the Labor Department reported that its Employment Cost Index continued to reflect inflation pressure. **********The index, compiled quarterly, showed that total compensation costs for civilian workers climbed 5 percent for the 12 months through December, up from 4.7 percent for the 12 months through September and from 3.6 percent a year ago. **********Wages and salaries in the private sector, a widely watched barometer, rose by 4.1 percent in the latest 12 months, the biggest increase in three years. **********Among groups with the heftiest rises were workers in health care, retail trade and real estate. **********Felicia Nathan, a Labor Department economist, said there appeared to be no grounds for alarm in the figures. **********''I would still call it moderate,'' she said of the rise, noting that unlike 1988 there was no rise this year in the rate of the Social Security payroll tax, now 7.51 percent. **********Under questioning by members of the Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan made several observations about the economy: *********** That improvement in the nation's trade deficit seems to have stalled, but this was probably only a temporary pause. *********** That he was so discouraged by the nation's low savings rate that perhaps the only effective remedy would be for the Government to force it higher by running a surplus in the Federal budget. *********** That ''if all else fails'' he would prefer the draconian budget cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law to giving up the discipline of the law itself. *********** That he much preferred a gasoline tax to an oil-import fee because most gasoline is consumed directly and thus an additional levy does not become embedded in the cost structure of the petrochemical and other oil-consuming industries. *********** That Government outlays in support of the thrift industry would have little additional effect on interest rates because the markets have already built this into their calculations. *********** That he would prefer ''all or virtually all'' of whatever deficit reduction can be accomplished to come from lower spending rather than higher taxes. *********** That the capital requirement imposed on banks should ultimately be extended to savings institutions as well. *********** That the Reagan Administration's budget projections were achievable only in the unlikely event that the entire budget was promptly enacted. *********** That new securities powers for banks that the Federal Reserve approved last week would have occurred automatically had it not acted. **********In another report, the Commerce Department said an above-average increase in the rate of growth in factory payrolls in the Southwest and Plains regions and below-average growth in payrolls in New England and the Southeast had helped reduce disparities in personal income growth rates between coastal and interior regions during the 12 months that ended in September 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/04/business/dow-finishes-down-2.05-to-2629.51.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1989-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Finishes Down 2.05, to 2,629.51", "print_headline": "Dow Finishes Down 2.05, to 2,629.51", "body_text": " **********Stocks slipped yesterday, partly on a report of a larger-than-expected rise in nonfarm employment. **********At the same time, the recent volatility in the market seemed to be stifled by curbs on program trading, disappointing corporate earnings and uncertainty about the direction of the economy. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up by about 10 points when trading opened, marked time through most of the day to finish 2.05 points lower, at 2,629.51.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, today wound up a celebration of 20 years of what the official press agency called ''the greatest revolution ever waged.'' **********But the three days of razzmatazz, with a cost that has been estimated at $300 million, registered no apparent major new gains for what diplomats call a drive by Colonel Qaddafi to end years of isolation. **********The 47-year-old leader, who took power in a coup on Sept. 1, 1969, has moved recently to befriend neighbors and seek bridges to the West, particularly in Europe. But the celebrations revealed uncertain relations with King Hassan of Morocco that could jeopardize the newly created Arab Maghreb Union. They also revealed ambiguous European attitudes toward the Libyan leader and a continued and chilly distance between him and the mainstream of Arab diplomacy. **********According to some Palestinian and Western officials, Colonel Qaddafi has moved to greatly reduce, if not sever, his support for Damascus-based Palestinian movements, including followers of Ahmed Jabril suspected of involvement in downing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December. But many Western governments, including the United States, remain wary of the depth of his commitment to withdraw support from terror groups and thus maintain embargoes and sanctions imposed years ago. Sponsored Many Groups **********In the past, Colonel Qaddafi sponsored many groups regarded in the West as terrorists, including the West German Red Army Faction, the Irish Republican Army and dissident Palestinian groups such as those led by Abu Nidal - the nom de guerre of Sabry al-Banna - and Mr. Jabril, both suspected or accused of major acts of terror. **********In 1986 West European governments imposed sanctions on Libya after the bombing of a discotheque used by American personnel in West Berlin. Britain had broken relations with Colonel Qaddafi's Government after the shooting of a British policewoman in London outside the Libyan mission in 1984. **********European attitudes remain ambiguous, fractured by competing perceptions of national interest. France and Italy, with strong economic interests here, have eased the restrictions, which include avoding high-level visits to Libya. But Britain and the Netherlands say they have seen no hard evidence that Colonel Qaddafi has changed his policies. **********In an effort to assuage the British, Colonel Qaddafi has sent messages to his missions abroad saying that Libya does not support violence by the I.R.A. in Northern Ireland, Western diplomats said, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remains unconvinced. She did not reply to an invitation to the weekend's celebrations, diplomats said. At the same time, Western diplomats said, Colonel Qaddafi has withdrawn support for West German guerrillas. **********Last month, Western diplomats said, Colonel Qaddafi summoned representatives of what one envoy called ''70 so-called liberation movements'' and ''told them they had to close up shop here and if they wanted financial assistance it would be provided through official channels outside Libya.'' Will Still Support Some **********The identity of those movements remained unclear, and Colonel Qaddafi said in a speech on Friday that he would continue support for groups in several countries, including South Africa and the Israeli-occupied territories. **********Diplomats and Palestinian officials said that three months ago, Colonel Qaddafi told groups led by Mr. Jabril and Col. Saed Musa, both opposed to Mr. Arafat, that direct funding to them would be reduced or ended. They were also urged to close their offices here. **********Libya has reportedly told those groups that all aid to Palestinians will be channeled through the Palestine Liberation Organization office here, but other reports suggest that the Libyan leader has reserved the overwhelming bulk of financial support to Palestinians for the underground leadership of the uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Some diplomats and analysts here trace Colonel Qaddafi's decision to lessen his isolation to the United States bombing raid on Tripoli in April, 1986, which one Western diplomat said ''showed his vulnerability.'' **********''The raid misfired in one way because the people rallied to Qaddafi,'' the diplomat, who requested anonymity, said, ''but it also showed him that expansionist policies had a personal price tag for him. And he realized his army could not protect him. The psychological impact was deep.'' Oil Prices and Chad Defeat **********At the same time, however, Libya's four million people were registering increased discontent as the bounties of high oil prices disappeared and the store shelves became bare. Colonel Qaddafi's army, meanwhile, remained bogged down and facing defeat in an unpopular war in Chad that left few families untouched and his isolation near-total. **********''His ideology is not so dominant that he cannot see that things have gone wrong,'' the diplomat said. **********Colonel Qaddafi shifted course and restored ties with neighboring Tunisia and Algeria. Opening the border with Tunisia, his neighbor to the west, residents said, he simply took the expedient step of clambering aboard a bulldozer and flattening the customs and immigrations posts so that now there is no formal frontier on the Libyan side. **********In February he joined Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco in forming the Maghreb Union, which is supposed to create an economic group, in part to respond to the prospect of a single European market in 1992. But there other motives, too. **********''The Tunisians and Algerians have an interest in trying to lock Qaddafi into the grouping rather than leave him isolated outside of it, where he might cause trouble,'' an Arab diplomat in the region said. ''And they want some of Libya's money, too.'' Meeting With Mubarak **********Then, in June, Col. Qaddafi met with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to launch a reconciliation with Egypt after a decade of hostility. On Friday, Libya signed a peace treaty with Chad. And despite his aversion to the avowed moderation of the P.L.O., he seated its Chairman, Yasir Arafat, prominently at the celebrations here this weekend. **********But his initiatives seem blocked by personal and ideological differences with other Arabs, including King Hassan and Mr. Arafat. **********''The situation is now very critical, because Qaddafi has not decided which way to go - in favor of Arafat or in favor of Arafat's opponents,'' an Arab official said. The debate touches the core of Western Europe's ambiguous approach to Colonel Qaddafi, too."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/13/world/bush-nominee-is-quizzed-over-illicit-contra-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 982, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Nominee Is Quizzed Over Illicit Contra Aid", "print_headline": "Bush Nominee Is Quizzed Over Illicit Contra Aid", "body_text": " **********A former senior aide to George Bush ran into fierce opposition today as he tried to convince Democratic senators that neither he nor Mr. Bush knew about the Reagan Administration's clandestine program to arm the Nicaraguan contras until late 1986. **********Partisan passions flared as the Democrats presented evidence repeatedly contradicting testimony of the former aide, Donald P. Gregg, who was Mr. Bush's national security adviser from 1982 through 1988. President Bush has nominated him to be the United States Ambassador to South Korea. **********At a hearing on the nomination before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Gregg offered a new explanation for a document saying Mr. Bush attended a meeting on ''resupply of the contras'' at a time when such aid was prohibited by law. Puts Blame on Secretary **********Mr. Gregg said that his secretary erred and that the meeting, on May 1, 1986, was actually about ''resupply of the copters'' - that is, the delivery of American helicopters to the Salvadoran Air Force for use in bombing leftist guerrillas. There was no discussion of sending arms to the contras, he contended. This explanation and others by Mr. Gregg drew a skeptical response from Democrats at the hearing. **********Besieged with questions, Mr. Gregg never lost his temper or his composure. But at times he appeared to be startled by documents suggesting that he knew about the Reagan Administration's program to arm the contras much earlier than he has acknowledged. **********It is not clear if the Senate will approve Mr. Gregg's nomination. The committee adjourned today without deciding whether to hold additional hearings on the nomination. **********During the hearing, Mr. Gregg explicitly contradicted prior testimony by Oliver L. North; by Gen. Paul F. Gorman, a former commander of United States military forces in Latin America, and by Mr. Gregg's secretary, Phyllis Byrne. As an aide to the National Security Council, Mr. North coordinated assistance for the contras. He was convicted this month of three crimes arising from his role in the scandal. Asserts He Knew 'Nothing' **********Mr. Gregg said today, as he has in the past, that he knew ''nothing about resupply of the contras'' until Aug. 8, 1986, when Mr. Gregg met at the White House with a friend, Felix Rodriguez, a former C.I.A. agent who was arranging the aerial delivery of weapons to the contras. Even then, Mr. Gregg said, he did not discuss the subject with Mr. Bush, who was Vice President at the time. **********Mr. Bush ''was interested in the contras as an instrument for putting pressure on the Sandinistas,'' Mr. Gregg said. But he testified that he and Mr. Bush never discussed ''the intricacies, or who was supplying what to whom.'' **********Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, dispensed with the usual courtesies and opened the hearing with an attack on Mr. Gregg. He said it appeared that Mr. Gregg had ''systematically misled'' members of Congress ''in order to cover up the truth and and to limit embarrassment'' to Mr. Bush. Mr. Cranston, the majority whip, said that he and ''nearly a dozen other senators'' had urged Mr. Bush to withdraw the nomination. 'Bush Is the Target' **********Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said that the Democrats were conducting ''an inquisition'' and were milking the Iran-contra affair for political gain. He told the witness that ''George Bush is the target this morning, not you, Mr. Gregg.'' **********Democrats asserted that Mr. Gregg was in a quandary. Either he knew about the contra-supply network and perjured himself, they said, or he did not know and had been grossly negligent. On this point, Mr. Gregg said, ''If I cannot convince this Senate committee that I have been telling the truth, I don't deserve to be confirmed.'' **********Mr. Gregg, a C.I.A. agent for 32 years, said that Mr. Bush did not know of Mr. Rodriguez's role in the arms-supply network until he learned about it from an article in The New York Times on Dec. 13, 1986. The article was based on an interview with Mr. Gregg. **********Mr. Cranston said the evidence suggested that Mr. Gregg and others in the White House had tried to ''secure military aid for the contras through unorthodox channels.'' **********''Your career training in establishing secrecy and deniability for covert operations and your decades-old friendship with Felix Rodriguez apparently led you to believe that you could serve the national interest by sponsoring a freelance operation out of the Vice President's office,'' Mr. Cranston said.  MANY DOUBT BUSH, POLL SHOWS **********More Americans than ever before say that they think President Bush is concealing something important about the Iran-contra scandal, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. **********Sixty-four percent of the 1,073 adults polled said Mr. Bush was ''hiding something that the public ought to know,'' while 23 percent said he was not. That was up sharply from a January Times/CBS News Poll, just before his inauguration and the beginning of the trial of Oliver L. North. At that time, 48 percent said he was hiding something the public should know, and 39 percent said he was not. **********Fifty-one percent of the respondents to the telephone poll, conducted on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, said they thought Mr. Bush should pardon Mr. North, who was convicted last week on charges of destroying documents, preparing a false chronology of Iranian arms sales and accepting a free home-security system. **********Forty-two percent said Mr. North should not be pardoned.

Chief Defines Goals", "body_text": " **********In his first public discussion of the future policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission since he took office as chairman two weeks ago, Richard C. Breeden sent reassuring signals to the markets today, saying that his agency would not press Congress to grant the commission power to close the nation's securities markets in times of crisis. **********''Circuit breakers'' put in place after the stock market crash of 1987, which require temporary trading halts if the market drops a certain amount, had diminished the need for the S.E.C. to be given summary authority to close down trading, he said. **********''Moreover, my personal view is that a decision of that economic consequence should not be made by the commission alone,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''It should ultimately be a decision the President makes.'' Would Support Registration **********In a broad-ranging interview about how he plans to conduct the business of the agency that regulates Wall Street, Mr. Breeden outlined an agenda that could both increase the agency's reach in some areas while checking its influence in others. **********Reflecting the thinking of his mentor, President Bush, he said: ''We want to be a fair cop. But we also want to be a tough cop.'' **********For example, he said he would strongly support any initiatives that require banks and savings and loan associations that issue stock and other securities to the public to register with the S.E.C., a measure that would bring thousands of financial institutions under the regulation of the commission. The issue has been debated in Congress, but there has been no legislation. **********But at the same time, he said he was not prepared to continue the fight of his predecessor, David S. Ruder, to wrest regulation of stock-index futures from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. **********And, in addressing the recent volatility in the market - stock prices gyrated wildly today alone - and fears raised in Congress and in the investment community about the proliferation of leveraged buyouts and corporate takeovers, he declined to take a strong position. A Difficult First Day **********''I don't know what the right level is,'' he said, referring to takeover activity. ''The marketplace should decide those questions.'' **********For the 39-year-old former assistant to the President for issues analysis in the Bush White House and main architect of the savings and loan bailout, Mr. Breeden's first two weeks on the job have been a period of intensive training. Sworn in on Oct. 11, his first day at work was Oct. 12, but a security guard at first refused to let him into his office because he did not have a pass. **********The next day, Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden did not have any trouble getting into his office, but the stock market tumbled, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling nearly 200 points. The day was chaotic, he said, because he was unfamiliar with the telephone system and did not have a computer terminal in his office. ''People had to run out and run back in to give me stock quotes.'' he said. **********But in general, he expressed confidence that the market systems put into place since the Dow plunged 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, had worked well so that orders were not backed up and investors got accurate price information. Few Changes Outlined **********''There is a perception that there were no changes, and that is erroneous,'' he said. ''A great deal was done.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Breeden outlined plans for very few changes in the market beyond those that the agency has already submitted to Congress, such as requiring brokerage firms to report large trades by their major customers and permitting the S.E.C. to get information on the financial condition of affiliates of broker dealers. **********He said even though the commission had requested authority from Congress last January to shut down the securities markets without the President's intervention, the consensus of current commissioners was that such a dramatic new level of power was not needed and that effort would be abandoned. **********But Mr. Breeden is not expected to tread lightly when it comes to advocating new policy initiatives that he feels are needed. Savings and Loan Losses **********He said today that he would strongly support any effort to force banks and savings institutions to register their securities with the S.E.C., adding that if savings and loan associations had been forced to use generally accepted accounting principles in the 1980's, the huge losses at the savings institutions would have been discovered much sooner and at a lower cost to the taxpayer. **********And he said that he would strongly support dramatic changes in Federal laws that currently prohibit banks from owning securities firms and vice versa to make United States firms competitive with European financial institutions. **********Though Mr. Breeden did not seem to be overly concerned about the market's ability to deal with wide swings in prices because of computerized trading, he said he was worried about the confidence of the small investor. **********He said that even though the level of volatility in the market had greatly increased, stock prices in general had risen strongly in recent years. Concern for Small Investor **********Pulling out a chart he had asked his staff to prepare for testimony he is scheduled to give on Wednesday to a House subcommittee, he noted that if an investor had bought the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average in January 1987, the value of those holdings as of Monday would be up more than 40 percent, despite the market's volatility over those 34 months. **********''While people focus on the volatility that exists in some of the short-term trading,'' he said, ''I would not like to have a situation in which people who are saving for college education or for retirement read about volatility in the markets and get scared away.'' **********He acknowledged that a key to maintaining small-investor confidence in the markets was to insure that the public perceived the S.E.C. as effectively enforcing the securities laws. **********While promising to be a ''tough cop,'' Mr. Breeden refrained from outlining a specific enforcement agenda, saying he would present an outline of his thinking at a later date. ''The commission's record is generally a good one and I want to see it stay that way,'' he said. Salaries Not Competitive **********But he said that the agency does have an Achilles' heel - insufficient staffing levels and pay scales so low that it has had problems keeping talented lawyers. **********''I've already got problems trying to compete for graduates of law schools,'' he said, because the S.E.C. can only offer ''$27,000 versus $82,000 by a Wall Street law firm.'' **********And he acknowledged that the savings and loan bailout law, which he had a big hand in devising, has only made that problem worse. **********Under that law, all Goverment banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration are exempt from Government pay caps and can begin to offer competitive salaries. But the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C., he said, were still under the salary restrictions, which has led to the agency losing as many as a third of its lawyers in a single year and experiencing a turnover rate double that of the other agencies. **********''I think that over the long run we will have a very significant problem in maintaining the traditional excellence of the commission staff if we are not able to be competitive even with other Government agencies, much less the private sector,'' he said. **********''It can really effect litigation if you end up having to change your lawyers on the case every 18 months.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/03/business/standstill-pact-reached-on-nwa-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1989-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Standstill Pact Reached On NWA Bid", "print_headline": "Standstill Pact Reached On NWA Bid", "body_text": " **********Marvin Davis and NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, agreed today to a two-month standstill accord in Mr. Davis's effort to acquire the St. Paul-based company. **********Mr. Davis agreed to stop soliciting shareholder votes before NWA's annual meeting on May 15, at which he was expected to try to gain control of the board. He also agreed to put off until June 30 buying NWA shares under his cash tender offer. **********A spokeswoman for Mr. Davis said he had concluded that he did not have enough time to wage an effective contest. On March 30, Mr. Davis offered $90 a share in cash, or $2.62 billion, for the company.

The bill totaled $71, but no one item cost more than $4.98. ''I shop here whenever I can,'' the hospital worker said, looking over her purchases. ''These are good buys, right?'' **********The thrill of finding a bargain is the big draw at the Pic 'N' Save Corporation's 172 stores that are mainly in the West and Southwest. In the Middle West, the Consolidated Stores Corporation's 328 Big Lots and Odd Lots outlets offer shoppers similar opportunities. More Than Half of Sector **********The two publicly held chains account for more than 50 percent of the fast-growing closeout sector of retailing, where shoppers buy the odds, ends, unwanteds and leftovers of manufacturers, wholesalers and importers. **********Both Consolidated, which had sales of $625 million last year, and Pic 'N' Save, with sales of $400 million, are pursuing ambitious plans to add stores and expand into new regions. But growth can come at a stiff price: Both companies have had trouble controlling their costs, and this could present more difficulties as the stores proliferate. **********Pic 'N' Save, based in Carson, Calif., just south of Los Angeles, has been moving steadily eastward for several years across Texas to New Orleans, where a new distribution hub is under construction. As part of the company's long-range plan to march up the East Coast with 30 to 40 new stores a year, Pic 'N' Save purchased 15 Job Lot Pushcart outlets in New York last December. They likely will be converted to Pic 'N' Save stores. **********The expansion has had a stifling effect on earnings growth, and this worries analysts. ''Sales at the new stores are below average, the expenses are above average and that's had a very negative effect on margins,'' said John Weiss, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. ''It's not clear when we'll see meaningful profits.'' **********Still, the gross profit margin is over 50 percent for Pic 'N' Save - among the highest for United States retailers. Consolidated's gross margin is 42 percent, still well above the average of 30 percent for discount stores and 38 percent for department stores. **********Pic 'N' Save says its expansion is ''essentially on track'' and more robust earnings should return by the end of the year after the new stores have been open for a while. In the second quarter, the company, which went public in 1971, earned $6.4 million on sales of $101.7 million. That is down from the earnings a year earlier of $8.1 million on sales of $82.9 million. **********Consolidated, from its base in Columbus, Ohio, operates stores in 13 Middle Western states from Michigan to Alabama. While Pic 'N' Save has developed a specialty selling clothing, Consolidated has a strong business in items like telephones, calculators and leaf blowers. Earnings Plunged Last Year **********Consolidated, once strictly a wholesaler, opened its first retail outlet in 1982 and has grown at a fast pace, opening 280 stores in less than five years. That growth spurt nearly wrecked the chain. Earnings in 1988 plunged by 33 percent, to $12.9 million from $19.5 million. **********''They were a victim of their own size,'' said James M. Guinan, the chairman of Consolidated and a long-time discount retailing executive brought in to shore up the company. ''They didn't have the systems and people and capacity to handle it.'' **********Some troubles persist. Sales this spring and summer have been surprisingly anemic, with revenue in established stores down 10.6 percent. And the company is still coping with its heavy expansion expenses. It invested $15 million to $20 million hiring nearly three dozen executives and updating computerization and distribution. In the second quarter, Consolidated broke even on sales of $133 million, compared with earnings a year before of $3.2 million on sales of $136.2 million. Going Ahead With Expansion **********Despite its weak recent earnings performance, Consolidated is going ahead with expansion plans in western New York, northern Illinois and the Southeast. The company, which predicts it will be profitable for the year, will open 30 more stores this year and plans 50 openings in 1990. **********Later this year, Pic 'N' Save and Consolidated will probably square off for the first time, when both enter the Atlanta market. **********The two companies even spoke briefly, though informally, several months ago about a merger deal. And no wonder. They operate in remarkably similar fashion. **********Buying departments at the two companies scour the country, and indeed the world, for manufacturer overruns and discontinued merchandise, though they do not buy irregulars. The merchandise is bought cheap, often at 5 cents to 15 cents on the dollar, and then priced at deep discount, many times 40 percent to 70 percent off retail. Clean but Rather Spartan **********Most of the stores are clean but rather spartan, with shelves often looking disorganized from all the rummaging consumers do in search of the last $1.98 pair of Burlington pantyhose at Pic 'N' Save (retail price: $5) and $59.99 General Electric cordless phones at Consolidated (retail: $119.95). Particularly around Christmas an entire store's merchandise can be wiped away, then replenished with a completely different set of goods in a few days. **********The chains buy in huge quantities, but because the goods are leftovers they can never reorder. As a result, shoppers have learned to stop in two or three times a month to see what the latest truckloads offer. **********At Pic 'N' Save in California, many shoppers are immigrants with little spare cash. In other areas, particularly Texas, the stores draw many customers who are simply facing tough economic times. For Consolidated, the mainstay shoppers are blue-collar workers with household incomes of $15,000 to $18,000. 'Rich Man Loves a Bargain' **********But it is not only struggling consumers who shop the chains. ''The poor man needs a bargain, the rich man loves a bargain,'' said Lewis B. Merrifield 3d, Pic 'N' Save's president and chief executive. ''It's my favorite phrase.'' **********Mr. Guinan of Consolidatedsaid he knew one Columbus bank president and avid tool buyer who stopped off most Saturday mornings. And in California, Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars can be seen outside Pic 'N' Save stores in West Los Angeles and the affluent suburban area of La Canada and La Crescenta. **********The frenzy in the aisles is duplicated in the headquarters of both Pic 'N' Save and Consolidated, where company buyers jump at a moment's notice to buy huge shipments from manufacturers and have them shipped to warehouses where they either are transferred directly to stores or sit for months until the proper selling season. Gamble on Halloween Candy **********Pic 'N' Save's chief buyer, Steven Miral, gambled and won on excess Halloween candy, bought at 90 percent off 10 days before the holiday. The candy arrived in Pic 'N' Save stores with six days to go and customers bought it all. In another coup, Mr. Miral bought 60 tractor-trailers filled with comforters from Fieldcrest when it merged two North Carolina factories and did not want to transfer the goods. Shoppers found $60 comforters at $34.95. **********He did not do as well with Slushmucks, yellow containers used to make ice treats. No one wanted them. ''It was the super dog of all time,'' Mr. Miral said.  ''We buy at a price in which we build in our holding charges and the cost of money and then we generate our normal gross margins,'' he added. Rise in Earnings Predicted **********Those margins translate into a predictable stream of net profits. Eliot S. Laurence, an analyst with Wessels, Arnold & Henderson in Minneapolis, predicts that Pic 'N' Save's earnings per share will rise to $1.80 by next year from $1.24 last year. **********''As you get past the initial stages of expansion, we'll see a return to good earnings growth for Pic 'N' Save,'' he said. The analyst is less optimistic about Consolidated. He does not recommend the stock to his clients because the price has been padded by the merger talk with Pic 'N' Save. **********Mr. Guinan is quick to admit that Pic 'N' Save operates more efficiently than Consolidated, in part because its distribution and warehouse operation is more highly computerized. But he adds, ''We still think fall is going to be very good, and we'll beat our 50-cent earnings per share from last year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/26/business/company-news-smithkline-president-quits-over-differences-with-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1989-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 706, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SmithKline President Quits Over Differences With Chief", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SmithKline President Quits Over Differences With Chief", "body_text": " **********The president and chief operating officer of the SmithKline Beckman Corporation abruptly resigned yesterday because of policy differences with the company's chief executive, both men said. **********''Yes, indeed there were policy differences that very much affect this business,'' George W. Ebright, the 50-year-old departing president, said in a telephone interview. ''I didn't feel in my good conscience I wanted to implement policies with which I didn't have full agreement.'' 'Have Had Differences' **********Neither he nor Henry Wendt, the company's chairman and chief executive, would elaborate. **********''George and I have had differences on matters of corporate policy,'' Mr. Wendt said in a prepared statement. ''Nevertheless, I accept his resignation with deep regret.'' **********Some analysts and former company executives said the men disagreed sharply over SmithKline's $500 million research and development budget and over the pace of the company's restructuring. **********In both cases, these people said, it was Mr. Ebright who was more impatient and results-oriented. **********''It is my suspicion that Ebright wanted to restructure more quickly and that Mr. Wendt wanted to keep things more as status quo,'' said Neil B. Sweig, a Prudential-Bache Securities analyst. **********The announcement fueled takeover speculation about the pharmaceutical giant. SmithKline's stock rose $1.375 yesterday, to $52 a share, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts said the management shake-up would leave the company more vulnerable to a takeover while others said a major restructuring might be in the works. **********Analysts and investment bankers disagree on how likely an unfriendly takeover of the company is in the wake of last year's unsuccessful bid by Hoffmann LaRoche for Sterling Drug Inc. - an industry first. Foreign companies might consider entering the fray as a friendly buyer, one banker said. **********Two names that have been widely bandied about are Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan and Beecham Group P.L.C. of London. **********''I think there are more logical candidates,'' said David Paisley, a University of Illinois chemistry professor and industry consultant. ''Du Pont instantly comes to mind. Du Pont has been trying to get into pharmaceutical business for as along as anyone remembers, but haven't really had the mechanism that Smith Kline would give them.'' **********The resignation is the latest in a string of high-level departures at the company, which reported disappointing earnings growth last year. Blockbuster Drugs **********The earnings slowdown exacerbated worries that the company had failed to come up with suitable replacements for some of its biggest blockbuster drugs, including Tagamet, an anti-ulcer compound whose patent protection runs out in 1994, and Dyazide, a blood-pressure drug. **********Already, the drugs have lost market share. In a separate announcement, Smith Kline disclosed yesterday that Tagamet showed $1.02 billion in worldwide sales last year, down 9.7 percent from 1987, while Dyazide sales slowed to $200 million, down 44.4 percent. **********The drop in sales may have cost other top officials their jobs. James H. Cavanaugh, head of United States pharmaceutical sales, resigned last July. In August, Stanley Crooke, head of drug research, also left. **********Yesterday's announcement also marked a departure for a company that until now has showed a united front to Wall Street's clamoring for change. Indeed, last year when the company visited New York to explain its disappointing performance to the financial community, analysts recall that it was Mr. Ebright, the loyal second-in-command, who delivered the bad news. Mr. Wendt was absent. Taken By Surprise **********The falling out between the two executives took many - including at least one high-level insider - totally by surprise. Only eight days ago, a company official had invited the investment community to a meeting where Mr. Ebright was to speak. **********There were also rumors around the company's Philadelphia headquarters in the last few weeks that the company's management was exploring a leveraged buyout. **********Mr. Ebright, who will also step down from the board, joined the company in 1963 as an accountant.

Export growth has slowed somewhat, and at some point construction and housing should feel the bite of higher interest rates. Consumers Still Steaming Ahead **********But consumers, who represent two-thirds of the overall economy, are still steaming ahead. And while Friday's employment report showed pockets of weakness - including a decline in manufacturing employment and a negligible change in wage rates - non-farm payroll employment expanded by 289,000 last month, suggesting that income growth and consumer confidence will remain high. **********''There are some signs that the economy is slowing a bit,'' said Robert M. Giordano, a partner and co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, ''but we think that interest rates are quite a ways from their peak.'' **********Stephen S. Roach, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said that ''the ultimate task for the Fed is to slow the consumer down, and that is a tough task, because last year real incomes grew by 4 percent.'' 3% Growth Rate Seen The Fed's tactic of slowly inching rates higher is the correct course, Mr. Roach said, ''but we won't see any results until the second half of the year.'' **********Based on the employment data released Friday, Mr. Roach said that after taking out the effects of last summer's drought, the economy appears to be growing at a 3 percent rate in the first quarter. **********In assessing the impact of rising interest rates on consumers and businesses, some analysts like to look at the inflation-adjusted after-tax cost of borrowing. **********Steven Slifer, an economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities, said that on this basis ''short rates are still low relative to what they need to be to slow things down.'' Cost of Borrowing Estimated **********Using the 11.5 percent prime rate to represent short rates, a 34 percent tax bracket and inflation of 5 percent, Mr. Slifer said that at current levels interest rates are bearing an after-tax cost to borrowers of a little more than 2 percent. From November 1982 through the end of last year, the average after-tax cost was 2.9 percent, he added. **********''I would argue that the real after-tax rate has to be half a point above that average in order to slow the consumer and the economy down,'' he said. ''That would put the prime at 12 3/4 percent.'' **********Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that an increase in rates of that magnitude is unlikely. **********''There is no indication that rates will go significantly higher,'' he said. ''I could see another half-point rise, or a full point on the outside. But the concept of a slowing in the economy is true. Rates will continue to creep up for another couple of months, and then stay there, because there is no sign that inflation is topping out.'' Price Data Due Soon **********Worries about additional evidence that prices are moving higher will be widespread in the credit markets this week and next. **********Producer price data for February are scheduled to be released Friday, with consumer price figures due on March 21. **********Analysts say that a repetition of January's huge one-percentage-point increase in producer prices is extremely unlikely. But they fear that the number could be high enough to provoke the Federal Reserve to consider tightening credit conditions again, and possibly push the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate on bank loans, to 10 percent, from its current target range of 9 3/4 percent to 9 7/8 percent. **********''To me, the producer price number is more important than the employment report,'' said Mr. Fine, who is forecasting a rise of one-half of a percentage point in the index. **********''That won't provoke an immediate reaction from the Fed,'' he said, ''but it will make them a little itchy.'' Merchandise Trade Figures **********Another important economic report will come on Wednesday, when merchandise trade figures for January are released. **********While reduction in the trade deficit during 1989 is not likely to come close to equaling the $33 billion drop recorded during 1988, Wall Street analysts are anticipating that January's figures should show some narrowing from the $10.2 billion shortfall recorded in December. **********Continued improvement last year in the trade deficit was a significant factor in the dollar's relative stability during 1988. That stability, in turn, encouraged foreign investors to purchase Treasury securities. **********Newly released data from Salomon Brothers show how important foreign buying has become. **********Last year, foreign purchases of Treasury securities amounted to a record $61 billion, up more than 70 percent from the $35.9 billion foreigners bought in 1987. **********Susan Herring, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that Treasury figures suggest that Japanese buyers, private and official, accounted for 45 percent of all foreign purchases last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/23/world/full-of-fight-yeltsin-feels-he-s-the-one.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 860, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Full of Fight, Yeltsin Feels He's the One", "print_headline": "Full of Fight, Yeltsin Feels He's the One", "body_text": " **********Boris N. Yeltsin leaned into the microphone at the elegant Hall of Columns and bellowed his determination to battle the almighty bureaucrats: ''I am physically fit and ready to fight.'' **********Early today, Mr. Yeltsin, who was demoted from his job as Moscow Communist Party leader a year and a half ago, got a new chance at political pugilism. He won a spot on the ballot for the capital's only at-large seat in the new national Congress of Deputies, which will be voted on by Moscow residents. **********Mr. Yeltsin, whose reputation as a ''give 'em hell'' populist soared after he was demoted, will face a quintessential insider: the director of the factory that makes limousines for the party elite. The race is sure to be one of the most closely watched and symbolically rich contests of the March 26 election. Vital Elections for Gorbachev **********The nominating process for the new Congress ended today, beginning a month-long general-election campaign, the first in Soviet history in which most of the races will be contested. The election is the critical stage in what Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has called a major realignment of power toward greater democracy. **********Some see the election as a chance to promote reform. But Mr. Yeltsin, a burly man with a wave of white hair and a lip that often seems curled on the verge of a defiant sneer, sees it as a vehicle of bitter popular discontent. **********Winning the nomination - Mr. Yeltsin was backed by a majority of the 875 electors who chose candidates for Moscow's single at-large seat - was a personal triumph for Mr. Yeltsin, who was publicly rebuked and ousted from the Politburo for sparring too roughly with the leadership. 'Rehabilitation for Me' **********Mr. Yeltsin appealed for rehabilitation at the 19th party conference, which was televised nationally. Flatly turned away by the party hierarchy, he said he saw this election as a second chance. **********Though he was selected to run in at least 13 precincts, Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged in an interview before the nominating vote that the at-large Moscow seat was the one that he most coveted. **********''This would mean a certain rehabilitation for me,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, now a high official in the Construction Ministry. ''I want to be chosen from here more than from anywhere else.'' **********Contenders for the city-wide nomination at one time included candidates as diverse as Andrei D. Sakharov, the human-rights advocate and physicist, and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, the leader of the Russian Republic and one of the 12 leaders of the ruling Communist Party. **********Dr. Sakharov, rebuffed by the Academy of Scientists as a candidate for one of its guaranteed seats, decided to drop out of all other races to protest the academy's unpopular decision. Mr. Vorotnikov bowed out to run for a safer seat in the city of Voronezh. **********The list of candidates was whittled to 10, including an astronaut, a famous folk singer and a school principal. Two Names Remain on Ballot **********When the vote was counted nearly 14 hours after the meeting began, two people had secured a majority of the 875 votes and the right to be on the ballot: Mr. Yeltsin, with 532 votes, and Yevgeny A. Brakov, the director of the Zil auto factory, with 577 votes. **********Mr. Yeltsin faces a tough campaign against Mr. Brakov, the head of a showcase factory and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. His predecessor at Zil, Valery T. Saikin, became the Mayor of Moscow. **********Although the meeting was officially a nominating session, it turned into a referendum on Mr. Yeltsin. Most of the 60 or so delegates who spoke from the floor spent much of their allotted two minutes defending or attacking him. **********''He is the man who can fight conformism, which is like a virus attacking all of us,'' said one delegate. **********''He promised us a lot, but he delivered nothing,'' countered another. **********''I would like to have thousands like him,'' came a punctuating remark.  Kiev Elections Criticized **********KIEV, U.S.S.R., Feb. 22 (AP) - Displaying an eight-foot rendition of a ballot with the names of candidates crossed out, protesters tonight criticized the Government's failure to allow multiple-candidate elections. **********The demonstration, by 500 people here in the Ukrainian capital, was the fourth in four nights. It was held under a special decree allowing spontaneous meetings on the March 26 elections. **********Demonstrations require Government permission, rarely forthcoming in the Ukraine. The republic's Communist Party leader, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, is the only holdover on the ruling Politburo from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev and tolerates little dissident. **********Mr. Shcherbitsky's name and those of other Ukranian officials were crossed out on the protesters' banner. One poster read: ''Fear!

Thousands have died in confrontations there in the last five years. **********In a gesture of reconciliation to a state so alienated it elected separatists to Parliament in the November elections, Mr. Singh told a largely Sikh audience at the shrine, the Golden Temple, that the heart of Punjab needs ''a healing touch.'' **********''The healing touch cannot be brought about at the point of bayonets, but with love, faith and the people's cooperation,'' he said after riding through the town, in militant Sikh territory, in an open jeep. **********Indian reporters accompanying the Prime Minister said crowds surged forward along the route to greet him. Seeking a Prompt Solution **********On his return to New Delhi, Mr. Singh promised to set up a nonpartisan conference to find a prompt solution to the crisis in Punjab, where militant Sikhs have been demanding a separate nation called Khalistan. **********The former Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, had also attempted to find a solution to the Punjab problem after his election in 1984. But his efforts collapsed, and within a few years the state government was dissolved and Punjab placed under direct rule from New Delhi under an appointed governor. **********Today, the most visible symbol of the failed policy, Siddharta Sankar Ray, the Governor of Punjab, resigned. His replacement, appointed by the President and presumed to have the blessing of the new Singh Government, is N. K.

Mr. Gandhi's mother and predecessor as Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a military invasion of the Golden Temple in June 1984 to root out armed militants. She was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards four months later. Days of Horror **********In the days after her death, when Mr. Gandhi stepped in as Prime Minister, thousands of Sikhs were killed by vengeful mobs in New Delhi and other cities.

Simultaneously, the Soviets have begun to push for talks on reducing or eliminating medium-range missiles in the region. **********Moscow's increasing concern about growing missile abilities among its neighbors to the south was highlighted when Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in his speech in Vienna opening the European conventional arms control talks March 6, appealed for extending disarmament to the Middle East. **********''In the Middle East and southwest Asia, that is, in close proximity to Europe, powerful weapons arsenals are being created,'' Mr. Shevardnadze told the gathering of NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers, adding that missiles have already appeared with a range of 1,500 miles - ''that is to say, of precisely the same class that is being eliminated from Europe.''

This means they would have to decide on very short notice whether to stick by their clients or provide them with some sort of nuclear guarantee of protection.'' Concern Over Launchings **********Among the specific factors of probable concern to the Soviets are these: *********** On Sept. 19, 1988, the Israeli Shavit booster rocket lifted a photographic satellite into orbit. A study published in October 1988 by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which designs nuclear warheads for the United States, analyzed the solid-propellant, three-stage rocket that must have been required to put the satellite into orbit. It concluded that if the system was converted to a two-stage ballistic missile, it would be able to carry a 2,420-pound warhead as far as Moscow. *********** In May 1987 and again last September, Israel test-fired its newest short-range missile, the Jericho-II, which is reported to have a range of 900 miles. *********** In October 1986, The Sunday Times of London published a report on Israel's nuclear weapons ability based on information provided by Mordechai Vanunu, who worked for 10 years in Israel's nuclear research plant in Dimona, indicating that Israel had built at least 100 and possibly as many as 200 nuclear weapons of varying power. *********** In early 1988, Saudi Arabia secretly acquired long-range, Chinese-made DF-3 ballistic missiles, which have a range of more than 1,200 miles. In April 1988, Iraq unveiled a modified version of the Soviet-made Scud-B missile, dubbed the Al Abbas, with a range of about 550 miles. Egypt is reportedly developing with Argentina the Condor II missile with a range of 500 miles. **********Mr. Shevardnadze, speaking in Cairo on Feb. 23, proposed the establishment of a ''military risk-reduction center'' among the nations in the region, ''the declaration of the Middle East as a nuclear-free and chemical-free zone,'' and mutual inspection and on-site monitoring by the various parties in the region to promote arms control. **********''In the 1970's Soviet policy in the Middle East seemed to be motivated entirely by a competition with the United States,'' said Galia Golan, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who now teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ''Their entire approach was to prevent a Pax Americana and to insure a role for themselves. That is no longer the case. I think they are being driven now by a genuine desire to see the conflict end -not because the Americans are gaining in the region, but because this region is becoming truly dangerous to them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/05/business/business-people-prime-chairman-says-it-s-time-to-move-on.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 521, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prime Chairman Says It's Time to Move On", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Prime Chairman Says It's Time to Move On", "body_text": " **********R.

Paul has turned the Centrust Savings Bank of Miami into the largest and fastest-growing savings and loan association in the Southeast. **********But now, his institution's ''collage of investments,'' as he puts it, and his trading panache have been hobbled by rising interest rates. And Centrust is no longer the rising star of the savings and loan business. **********Since 1984, when Mr. Paul took over the ailing Dade Savings and Loan Association, Centrust's assets have quintupled to more than $11 billion. At the same time, the renamed institution went from near-insolvency to profits of $300 million over five years. **********But with rising interest rates in the last nine months continuing to reduce the value of the bonds that Centrust's traders moved in and out of the bank's portfolio, profits suddenly evaporated. Centrust lost about $13 million from June to December of last year and said it expected to post a loss in the current quarter. **********''What Mr. Paul did, and without a penny from the bank board, was remarkable and lucky, but you can't throw seven with every roll,'' said Benjamin Bishop, president of Allen E. Ewing & Company of Jacksonville, Fla., which specializes in analyzing banking and savings and loan securities. ''He must upgrade the quality of his assets and make his regular S.&L. operations viable. The financial community is very skeptical of a company whose major earnings come from risky dealings in junk bonds and arbitrage.'' **********Mr. Paul is quick to defend his main strategy, which involves speculative buying and selling of bonds, mortgages and other securities, allowed by the savings industry deregulation earlier this decade, rather than relying on lending Centrust's cash deposits to homeowners, as the overwhelming majority of savings and loan institutions do. **********Sitting in his small, unpretentious office crammed with papers and with four computer screens flashing financial data behind him, Mr. Paul chain-smoked cigarettes and acknowledged the bank's present problem - even noting that, as of last September, Centrust was projecting sharply lower earnings on the assumption of rising interest rates this year. 'An Inherent Risk' **********''One cannot judge the success of an institution like ours on the basis of a few quarterly earnings,'' he said. ''There is an inherent risk in our portfolio acquisition, but we manage it by having different expiration dates of our liabilities and assets.'' But some analysts believe the 50-year-old banker, whom they describe as a supurb deal maker, might find it difficult to meet his modest $8.9 million profit projection for the 1989 fiscal year. They add that his institution could post its first loss in six years in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. **********A stocky man who looks younger than his age, Mr. Paul can be extremely polite and warm with strangers. However, he projects an image of a hard-driving executive who is accustomed to having his own way, or at least of having very few people question his views. Money Mostly Borrowed **********He said that he and his family owned about 47 percent of Centrust's shares, that his Saudi partner, Gaith Pharaon, owned 25 percent, and that employees owned 10 percent. Mr. Paul recalled with satisfaction that in November 1983, when with mostly borrowed money he assumed control of Dade Savings, few people here were willing to bet that he would be able to turn around that virtually insolvent institution. **********Mr. Paul dismissed all but one of Dade Savings' 40 officers and sold half of the 32 branches. He persuaded Federal regulators to allow him to sell the institution's approximately $1.9 billion fixed-rate portfolio for $1.4 billion, then its market value, and to consider the $525 million loss as good will, to be written off in 25 years. **********With that $1.4 billion and $500 million more from a bond offering, he told his new team of executives, mostly former Wall Street traders, to make money by buying and selling securities. Not until late in 1985 did he start soliciting deposits. Later, he began expanding branches throughout Florida, and now hopes to have 72 by the end of the year. **********''Centrust looks adequately capitalized,'' said James A. Verbrugge, professor of finance at the University of Georgia. ''But in the $556 million it's listed as capital at the end of the 1988 fiscal year, or 6 percent of the assets, $400 million was listed as good will. If you take out that intangible asset, the capital is reduced to only 1.6 percent.'' Sophisticated Traders **********Executives of Centrust have been reluctant to describe in detail the operations of its largest and biggest money-making division, the capital market group, which is staffed with sophisticated traders Mr. Paul hired from Wall Street firms. **********But according to other bankers, during the 1984-88 period, Centrust, in a typical operation, would buy $250 million of zero-coupon United States Government bonds with $50 million. It would then use that as collateral to raise $150 million in cash on the domestic and international markets. This cash would then be used to purchase, at a large discount, $300 million worth of high-yield ''junk bonds.'' **********For Centrust, the junk bonds produced a high yield, which flowed to the bottom line as profits. And assets swelled thanks to the leveraging of the original money put down to buy the zero-coupon bonds. Profit Made on Difference **********Centrust operatives, the bankers said, would also engage in arbitrage, large-scale buying and instant selling of securities, making a profit on the difference in quotations on New York, London and other stock exchanges. **********Since interest rates in that period were usually declining, most of the junk bonds were paying dividends and appreciating in price. Centrust would sell some of these bonds at a profit and purchase other high-risk bonds and large blocks of mortgages and brokered deposits through banks and financial institutions, rather than through its Florida branch network. **********While Centrust has not disclosed the size of its junk bond portfolio, according to a report in the Dec. 25 issue of Barron's, as of June 30, 1988, it was $1.3 billion, representing about 13 percent of its assets, the third-largest such ratio in the country. **********Centrust has also acquired interests in large real estate developments, among them its own building in downtown Miami, worth about $100 million, and tracts of undeveloped Florida land. **********Among the bank's speculative acquisitions has been a $28 million art collection, including a Rubens painting for which Mr. Paul paid $13.2 million to Sotheby's, the New York auction house. Centrust is under orders from Florida banking regulators, who are wary of the art portfolio's risk to Centrust's capital, to sell its art collection, designated as ''furniture and fixtures'' on the company's books. **********If, as some New York experts believe, the Rubens painting is worth not more than $6 million, its forced sale could give the bank a large loss. **********Rising interest rates have also reduced the value of the bonds in Centrust's portfolio. Its junk bonds declined at least 5 percent in the last six months of 1988, which for Centrust would cut their value about $60 million, according to Celia A. Vlasin, a research analyst with the Washington brokerage firm of Johnson, Lemon & Company who specializes in the savings and loan industry. **********Under current accounting procedures, which Federal regulators want to change, Centrust is not required to list the market value of its bond holdings. Moreover, Centrust may be required to sell, probably at a loss, some of these bonds under the new capital adequacy regulations proposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank last December. Still to be commented upon by the savings and loan industry, the regulations are expected to be in place by the middle of the year, with full complience scheduled for early 1993. **********According to Professor Verbrugge, under the new regulations, savings and loan associations will be required to increase their capital to 6 percent of the tangible, low-risk assets, thus forcing some institutions to restructure, with losses, their asset base. He also said the good will, which is now a large part of Centrust's capital, would have to be reviewed under the new regulations. **********Mr. Paul said that he had been raised in Miami Beach but that when he arrived here six years ago from New York, where he was a real estate developer, he was little known. **********Since then, he has became a prominent and controversial executive and community figure. With Ted Arison, the owner of Carnival Cruise Lines, he was instrumental in creating the New World Symphony, a much-acclaimed national youth orchestra. Tower a Downtown Landmark **********The 47-floor Centrust Tower, designed by the renowned architect I.M. Pei, is a downtown landmark whose 40,000-watt multicolor exterior lighting dramatically illuminates the night skyline of Miami. **********Mr. Paul is also a member of the so-called non-group, a secretive group of some 30 of Miami's most influential non-elected leaders, who at monthly private meetings discusses local issues and propose social and economic measures. **********In his non-business activities, Mr. Paul has not turned away from controversy either. His plan to install concrete pilings for his large yacht in Biscayne Bay, next to his residence on exclusive La Gorce Island, has been opposed by many of his wealthy neighbors and resulted in protracted litigation. There is another continuing lawsuit over the construction cost of his 94.9-foot yacht, which is equipped with gold-leaf ceilings, a marble fireplace and 10 televisions sets. **********''Am I controversial?'' Mr. Paul asked rhetorically. ''On occasion, I have not been as tactful as I should have been, but it was unintentional. But I have a compelling desire to be successful in what I do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/15/business/europe-sets-standards-for-tv-programs.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Montgomery", "pub_date": "1989-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Sets Standards for TV Programs", "print_headline": "Europe Sets Standards for TV Programs", "body_text": " **********The European Community today moved closer to a common policy on television broadcasting as it agreed to limit programs from the United States and to restrict commercials. **********After a 12-hour meeting that ended at 2:30 in the morning, cabinet ministers of the community's 12 member countries announced a consensus on most outstanding matters. **********The 22-nation Council of Europe has nearly completed a treaty covering the same ground.

French officials have not publicly supported the American assertion. American officials who asked not to be identified expressed concern over statements by Arab officials that they intended during the conference to link the issue of chemical weapons with Israel's presumed possession of nuclear weapons. **********The aim of the conference of more than 140 nations is to reinforce the 1925 convention barring the use of chemical weapons in war.

But American officials say extensive negotiations over a verification of other issues are still needed. **********Another concern of American officials is the definition of a chemical weapon. The United States, which took 50 years to ratify the 1925 pact banning the use of chemical weapons, did so on the condition that it exempted the use of herbicides and tear gas for certain military purposes. **********American officials have said they will oppose any effort to define chemical weapons broadly so as to include herbicides and riot gas, which were used in Vietnam, because that would imply that the United States used chemical weapons there. Effect on Use of Weapons **********A larger question is what effect the conference may have on deterring the use of chemical weapons. **********Western officials said public statements by nations like Iraq assailing the use of chemical weapons could make it politically more difficult for such third-world nations to use these weapons again. Iraq used chemical weapons against its own Kurdish population and against Iran. **********But the conference may also help strengthen Western policies to curb the use of chemical weapons. **********In calling for the conference, President Francois Mitterrand, for example, suggested that an embargo be imposed on the shipments of weapons and other goods to countries that use chemical weapons. France sold large quantities of arms to Iraq during its war with Iran despite Iraq's use of chemical weapons, experts say. **********France and other Western nations ''sat back and allowed Iraq to use chemical weapons and did very little about it,'' said Elisa D.

It attacks throats and lungs. It sometimes invades Dublin to such a degree that night appears to fall by midday. **********The smog choked the city mercilessly for about a week in November, with amounts nearly seven times above pollution levels considered worrisome by the World Health Organization. The situation prompted environmentalists to distribute hundreds of free surgical masks, as opposition politicians warned that people could die unless the Government effectively combated the persistent pall. **********Unlike the photochemical smogs that shroud some of the world's large metropolises, the haze here is smoke pollution. More than 80 percent of the problem stems from the 350,000 tons of coal Dubliners burn each year in their cozy fireplaces. Most of the coal is bituminous, which produces much smoke and ashes. A Temperature Inversion **********The Government says that for every ton burned in an open grate, more than 100 pounds of smoke, along with sulfur dioxide, is produced. On cold, windless nights when this city experiences a temperature inversion, in which warm air traps cooler air near the earth's surface, preventing the normal rising of surface air, the cool air hovering over the ground can trap the smoke spiraling from chimneys. The result is smog. **********''It's disgusting,'' said John Gormley, campaign director of the Green Party, which concentrates on environmental issues.

The situation these days in Dublin, the fulcrum for a third of the nation's 3.5 million residents, has been described by Ireland's Minister for the Environment, Padraig Flynn, as the country's most serious air pollution problem and perhaps the most important environmental challenge facing the city. Other Cities Are Smaller **********Other cities in the country do not have the problem because their populations and concentrations of domestic fires are much smaller. Following the World Health Organization's recommendations, the European Community in 1983 set smog limits at 250 micrograms per cubic meter of air but gave member countries until 1993 to put laws and practical measures into effect to insure compliance. **********If countries violate the limits after the deadline, legal action can be taken against them in the European Court. The smoke pollution in Dublin a couple of months ago reached more than 1,700 micrograms per cubic meter. **********''There have been serious breaches of the smog standards,'' said Pat Macken, a spokesman for the Department of the Environment. ''People in Ireland like the open fire, but the Minister for the Environment has said that we can't sacrifice the environment to protect our comfort. **********''Some commentators say ban bituminous coal. Given the large amount burned, we have to change the supply situation. We have to step up the supply of smokeless fuel but the market here is geared to burning ordinary coal. Restructuring will take time. The problem doesn't lend itself to a push-button, magic-wand solution.'' A Government Pledge **********The Government has pledged to vanquish the smog, using a variety of weapons. Parliament passed the Air Pollution Act in 1987, which provided the statutory framework to apply intensive remedial measures. Since then, several ''smoke control'' areas have been designated in the worst affected communities, which tend to be working-class neighborhoods with large public housing complexes. **********By May 31, home owners in these special zones will be allowed to burn only authorized fuels, including oil, gas and smokeless coal. A total of nearly $2 million is being offered to residents to help them pay for any necessary heating adaptations. **********Arrangements have also been made with the national meteorological service to put a smog alert system into effect. The price of smokeless coal - it has been unpopular in poorer neighborhoods because it costs more than the ordinary variety - has been reduced during periods when the smog creeps in. **********A television and radio campaign says: ''Stop smog. Switch to smokeless.'' Mr. Macken said that research had shown that many people did not realize that most of the pollution was caused by their own fires. Packing Doctors' Offices **********''Whenever we have a bad weekend of smog, the doctors' offices are packed,'' said Jim Mitchell, a Member of Parliament for the main opposition party, Fine Gael. He represents the working-class area of Ballyfermot, where the smog problem is worse than anywhere else in the city. **********''Some of my elderly constituents have been advised by their doctor to go stay with a son or daughter who lives further out of town. There is a great increase in prescription drugs and in hospitalizations. Much of the cost is born by the state. **********''I have argued that we must do something about this problem because it would be a saving to the state and a saving to people in health terms. That's why it's important to get ahead with things. Last winter was quite bad and this winter we have had some bad spells. There has been some starting up of activity to do something about it, which makes me more hopeful for next winter than I had been.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/05/world/keihoku-journal-one-man-s-struggle-to-preserve-a-bitter-memory.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1989-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1012, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Keihoku Journal; One Man's Struggle to Preserve a Bitter Memory", "print_headline": "Keihoku Journal; One Man's Struggle to Preserve a Bitter Memory", "body_text": " **********Like nearly everyone else in this history-obsessed nation, Jeong Ho Lee has a passion for remembering. **********Mr. Lee's problem is that he wants to remind the Japanese about one of the few national topics that they would rather forget: the troubled history of Koreans in Japan. A Korean himself, Mr. Lee has pitted himself against a communal will to ignore that is as persistent as the penchant of Japanese for memorializing just about everything associated with their culture. **********Mr. Lee's story of frustration and then melancholy success in building a modest memorial to one group of Koreans - those who worked the crude manganese mines in this Appalachia-like region north of Kyoto - illuminates a usually hidden side of Japan. Fighting Oblivion **********It is also a facet that has, to the embarrassment of the Government, been thrust into the headlines recently because of a scandal over large donations to Japanese politicians by organizations of Korean pinball-parlor operators. When there was a backlash in which Japanese reportedly assaulted ordinary Koreans, even children, Korean residents demanded Government action. **********Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu infuriated the Koreans even more, however, when he was quoted as saying: ''I didn't bully anyone myself, after all, and I'm not in a position to go and look for the bullies either. Those in charge will take care of it.'' **********The episode only underscored something that Mr. Lee said he has spent a lifetime learning, that those who choose to lead the lives of eternal outsiders in Japan will be deprived of not just basic opportunities, but the thing Japanese cherish most -recognition for their contributions and a place in the collective memory. **********Though black-lung disease has crippled Mr. Lee at 57 years old, he is fighting that oblivion with remarkable energy. The local government refused any assistance. So he went heavily into debt to build his Tanba manganese memorial hall alone, and completed it a few months ago. **********''Koreans, like Japanese, can go to where their ancestors lived and they will be told who they are,'' Mr. Lee said. ''If we just die, there will be nothing left of our history. Someone had to tell this story.'' Life of Hardship **********Mr. Lee said his parents came to Japan from Korea, then a Japanese colony, around 1930 in search of work. Later, during the war, millions of Koreans were conscripted to keep Japan's industrial machine churning out armaments. Mr. Lee's family ended up in this hard-scrabble, heavily wooded region, called Tanba, and worked at the mines. He eventually dropped out of junior high school to become a miner, too. **********Although it comes as a shock to many Japanese from Kyoto, the picturesque old imperial capital 40 miles south of here filled with zen gardens and temples, the rustic hills around Keihoku were a principal source of manganese, used in batteries and for hardening steel. **********As illustrated by the simple but vivid exhibits at the restored mine, the miners led a mean existence. One had to stoop to enter the rough shafts, which were blasted open with dynamite. They grew narrower as they wound their way through hundreds of frightening yards toward the modest pockets of ore. The harsh conditions took their toll; the miners usually had to retire by the time they hit 40 and often died before they were 50 years old, Mr. Lee said. No Options for Koreans **********Since the deposits were small -each mine employed just a dozen or so workers - and the mining methods primitive, imports began to displace the industry. With the closings, the few Japanese miners drifted off, Mr. Lee recalled, many of them to work at local farms. But the Koreans did not have that option. **********''About the most promising choice they had was to try and form their own small companies and keep mining, because most other companies would not take them,'' said Nobuhiro Imoto, a geology professor at Kyoto National Education University and an expert on manganese mining who worked with Mr. Lee. **********Twenty- and thirty-year-old photos on the wall of the memorial hall show Mr. Lee with his friends, a smiling, vigorous, pudgy figure. But he recalled those days with bitterness because of the relentless poverty. ''We were full of ideas like starting a cement company or construction company,'' he said. ''But we could never get the money. Loans were not available for Koreans.'' **********Forced to retire nearly 15 years ago because of failing health, Mr. Lee said that was when he began to realize that the Japanese just wanted to forget the crude mines and the men who gave their lives to them. **********''He began saying how regrettable it would be if the miners were simply forgotten, as though they had never been there,'' Professor Imoto said. ''But I should stress that his sympathy was not just for Koreans, but also for the Japanese miners.'' **********A town official insisted in a telephone interview that it was a private, not a public matter, and thus government help was not appropriate. The town official undercut his own argument, though, by saying the town might help if the memorial hall began to attract more people. **********Mr. Lee constructed the hall on a spot where his old company still held mining rights, at the end of a dirt and gravel road. In the dank white building displays of old tools were arranged. The mine shaft was widened and, using mannequins, simple displays created to show how the miners crouched for hours in the damp and chill. **********Today, only a trickle of people pay the $4 fee to see the hall and mine. **********''I am really proud,'' Mr. Lee said, exhausted after showing a visitor around and barely able to stand. ''Now I want to make videos of the miners, before we're all gone for good.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Hoffman, the longtime chairman of both Woodward & Lothrop and Wanamaker. Mr. Aronson will also be an investor in the recapitalized company, Taubman said. **********Taubman Investment, headed by A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer and entrepreneur, also said that it would substantially increase its equity in both retail divisions to finance ''an aggressive'' capital spending program. Both retail chains have 15 stores with total sales of about $1 billion. Mr. Hoffman will remain a board member and Robert J. Mulligan, vice chairman, will continue in that position. Tom L. Roach, Woodward & Lothrop president, is resigning to pursue other interests. **********Last September, Taubman Investment said it was putting up for sale both companies and assigned two investment-banking concerns to determine the market interest in both companies. However, while the Taubman company would not comment, retail executives close to the company have said that the prices offered have been less than Taubman wanted. **********For the 54-year old Mr. Aronson, the appointment to head two of America's oldest department store chains represents a return to a senior post in retailing after more than two years. In the 1970's and mid-1980's, he was one of the best-known and most respected specialty store merchants, heading Saks from 1979 to 1982. From 1983 to 1986, he was chairman and chief executive of the Batus Retail Group, owned by B.A.T. Industries of London, which at the time consisted of Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field, Gimbel Brothers, Ivey's, Frederick & Nelson, the Crescent, Kohl's, Breuner's and Thimbles. Batus has since retained only Saks, Marshall Field, Ivey's and Breuner's. **********From 1986 until now, Mr. Aronson has been a consultant and investor. **********Mr. Aronson said in a telephone interview that he had been among those who had wanted to buy Woodward & Lothrop. But Taubman elected to retain the companies and ''now I will have a substantial portion of the equity in the combined company.'' He added, ''There has to be a refocusing of both companies and I feel that my background at both Saks and Batus gives me a solid basis to take on such an opportunity.'' In a formal statement, he said, ''The Woodie's and Wanamaker's stores are important and historic franchises in two of the best markets in the country.'' **********But both chains have suffered from a profit erosion, other retailers said, and Wanamaker's, in particular, has needed an infusion of capital to modernize a number of its stores. Its huge flagship store in midtown Philadelphia - about as large as Macy's Herald Square - is being converted to an office building and the store reduced to about half its present size. **********Asked why he decided to return to an active, retailing post, Mr. Aronson replied: ''I still retain a major lust for the retail business.

Baker 3d arrived in Rome on a tour of all the NATO countries. High-Level Post Sought **********The decision on the NATO military post produced a sharp reaction in Rome earlier this month, and Mr. Zanone echoed Italian concerns, pointing out that no officer from a Mediterranean country - Italy, Turkey, Greece or Spain - had been elected to the position since it was created in the early 1960's. **********''It is almost 30 years,'' he said.

The agency still owns 1.03 million warrants for First City shares, which it plans to sell soon. **********The agency had insisted on acquiring the stake, which it purchased for $43.1 million in April 1988, when a group headed by A. Robert Abboud took control of First City. The Government's equity stake was a small amount compared with the money it advanced to keep First City afloat. The F.D.I.C. provided $970 million in September 1987 to cover estimated losses at the old First City, which was near collapse with mounting troubles with energy and real estate loans. The Abboud group raised $500 million in private funds to complete the recapitalization of the Houston-based bank. **********The issues raised by the F.D.I.C.'s success in the First City deal are whether the Government should demand similar stakes in the more than 500 troubled savings institutions it will soon control and what form the ownership should take. **********Congress is debating the final form of the Administration's proposal to rescue the savings industry, which has a projected cost of $157 billion over the next 10 years and $300 billion over 30 years. **********Some analysts estimate that as much as $150 billion in real estate in the troubled institutions will be sold by new owners who acquire the troubled institutions or directly by the new agency created to help in the crisis, the Resolution Trust Corporation. The potential conflict for the Government in regulating sales of huge amounts of property and sharing ownership in the institutions that handle the sales still must be sorted out. **********''One of the fundamental questions for the Resolution Trust Corporation is whether it should take any equity or other contingent interests in the savings and loans,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C. The answer will most likely come from the Treasury Department, which Congress wants to oversee the far-reaching, economic impact of Resolution Trust's decisions. **********The past provides little guidance because the F.D.I.C., which insures bank deposits up to $100,000 and manages bank liquidations and rescues, has held few equity positions in recapitalized banks. It received $1.8 billion in fees from banks last year and $1.4 billion from interest on its $14 billion fund. **********Collections from bad loans it inherits after failures or rescues is another importance revenue source. The agency typically recovers between 20 percent and 30 percent of the face values of problem loans. Last year, the total recovered was $2.3 billion and collections were at a similar pace through the first six months this year. It was managing $10.4 billion in problem assets on June 30. **********Mr. Seidman, who said he is pragmatic on the conflict issue, said the Government should be allowed to be partial owner when such an arrangement could lower rescue costs. ''We made a fine return'' on the stake in First City, he added. **********The agency sold its First City shares through a hastily arranged auction on July 19.

The competitors turned out to be Donaldson, Lufkin; Kidder, Peabody; Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Salomon Brothers. **********Donaldson, Lufkin's winning offer paid the F.D.I.C. $33.575 a share, a slight premium over the market. Minutes before the market closed the same day, equity traders at the firm sold the First City shares to several insurance companies, pension funds and other institutions for $34 a share. **********John S.

Others who were especially aggressive in classifying the payments - as stock options perhaps -may be notified by the Internal Revenue Service that additional taxes, plus interest, are owed. **********The new regulations clarify what compensation actually counts as part of a golden parachute agreement. At issue is when an agreement exceeds the requirements for a ''safe harbor'' - three times the average annual compensation shown on the individual's W-2 forms for the last five years. Payments in excess of the safe harbor limits that are made to those regarded as ''disqualified individuals'' - generally the top officers and largest shareholders - are subject to a 20 percent excise tax. **********Wallace L. Head, a partner with Arthur Andersen & Company in Chicago, characterized the proposed regulations as ''fairly well thought out, middle-of-the-road'' rules that are unlikely to change although the Treasury Department has no timetable for designating them as permanent. Anyone negotiating an employment contract would be well advised to take them into account. **********Mr. Head said ''a few hundred in our practice'' would be able to claim tax refunds and in some cases additional payments from their employers. **********Those who end up owing additional taxes are not required to file amended returns and pay simply because of the issuance of the regulations, he said. But anyone who can reasonably expect to be audited - like those who own tax shelter investments or have been aggressive in claiming deductions -might be better off filing an amended return and paying rather than waiting for the I.R.S. notice, because of the interest, he said. **********In the last few years before the regulations were issued, accountants often had to be subjective about classifying some payments negotiated at the time of a takeover or merger, Mr. Head said. **********One important issue clarified by the regulations is the treatment of stock options, which many executives receive as part of their compensation package. When a company is merged or taken over, payments are likely to be made to all holders of options on its shares, including executives who have options but have not yet been vested. **********In cases where the share's value is well above the exercise price of the option, an executive may end up receiving a large payment far earlier than he or she anticipated when the employment package was negotiated. Many financial advisers may have treated some or all of the payment to unvested option holders as a golden parachute payment, subject to the 20 percent excise tax. Under the new regulations, payments to cover the unvested options are not regarded as part of the golden parachutes, and thus, not included in calculations about whether the parachute payments exceed the safe harbor limits. Those who treated excludable compensation as part of the parachute in recent years are in a position to seek refunds, Mr. Head said. **********To get a refund, a taxpayer must file an amended return within three years of the original filing. Taxpayers who extended their 1985 returns into Aug. 15, 1986 - as two thirds of those involved in golden parachutes are likely to have done -have a few days in which to prepare an amended return, he said. Those who received golden parachutes in 1986, 1987 or 1988 have more time to review their situations. **********A change in corporate control must have occurred for payment to be classified as a golden parachute, as distinct from a severence payment. Thus, although most people think of golden parachutes as payments executives receive in connection with losing their jobs, the rules also cover some executives who receive payments but stay on with their companies with diminished chances for advancement. **********In these cases, the new regulations may make it worth an executive's while to renegotiate his compensation package. Often, the payments have been kept within the safe harbor requirements because it was widely assumed that the recipient would have to pay the excise tax on excesses and that the employer could not deduct them as compensation. **********Anyone whose payment was capped by safe harbor calculations would be well advised to review the situation with the employer and see if he or she can get an additional payment as a result of the new regulations, Mr. Head said. **********In light of the new regulations and the recent pace of corporate takeovers Mr. Head said, all compensation programs, arrangements and employment contracts should be reviewed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/29/business/3-presidents-at-american-express.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Presidents at American Express", "print_headline": "3 Presidents at American Express", "body_text": " **********The American Express Company said Thursday that it was restructuring its Travel Related Services Company, in the process naming three new presidents. **********Edwin M.

Sweetnam Jr. may fit those characteristics, the results of his report on the California Energy Company, a producer of geothermal energy, have been extraordinary. The stock price plunged, the company reacted with fury and the research director of Kidder, Peabody & Company, Mr. Sweetnam's firm, felt called upon to write an open letter to clients defending him. **********Now California Energy, whose stock had been a phenomenal performer until Mr. Sweetnam issued his report, is trying to raise $50 million in an unusual offering that relies on investors believing its stock price will rise sharply over the next 15 years. No doubt that job would have been easier if Mr. Sweetnam had not issued his report. **********California Energy produces geothermal power by constructing power plants on top of naturally occurring underground steam. It has built several plants and has more under construction. The power is bought by the SCE Corporation, the parent company of Southern California Edison, under a contract that provides guaranteed rates for 10 years, after which they will be adjusted to reflect the costs of alternative power to the utility. **********The dispute over the value of California Energy essentially revolves around the question of what those rates are likely to be, with Mr. Sweetnam expecting far less inflation than is foreseen by an independent consultant hired by California Energy. There also are questions regarding just how high the company's operating expenses will be. **********Using what he deemed to be reasonable assumptions, Mr. Sweetnam concluded that California Energy, then selling at about $21 a share, was worth no more than $10. When word of that went out to the Kidder system the night of Feb. 23, the result was explosive. The next day 484,700 shares were traded, more than 10 times normal volume, and the price tumbled to $16.875 on the American Stock Exchange.

Condy, the company's chairman. **********Notwithstanding his surprise at the increase, Mr. Condy was far more disturbed by the decline. He denounced Mr. Sweetnam's report for containing ''ill-conceived and potentially fallacious conclusions.'' A rebuttal by a company consultant criticized Mr. Sweetnam's ''shallow and amateurish analysis of the California market'' and argued that future electric rates were likely to be far higher than the analyst expected. **********Mr. Sweetnam, 26 years old, joined Kidder less than four years ago, after graduating from Georgetown University. He began as an assistant to an analyst and was promoted to analyst about a year and a half ago. California Energy was the fifth stock on which he had published an opinion, and the first he had recommended selling. **********''I was evaluating a stock selling at 10 times book value,'' said Mr. Sweetnam, adding that his job was to give his opinion of a company's prospects. ''I guess what people want me to do is parrot back what the company is telling me. If so, there's no need for me to be in the loop at all. I can't think of any other reason why everyone is so angry.'' **********Mr. Condy said that a couple of weeks before Kidder published its report, Kidder officials had warned a major British institution, which he would not identify, that the report was coming. Kidder's research director, R. Joseph Fuchs, called that assertion ''absolutely, completely and totally false.'' While Mr. Sweetnam did respondo o customerueueries about industry funmemealal M Mr. Fuchs said, ''I am absolutely sure that under no circumstances would there ever be a telegraphing that we are planning to do thus and so.'' **********In any case, the stock action before Feb. 23 does not show the type of volume increase that might be expected if rumors were widespread. **********Just how much California Energy has been hurt in investor perception may become clearer next week, when it plans to raise $50 million by selling zero-coupon convertible bonds through Merrill Lynch & Company. Those bonds will accrue interest at 8.5 percent a year and mature in 2004. For the conversion feature to be attractive, the company's stock price would have to rise by more than 8.5 percent a year, because anyone who converts will give up the accrued interest. **********If the issue sells, it will be a sign that enough investors agree with Mr. Condy, California Energy's chairman, when he says of Mr. Sweetnam, ''His impression of what is going on out here is of absolutely no value.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/business/creditors-question-eastern.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1989-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 441, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Creditors Question Eastern", "print_headline": "Creditors Question Eastern", "body_text": " **********The unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines voted unanimously at their meeting Tuesday to have their own financial advisers examine alternative approaches to the airline's plans for its emergence from bankruptcy.

These days, even the word ethics can be confusing. Some say management ethics can be summed up in phrases like ''don't steal,'' while others argue that ethics are part of a larger social agenda for a business or company. **********But my thesis is different. I start with what management ethics are not. It is not moral ideals. It is not simply abiding by the law. It is not a strictly defined code. Nor is it a criticism of past events. **********At its very best, ethics are a continuing process that incorporates a number of different disciplines. But more important - and simply - ethical behavior is based on the ideal of taking full responsibility for thinking through daily managerial problems and making everyday decisions with a view toward fair play. **********Managers tend to be doers, competitors, goal-oriented, practical, good with facts and numbers, suspicious of sentiment and very busy. They do not routinely pick up paperbacks by Jeremy Bentham or Thomas More for airport reading. They define their jobs with precision and stick to chains of command, responsibility and communication. They believe in loyalty up and down the organizational chart and sometimes subordinate their own personal values to the corporate-team culture. **********These are good qualities and they provide an essential foundation on which to build ethical behavior. But managers also need new tools that can encourage them to take in a broader view of the world, a longer sense of time and a better appreciation and understanding of their own experiences. Such ethical insights should be regarded as part of each responsible manager's everyday activity and not a thing apart. **********To add long-range value, managers must treat those affected by their decisions as people with a stake in those decision - people to whom a responsibility is owed. That means that a manager, at the beginning of the decision-making process, should seek some measure of participation in the decision - whether by a vote or some other kind of input - from the people who will be affected. **********Responsible managers also need to be knowledgeable workers, detail people comfortable with the specifics of each situation that requires a decision. Without that detailed knowledge, alternatives cannot be chosen that fit an acceptable standard of fair play. **********As part of their cost-benefit analyses, the best managers I know explore the human and financial, long- and short-range implications of their decisions. When consequences may involve death to some of those affected, whether from a risky workplace or the premature introduction or mislabeling of a product, the analysis must be more than business-as-usual - much more. Equally sensitive attention is required if those affected by a decision may risk poverty from the loss of pension and health benefits or the death of spirit that comes from corrupt surroundings. **********RESPONSIBILE decisions come after the right people have provided the needed input and participated in those decisions. Responsible decisions require that people and groups that may be affected have been correctly identified, and the consequences of the contemplated actions anticipated. **********It is especially important that ethical decision makers see the negative consequences - the harm, the dislocations - of their decisions. When people are very busy, that can be difficult. To become responsible managers, people need practice, special structures and experience-proven short cuts. There is simply no other way to insure fair play. **********Formal simulations and case studies using real dilemmas can provide managers with the kind of practice that will help them in their daily decisions. It will help them create the special structures that must built into their organizations, like the ''Chinese Walls'' that are needed to stop communications between departments with conflicting interests. In finance, those departments that must be kept isolated are investment banking and investment management. In journalism, they would be editorial and advertising. **********In addition, an organization could reorganize its business completely to eliminate an identified conflict, as we did at Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc. in the early 1920's, when we ceased our brokerage activities so that they would not conflict with our duties as investment counselors. **********The crux of ethics is realized when responsible managers anticipate the prospective good and prospective harm resulting from their decisions and are committed to being fair in the mix. Only a real manager can exercise responsibility ethically, because only a person who understands the details of a problem and details of the options can make an ethically responsible decision."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/15/business/business-people-head-of-stock-trading-resigns-at-first-boston.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1989-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Head of Stock Trading Resigns at First Boston", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Head of Stock Trading Resigns at First Boston", "body_text": " **********Luis S.

On the technical side, traders pointed out that the dollar, when it was declining, got some support when it failed to break through the 1.8 level against the West German mark. **********But Frank Watson, vice president of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said that the small rally might be just a ''correction'' and that the dollar could resume its decline. **********In late afternoon trading, the dollar was at 128.23 Japanese yen and 1.8363 marks, up from 126.89 yen and 1.8227 marks on Tuesday. **********The dollar was also up against the Swiss franc at 1.5690, compared with 1.5549 on Tuesday.

Yet it is often overlooked, said Edward Rosenson, a partner with Arthur Young, who is in charge of personal financial planning for the accounting firm's Los Angeles area offices. **********To be ''durable,'' the document, which a lawyer drafts using a standard form, must state specifically that it will remain valid and effective even if the person becomes incapacitated. That enables another person to take over his or her financial affairs, both business and personal, without disruption and without the expense and delay involved in getting a court order. Yet many people who have prepared their wills have failed to prepare for the possibility that they could be disabled for a prolonged period, Mr. Rosenson says. **********''I consider it an integral part of the estate-planning process,'' he said. ''It applies to almost anybody over age 30.'' The elderly and sole proprietors of a business should be particularly diligent in drawing up a durable power of attorney, he added, and people with elderly parents should encourage their parents to do so. **********If an elderly person develops Alzheimer's disease, for example, and is not competent to pay monthly bills, file income taxes or tend to other financial affairs, a son or daughter may have to go to court and prove incompetency to be appointed as guardian or conservator. In the meantime the son or daughter may be paying the bills from his or her own account. But a child who has a durable power of attorney, can step in and take over the parent's financial affairs as soon as a physician certifies the parent is not competent. **********In California, Mr. Rosenson said, it is advisable to have the document recorded with the county recorder or township, but some jurisdictions require no filing. **********In the case of the owner of a business who is injured in in a car crash and is comatose, the business and the employees may face a period of turmoil unless someone can assume responsibility immediately. **********Wives and husbands often designate each other, he said, although there should also be a second choice in case the first choice is not available. For single people, as well as for some married people, another relative, a lawyer, a close personal friend or a business partner would be the choice. Some spouses might be ruled out because they are not comfortable or competent with financial matters, and in other cases - like second marriages of spouses with financial obligations from first marriages - the situation could create conflicts. **********Business owners often need two durable powers of attorney, Mr. Rosenson said. A spouse or another relative is designated for personal matters and a business partner or lawyer for the business. The second one might receive compensation, to be detailed in the legal document, he added. **********In California a durable power of attorney regarding financial matters is separate from a durable health-care power of attorney, which may be given to a physician, he noted. A lawyer can draw them up at the same time. The medical document deals with the health care of an incompetent person, such as whether extraordinary life-saving measures should be used in a case of terminal illness. **********The person holding the financial power of attorney can go beyond bill paying, Mr. Rosenson noted, to take care of such needs as tax payment, gift-giving and investment management. **********All 50 states and the District of Columbia recognize some form of the durable power of attorney, he said, but laws vary from state to state, so it is important to consult a lawyer in one's own state. Also, the person granting the power of attorney can revoke or modify it at any time.  Free Advice **********Perhaps there are no free lunches, as the cynical like to say.

The seemingly inevitable increases in advertiser spending, predictable cash flows and loyal audiences made owning a network affiliate a sure-fire investment. **********But network television is now going through hard times. Competition from independent stations and cable has intensified, while programming costs have skyrocketed and advertising growth has slowed. **********The difficulties for network affiliates are especially evident in the financial data of the eight stations that Knight-Ridder Inc. is selling. The proprietary information was circulated to potential buyers by the company's investment banker, Goldman, Sachs & Company. Possible $450 Million Price **********Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, is said to be seeking about $450 million for the stations, which it bought during the last 10 years for a total of $319 million. It announced in October that it would sell the stations to reduce its debt and to focus on its newspapers and other media businesses. **********Some analysts and media experts say the stations have been poorly managed. ''The stations have been very disappointing in profitability,'' said Peter Falco, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********Media analysts consider the operating cash flow of a station to be the true measure of its performance, because station depreciation and capital expenditures are generally minimal. In the case of Knight-Ridder's stations, the cash flow seems weak. **********Last year, the Knight-Ridder stations had an estimated cash flow of $31 million on revenues of $110 million, giving them a 28 percent margin. Below Industry Averages **********But cash-flow margins for affiliates average 36 to 42 percent, said Ralph Becker, a general partner and chief operating officer of Television Station Partners, which owns four network affiliates. He said the stations his company owns had cash-flow margins that averaged 48.5 percent. **********Not only are Knight-Ridder's margins lower than those of some competitors, they have deterioriated since 1984, when the stations had total cash flow of $35 million on revenues of $92 million. **********''I cannot understand how a publicly held company with a good track record in its other divisions can tolerate such poor management,'' Mr. Becker said. **********Knight-Ridder's stations have run into many problems, including a weak advertising market. Local advertising revenues rose only 7 percent last year while spot advertising was up only 5 percent, said Robert Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting for the McCann-Erickson advertising agency. ''In other Olympic and election years, spending in those categories has risen at least 12 percent,'' he said. **********But some problems at Knight-Ridder's stations extend back several years. At four stations, revenues have virtually been flat since 1984. In addition, the operating cash flow at five stations has deteriorated in the same period. At WTKR-TV in Norfolk, Va., operating cash flow dropped to an estimated $4.8 million last year, from $7.9 million in 1984. At WTEN-TV in Albany, it declined to $3.7 million, from $6.1 million. At KOLD-TV in Tucson, Ariz., it fell to $1.1 million, from $1.8 million. At KTVY-TV in Oklahoma City, it dropped to $3.7 million, from $4.5 million. And at WJRT-TV, in Flint, Mich., it was down to $3.6 million, from $4.8 million. **********Knight-Ridder's other stations are WALA-TV in Mobile, Ala.; WPRI-TV in Providence, R.I., and WKRN-TV in Nashville. **********Dan Gold, president of Knight-Ridder's television stations since 1985, said the stations' revenues will improve. He said Knight-Ridder had made ''a long-term strategic decision to invest a lot in programming and news'' to bolster ratings. Relative Newcomer **********Knight-Ridder, whose television stations account for only about 5 percent of its revenues, is a relative newcomer to broadcasting. It bought its first three stations in 1978. Since then, television programming has become more costly and more risky. **********WJRT-TV in Flint, for example, has the second-highest rating in its market, but its programming costs have soared. The result has been that since 1984 WJRT's operating costs have risen 55 percent, while revenues have risen only about 24 percent. Indeed, since 1987, revenues have been flat. **********The story at WTKR-TV in Norfolk is little better. The CBS affiliate's revenues were virtually flat during the last five years in a market where overall advertiser spending rose 30 percent. In addition, ratings for WTKR's news programs fell after Knight-Ridder discharged the station's news anchor team in 1985. Profitable News Programs **********Meanwhile, WTKR's rivals thrived. WVEC-TV, an ABC affiliate, became the ratings leader in early news, and WAVY-TV, the NBC affiliate, became the leader in late evening news. **********News is a major profit center for local stations and a strong news program can benefit the evening line-up.

An example that appeared last week is Freeport-McMoran Energy Partners Ltd., an offshoot of Freeport-McMoran Inc. **********When Freeport-McMoran Energy Partners went public in 1985, investors got what sounded like a tempting offer: a guaranteed 10 percent yield, much or all of it free from Federal taxes, in return for paying $22 per partnership unit. **********That yield was guaranteed by the parent company for five years, and it has kept its promise. But the cost of keeping that promise has been a steady dilution in the stake of the partners, and the dividends have not been enough to offset the falling value of the partnership unit. **********Now, Freeport-McMoran Energy proposes to convert itself from a partnership to a corporation, thus giving up some tax advantages. The company is hinting strongly that when it makes the conversion, its dividend will be cut radically, if not eliminated entirely. **********That the dividend could not continue indefinitely was clear from a careful reading of the company's financial documents when it went public, and it remains clear today. The cash flow that investors should have looked at was that of Freeport-McMoran Energy, not the one that the parent promised to them. Freeport-McMoran Energy has never had the cash flow to pay that level of dividends to all unit holders. It managed to do so by having its parent take its dividends not in cash but in more partnership units, thereby reducing the relative ownership of the public partners. **********Investors who bought at the offering in 1985, and paid $22 a unit, now hold units worth about $9.50 at recent prices on the New York Stock Exchange. These investors have also received $9.90 in cash and have a promise that they will get another $1.10. None of the payouts were taxable, because they counted as return of principal, which only reduces the holder's basis in the security. The partnership has not had taxable income to distribute. **********These investors have, in other words, done a bit worse than they would have done by putting the $22 in a cookie jar and taking out 55 cents every three months. That, too, would be nontaxable. **********That there are fads in the investment world is hardly news, but rarely are companies quite as open about being willing to take advantage of them. ''Market research has shown that while the oil and gas investor preferred yield securities during the 1980's, investors' interest, because of the outlook for energy into the 1990's, has been refocused on asset growth through additions to proved oil and gas reserves,'' explained James R. Moffett, the chairman of the parent company, in announcing the proposed change from partnership to corporation. **********Now, Freeport-McMoran Energy plans to be viewed as a company that has growing assets. And that, at least, is a view that by recent history seems more accurate than the view that it was a cash generator. In both 1987 and 1988, the company managed to discover so much oil and gas that its proved reserves rose even before including acquisitions. Craig Saporito, a spokesman for the company, said that as a result of the expanded reserves, there were now about as much in the way of proven reserves behind each partnership unit as there were when the partnership was sold to the public in 1985. **********Those reserves, alas, have not come cheaply. Freeport-McMoran Energy was forced to take a write-off in 1986 because the total value of its reserves was less than the amount it had invested in buying and finding them. Its acquisitions in 1987 and 1988 were for more than the value of the reserves, as computed by the method mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requiring it to get waivers to avoid a write-down. **********As of the end of 1988, however, the overall value of its reserves, including the acquisitions, was a bit higher than the value on the books: $1.238 billion, compared with $1.234 billion. That is not much of a margin, and it means that a further write-off could be coming this year, especially if oil prices weaken. **********By changing from partnership to corporate status, Freeport-McMoran Energy hopes to attract more institutional investors, many of whom have been put off by partnership tax-reporting rules. But the switchover also threatens to provoke selling from individual investors as they realize that the high dividends are going to come to an end early next year. Whether the selling by yield-seekers will be offset by the buying of institutions remains to be seen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/17/world/jamaica-election-set-for-february.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAMAICA ELECTION SET FOR FEBRUARY", "print_headline": "JAMAICA ELECTION SET FOR FEBRUARY", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Edward P.

''We're trying to replace one engine with a completely different engine.'' **********''What's happening in Poland, indeed in the whole bloc from the Alps to the Urals, is the process of liquidating Communism,'' he continued. ''We're in the process of emerging from a blind alley.'' **********Part of the problem is that Polish officials are still grappling with just what new economic path they want to follow. Should they imitate Margaret Thatcher's purist free market, move toward a Swedish-style social democracy or settle for something in between? **********In a new economic plan submitted to the International Monetary Fund, Poland aims to remove the price controls that have kept costs for basics like bread and gasoline artificially low. This, in turn, should encourage companies to increase production and help end shortages and the hourlong lines for such staples. **********But the country is already finding that ending 40 years of Government-subsidized inefficiency can hurt more than help in the short run, because prices for scarce goods often shoot up much faster than workers' wages. Fears of Financial Shock **********One result is that fears are growing here that a quick dismantling of the old system may create too great a shock for a nation already hobbled by poverty, food shortages and 500 percent inflation. **********There are also worries that ending subsidies could cripple numerous companies, causing a drop in production. Some economists predict that the crash economic program will generate 1,000 percent inflation and a recession, before prices slowly stabilize and production picks up again. When the Government lifted price controls on food on Oct. 1, bread prices jumped thirtyfold and inflation in general soared. **********Poland is entering uncharted economic waters as the new Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki gropes to find the most efficient and politically palatable way to put state-owned industry into private hands. It is also struggling to determine which long-subsidized manufacturing companies, which coal mines and which steel mills are so inefficient that they deserve to go bankrupt. **********Backers of the economic program formulated by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledge that it could mean some people find their wallets too thin to buy many items. Earning, Not Waiting **********''This would cause people to spend their hours trying to increase their income to get what they need, instead of spending hours waiting in line to get what they need,'' Mr. Kuczinski said. ''That will help the economy.'' In a nation with no official unemployment, another tough question is whether newly emboldened workers, including those in the Solidarity trade union, will go on strike when market forces dictate big layoffs. **********''I'm worried that this shock program might be taking too great a risk,'' said Ryszard Bugaj, a prominent Solidarity economist. ''If we accept this program, it has to be very well insured by our Western friends or else we could face catastrophe.'' He said the Government must provide some safety net to Poles who are laid off or left destitute by soaring inflation. **********Despite the economic anxieties, Poland's 37 million people overwhelmingly agree that the Government's new programs are needed to put the economy on a sound footing. Foreign Cash Needed **********Virtually everyone here seems to agree that for Poland's economic program to succeed, this capital-starved nation needs huge injections of foreign investment. Congress recently approved legislation that provides $852 million for Poland. **********In addition, four top advisers to President Bush and several representatives of business, labor and academia have just started a four-day mission in Poland to encourage the creation of a free-enterprise economy. The group includes Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********''Without external assistance we won't be able to make it,'' said Aleksander Paczynski, minister of construction and housing. ''We need foreign investment like we need oxygen.'' **********The economic transition will be even more difficult because of the dismal state of the economy. That includes $39 billion in foreign debt, galloping inflation, declining economic output, a shortage of bread and meat and wages averaging about $70 a month, at the official exchange rate. Breathing Space **********Polish officials say they need relief from current debt payments to give their nation some breathing space. They assert that the burden of debt repayments is largely responsible for the recent decline in economic production because many Polish companies no longer have enough dollars or other widely accepted currency to import much-needed raw materials. **********For example, at the Lenin Steelworks, the giant steel complex in southern Poland, managers complain that production will fall 10 percent this year because they do not have enough hard currency to buy high-grade Brazilian iron ore. **********One strong hope by Polish officials is that the International Monetary Fund will approve their economic program and will in turn approve a debt relief plan as well as provide new financial aid. The I.M.F. offers loans to countries willing to take tough measures to strengthen their economies. **********Besides removing price controls, Poland would also force companies to learn to survive with Government intervention. A further hope is to eliminate Poland's budget deficit, representing 30 percent of Government spending, to help wring out inflation and create a stable currency that is readily acceptable to Western nations. 'Can't Start in the Middle' **********''This is the first time the Polish Government, indeed any government in Eastern Europe, is pursuing these economic policies, even if they're unpopular,'' said Zuzana Princova, a London-based expert on centrally planned economies with the WEFA Group, a consulting firm. ''You can't start in the middle. You have to start at the beginning, and that's what they're doing. That's very positive.'' **********Still, there are fears that lifting price controls could spark unrest by workers whose wages do not keep pace with inflation. That happened in 1956, 1970, 1976 and 1980 when the Communist Government moved to raise prices. **********But many Poles say they will put up with some inflationary pain this time around, explaining that ''we'' and not ''they,'' meaning the Communists, are now in power. **********And over all, Poles seem to be seeking to send a message to the world that they are ready to swallow a lot of bitter medicine to achieve long-term health. Who Will Do the Firing?  Some economists in Warsaw worry that the Government's crash program will do too little about many other problems plaguing the economy. Poland's years of Communism left thousands of nomenklatura, the managers named by the old regime, some of them incompetent, some of them effective, running the nation's industries. Now the new Government does not know whom to discharge and whom to keep. Nor is it sure whether it should be doing the discharging, or whether it should wait for the companies to become private and let the shareholders do the discharging. **********Complicating matters is that it is often impossible to measure whether Polish companies are profitable. Price controls, subsidies, inflation and sometimes dubious accounting rules all get in the way. **********Many Poles question whether the nation has a class of alternative managers ready to step in to run newly freed companies. Forty years of Communism has taught Poles little about managing competitively. Besides, even before Communist rule, the Poles were largely a peasant society that unlike Germany had not developed an indigenous business class. France and Britain have promised assistance to help train managers. 'Such a Mess' **********''Everything is such a mess that you must build everything from scratch at the same time,'' said Andrzej Wroblewski, editor at Zarzadzanie, a new business magazine. **********One of the biggest messes, everyone agrees, is banking. For years, Poland's state-owned banks would often fork over money to inefficient, money-losing industries. Now, many people are asking, how will Poland, with its lack of commercial banks and basic banking skills, be able to redirect its small supply of capital to enterprises with growth potential? **********Many economists say forming a stock market or selling companies to their managers could raise money. Government officials seem to talk nonstop about attracting foreign capital through joint ventures. But such ideas still depend on finding people with substantial amounts of money to invest. Shortage of Capitalists **********''You can't have capitalism without capitalists,'' said Alec Nove, an economics professor at the University of Glasgow and author of numerous books on socialism. ''In Poland, there aren't many capitalists with private fortunes.'' **********When Government officials start talking about privatization or capitalism to help make the economy more efficient, many Poles grow unenthusiastic. **********''Our people hate Communism, but when you start talking about privatization, many of them act like Communists,'' Mr. Wroblewski said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/world/clamor-east-china-disgust-with-west-reported-but-beijing-ignores-wall-s-end.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1989-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 542, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLAMOR IN THE EAST: China; Disgust With the West Is Reported, But Beijing Ignores the Wall's End", "print_headline": "CLAMOR IN THE EAST: China; Disgust With the West Is Reported, But Beijing Ignores the Wall's End", "body_text": " **********Newspaper readers in China learned of the remarkable resignations of East German leaders this week, but they also picked up another bit of news: two East Germans who had fled more than a month ago to the West found the new society too disorderly and so returned home. **********Chinese official newspapers have regularly, if sparingly, reported the developments within the East German leadership this week.

But they said that the suspension of arms shipments appeared calculated to appeal to American interests. **********The Government has recently taken unusual steps to inform the United States Embassy here of its actions in what diplomats say is a belief that the Bush Administration has tired of the contra problem and may be willing quietly to prepare the way for demobilization of the rebel forces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/09/world/ukraine-intellectuals-lead-challenge-to-communists.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1989-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ukraine Intellectuals Lead Challenge to Communists", "print_headline": "Ukraine Intellectuals Lead Challenge to Communists", "body_text": " **********Ukrainians by the millions turned on their television sets the other night to witness a wondrous sight, a popular Ukrainian literary critic in fiery debate with a senior ideologist from the republic's Communist Party. **********The issue was a recent move by the Ukrainian Writers Union to organize an independent political movement similar to the popular fronts that have attracted mass support in the Baltic republics. **********Viewers rendered a split decision on who prevailed in the televised confrontation, but the event signified an important awakening here in the Soviet Union's second-largest republic: after a period of deceptive quiet, the Ukraine's intellectual establishment has ventured into open conflict with the Communist Party, and Ukrainian nationalism - or patriotism, as its adherents prefer - is becoming respectable. **********Nationalism in the Ukraine, which is the Soviet Union's breadbasket and industrial engine, is surely high on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's list of nightmares as Soviet leader. **********''Here we're not talking about 1.5 million people, as in Estonia, but 50 million, a nation the size of France or Italy,'' noted Bogdan N. Gorin, a leader of the Ukrainian Helsinki Association, a dissident human-rights group. ''We think the question of the Soviet Union, whether it survives or not, will be resolved not in Estonia, but in the Ukraine.'' **********Many in the republic believe that is a major reason the Soviet leader made a hastily arranged five-day tour of the republic in late February. **********A trip through the Ukraine in Mr. Gorbachev's footsteps -from Kiev, the capital, to the cultural center of Lvov in the west, to the industrial city of Donetsk in the east - found that rivulets of discontent have begun running together into a rising stream. **********From the hearty welcome of a Kiev taxicab driver who proudly introduced himself as ''a Ukrainian, and a nationalist,'' to the carefully worded calls for greater autonomy embodied in the platforms of seemingly establishment candidates in the current election campaign, a visitor finds the caution and intimidation that prevailed here a year ago beginning to dissipate. **********In just the last few months, movements for environmental protection, for promotion of Ukrainian language, for the honoring of Stalin's victims, and for the legalization of the outlawed Uniate Catholic Church have all shown signs of vigor. All seem likely to align themselves with the writers' new Popular Movement in Support of Perestroika, called the ''Ruk'' in Ukrainian, which advocates greater political and economic autonomy from Moscow. **********Spreading from Lvov, the center of ferment, to the more establishment intellectual circles of Kiev, those movements are being drawn together now by several factors, including the example of the Baltic republics, the sense that Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the Ukrainian party strongman, is slipping from power, and an election campaign that which has encouraged people to come out and defend themselves.  The Nationalists  3 Sides Pose Challenges **********One tributary of the growing nationalism is the Ukrainian language society named for Taras Shevchenko, the Ukrainian national poet, which started in Lvov, where it now claims 10,000 members, and quickly spread east. **********The group promotes a revival of Ukrainian language and literature, which inevitably means a sense of identity separate from the country's ruling Russian majority. **********Anyone who thought the society was some kind of hobby club for afficianados of Ukrainian poetry learned otherwise at the group's founding conference in Kiev on Feb. 11 and 12. **********Several participants said Ivan F. Drach, a literary critic who is chairman of the Kiev Writers Union, called for the Ukrainian Party ideology chief, Leonid M. Kravchuk, to be taken to court for spreading ''disinformation'' against the writers' attempts to organize. Religious Grievancs **********The Ukrainian authorities must also be concerned about recent signs of cooperation between the outlawed Uniate Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox believers. **********Uniate refers to members of Eastern Christian Churches in union with the Roman Catholic Church but with their own rite. **********Both groups have strong grievances. The Uniates, banned for nationalist tendencies, want legalization and the return of former Catholic churches that have been handed over to the Russian Orthodox Patriarchate in Moscow. **********Ukrainian Orthodox believers want the right to hold services in their language, and some favor creation of a separate orthodox denomination independent from Moscow. Cautiously Worded Platform **********On Feb. 26 a crowd estimated by organizers at 25,000 people thronged outside the Uspenski Cathedral here for a requiem service on the 125th anniversary of the death of the poet Shevchenko. The service was led jointly by the Rev. Mykhailo Neiskoguz, a renegade priest of the Orthodox Church, and the Rev. Mykhailo Voloshyn of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, a demonstration of solidarity that reportedly left many in the crowd weeping with joy. **********The most important recent development is creation of the ''Ruk,'' the popular movement that promises to unite the various strains of Ukrainian patriotism, religious and cultural, dissident and establishment, under a flag of greater independence for the republic. **********The group's draft platform, made available by Mr. Drach, is a more cautiously worded version of the national front declarations that have rallied mass support in the Baltics. **********It calls for Ukrainians to control their natural resources and industry, for religious and political diversity, for a halt to Russification - which the platform describes as ''the raising of little Ivans who don't remember who their kin are.'' Communists' Leading Role **********The group demands the right to submit draft laws, sponsor candidates in the elections and put up questions for popular referendum. **********The Ruk does not favor secession from the union - even the more radical Helsinki association stops short of that - and it is careful to present itself as a supporter of Mr. Gorbachev's economic and political policies rather than as a political alternative. **********Unlike the Baltic popular fronts, the Ruk platform diplomatically ''acknowledges the leading role of the Communist Party.'' **********Mr. Drach, like a majority of Ruk's founders a Communist Party member, is careful to say that the movement is not an opposition political party. Asked about the prospect of a multiparty system eventually, he said: ''In the future, I think it is possible, in a variant like the Hungarian type. The time is not ripe. First we need a popular movement to raise the cultural level.'' Group Assailed as Timid **********Mr. Gorin of the Helsinki association said his group supported the Ruk but considers it overly timid. ''They want the party to shake their hand and say, 'Good for you!' he said. ''The party''s not going to do that.'' **********Indeed, the Ukrainian Party has used its newspapers and officials to wage a fierce campaign against Ruk, variously playing down Ruk as the work of literary dilettantes and denouncing it as a dangerous rival. **********''Rouget de Lisle helped the French Revolution by writing the Marseillaise,'' said the party newspaper Radyanska Ukraina of the writers' effort. ''He did not organize a movement for perestroika in French society.''  The Party Line  The Communists Play Rough **********The hard line of the Communist leadership here is one reason the rise of Ukrainian self-consciousness has been slower than the surge of nationalism in the Baltic republics. **********Many remain intimidated by memories of how the last flowering of Ukrianian cultural nationalism was beaten down by the Kremlin under the leadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev and his chief ideologist, Mikhail A. Suslov. In 1972, a moderate Ukrainian Party leader, Petro Y. Shelest, was purged in favor of Mr. Shcherbitsky, whose main virtue from Moscow's viewpoint has been his ability to keep control. **********To illustrate the pre-glasnost thinking that prevails here, those seeking revisions tell the story of Vasyl Stus, a dissident poet who died in prison in 1985 while serving a 15-year term for anti-Soviet propaganda. **********Hundreds of the poems that were confiscated as evidence that he had done something wrong remain impounded, and family members say the prison refuses to release his ashes until he has ''completed his term.'' 'Down With Shcherbitsky!' **********Ukrainian intellectuals have never liked Mr. Shcherbitsky, but he was a dangerous man to offend. Lately Mr. Drach and other prominent figures have called openly for his retirement, and at various demonstrations and election meetings crowds have broken into lusty chants of ''down with Shcherbitsky!'' **********When Mr. Shcherbitsky was excluded from the list of top party officials allotted guaranteed seats in the new National Congress, many here took it as a confirmation that Mr. Gorbachev is losing patience with Mr. Shcherbitsky, a lukewarm supporter of perestroika. **********''A year ago everyone was afraid of Shcherbitsky,'' said Les Tanyuk, a 50-year-old Kiev writer and theater director. ''But not so much now. They read the Moscow press. They see what is possible.'' **********But even if Mr. Shcherbitsky goes, the Ukraine's conservative tradition presents a problem for Mr. Gorbachev.  Ukrainian Split  The Republic's East-West Rift **********Another reason the Ukraine has remained seemlingly docile is that the republic is split by a deep cultural divide. **********Much of what is now the Soviet Ukraine was part of Kievan Russia, a center of Slavic power in the 9th through 11th centuries. Since then the Ukraine has known only brief periods of independence, in the 17th century and again after the Russian Revolution; otherwise it has been under Mongol, Polish, Lithuanian or Russian rule. Its language, closely related to Russian, was suppressed by the Czars. **********Most of what is now the western part of the republic was part of Poland after World War I, and did not fall under Soviet power until 1939. **********Despite the decimation of Lvov's intellectuals by fascist occupation and Stalin's terror, emigration and Russification, despite the fact that the city's splendid Austro-Hungarian architecture has gone shabby under Soviet neglect, Lvov today cherishes its roots. **********By contrast, Soviet power took hold in the eastern Ukraine in 1919, and places like Donetsk are now fully assimilated into the Russian melting pot. **********Only half the people of Donetsk, an industrial city in the Donbas region, are Ukrainian, and many of them speak Russian with their children. **********While 95 percent of the schools in Lvov teach in Ukrainian, not one in Donetsk does.  The Changes  Dissidents Look To Gorbachev **********The current campaign to elect a new National Congress of Deputies has contributed to the revival here by energizing public debate and forcing established figures to declare their views. Some people well within the bounds of official approval have drafted campaign platforms that closely resemble Ruk's program. **********The advocates of greater independence said they took heart from Mr. Gorbachev's visit. **********On his last day in Kiev, the Soviet leader gathered nine writers, including Mr. Drach and other prominent figures in the Ukrainian revival, and charmed them by reciting bits of Ukrainian poetry. Endorsements by Gorbachev **********Mr. Drach and another writer who was present said the Soviet leader had endorsed the idea of raising the status of Ukrainian language and culture, but coupled this with a friendly plea to avoid devisiveness. **********Immediately after Mr. Gorbachev left for Moscow, the campaign against Ukrainian nationalism resumed with arrests and fresh attacks in the press. But many Ukrainians say the thing holding them back now is not ruthless authority as much as a long period of numbness. **********The other day a young Ukrainian, a Uniate Catholic and a supporter of the Popular Movement, strolled through the streets here with a visiting American, comparing the slow stirring of Ukrainian consciousness with the more vibrant politics across the Polish border, 50 miles away. **********''In Poland, when people were beaten they got angry and fought back,'' he said. ''Here, people have been beaten and beaten until they don't feel anything anymore.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/15/business/talking-deals-busch-proposes-a-hockey-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Joshua Mills", "pub_date": "1989-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 928, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals; Busch Proposes A Hockey Trade", "print_headline": "Talking Deals; Busch Proposes A Hockey Trade", "body_text": " **********THE Anheuser-Busch Companies has offered St. Louis an unusual deal. In return for the right to demolish 10 turn-of-the-century landmark warehouses adjacent to Busch Stadium, Anheuser-Busch would build an 18,000-seat arena for the St. Louis Blues hockey team, buy the team and promise to keep it in St. Louis. **********The latter is no small matter in a city that last season lost its National Football League team, the Cardinals, which moved to Phoenix. The city's National Basketball Association team, the Hawks, moved to Atlanta in 1967. **********Under Anheuser-Busch's proposal, the new arena would be developed by the Civic Center Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary that owns Busch Stadium, as well as the surrounding parking lots and some hotel and office buildings nearby. The new arena is likely to cost $60 million to $65 million to build, said Michael F. Shanahan, the chairman of the Blues. **********The proposed deal would seem to offer Busch potential benefits on several fronts. The company has enjoyed stunning box office success with the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team, which it has owned since 1953. The Blues are currently the only other professional team in town. Anheuser-Busch would get whatever profits the team turns, an arena in which to sell and promote its products, the promotional value of the franchise and the good will from assuring that the team will not move. **********The arena would provide revenue from parking, concessions, advertising inside the arena and from the rental of luxury boxes that corporate and other ticket holders use for entertainment. The hockey team would provide an anchor tenant, but Anheuser-Busch would have a new building for college basketball, rock concerts, wrestling, rodeos, tractor pulls and other events. **********Anheuser-Busch ''is among the leaders in sponsoring sports teams,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage industry analyst with Paine Webber Inc. Noting the extensive participation of the company in auto and boat racing, as well as its sponsorship of national radio broadcasts of major league baseball, he said, ''In sports promotion, Anheuser-Busch is pervasive.'' **********Anheuser Busch would not be the first brewer to own a hockey team. The Molson Companies of Canada owns the Montreal Canadiens. **********Anheuser-Busch, which owns Busch Stadium, where its baseball team plays, already holds $1 million worth of limited partnership shares in the Blues. Last month, it reached an agreement in principle to buy a controlling interest in the team, in the form of the general partnership shares owned by Mr. Shanahan, who would retain a limited partnership and continue as chief executive. **********Mr. Shanahan, 49 years old, is chairman of Engineered Support Systems Inc., a military contractor based in Olivette, Mo. In 1986, he led a group of investors, including the Southwestern Bell Corporation and the Emerson Electric Company, that bought the Blues from Harry Ornest, an investor from Beverly Hills, Calif. **********In buying Mr. Shanahan's general partnership shares, Anheuser-Busch would put up a still-to-be-decided amount of money and would also assume the Blues' debt. Mr. Shanahan said the debt ''was close to zero.'' Busch would also be responsible for any operating losses incurred by the Blues, which made a modest profit last season. **********But the deal faces several hurdles. First, it must be submitted to the city's Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority, which will be asked to grant the 11.3-acre site the same tax abatement that Civic Center has on its stadium properties. **********Jeff Wehling, a Civic Center spokesman, said the authority would probably receive the Busch proposal later this month. If the authority approves it, the deal then goes to the city's Board of Aldermen. If the board approves it, the city's Heritage and Urban Design Commission would have to rule on the request to demolish the warehouses. **********How that request might fare is unclear. Kathleen Shea, the agency's commissioner, declined to discuss the issue before the land clearance authority issues a ruling. **********The warehouses, some of which are still in use, are known as Cupples Station and are southwest of Busch Stadium. Civic Center agreed in March to pay Washington University in St. Louis $9 million for the property. **********A month later, Mr. Shanahan approached Civic Center and proposed that it buy the hockey team as well. He said he had two goals, to reduce his liabilities and to help the Blues find a new home that would bring them greater revenue. **********''It became apparent to me that in order for the Blues to become one of the top four to six teams in the league, we'd have to make substantial investments in player development,'' Mr. Shanahan said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''That meant we would need to share in arena revenue.'' **********He said 19 of the National Hockey League's 21 teams share the revenue from arena parking, concessions and advertising. The Blues, which currently play in the St. Louis Arena, which was built in 1929 and is owned by the city, do not. **********The current arena is expensive to maintain because of its age, and its parking lots cannot accommodate the crowds, he said. What is more, views from many seats leave something to be desired."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/business/a-shift-in-mexico-with-airline-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1989-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Shift in Mexico With Airline Sale", "print_headline": "A Shift in Mexico With Airline Sale", "body_text": " **********Stepping up its efforts to diminish the state's role in the economy, the Mexican Government announced today that it would sell its majority share in Mexicana de Aviacion, the country's leading airline, and that foreign investors would be encouraged to acquire a minority stake in the flag carrier. **********The Government, which owns 58 percent of Mexicana and tried unsuccessfully last year to sell the airline to private Mexican investors, said that under a change in the law foreigners are now eligible to own up to 100 percent of Mexicana through 20-year ''temporary trusts.'' But officials quickly added that Mexicana's management wants foreigners only in a minority role. Until new regulations on foreign investment were published last week, commercial aviation was one of several sectors of the economy reserved for the state and for Mexican nationals. **********American and Japanese investors are rumored here to be interested in acquiring a share of Mexicana, which had revenues of $764 million in 1988. While an infusion of foreign capital would help plans to modernize and expand the airline's fleet and ground services, letting control of the carrier pass from Mexican hands would be politically controversial. Utility Privatization Might Be Next **********Since 1982, the Government program to reduce the size of the state sector has resulted in the sale, closing or merger of more than 700 Government-owned companies. With Mexicana now on the block, the next move expected of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is to open utilities like the state telephone company to private investment, both domestic and foreign. **********Today's announcement also marks the opening of a new and more advanced phase in a sweeping airline deregulation and privatization program begun by the Government a year ago. **********Already, the program has dramatically improved service here. On May 12, for example, Mexicana began daily nonstop service from here to New York. It had sought the route for more than 30 years but had been thwarted by bureaucratic meddling. **********At the same time, Mexico and the United States both stand to benefit from a newly revised commercial air agreement that significantly increases access for airlines in each country to markets in the other. Passengers in both countries are likely to see greater flexibility in schedules and fares. And more than a dozen airlines that fly between the two countries anticipate increased profitability, which would allow them to move ahead with planned fleet expansions and modernization. **********''Many more companies will now be flying between Mexico and the United States as a result of this agreement,'' said Eduardo Eggleton, commercial director for Mexicana, which has a 40 percent share of airline traffic between the countries. ''It means greater competition for us, but it also means we have more routes to exploit.'' **********The new air agreement, which replaces a far more limited accord in effect for a decade, was signed last September after two years of negotiations. But airlines in both countries needed time to study the commercial prospects for possible new routes and then to find the aircraft available to fly them. So the full impact of the accord is only now starting to be felt. **********Availing themselves of the new openings, United States airlines have in recent months begun service on more than 24 new flights and routes to Mexico, including Dallas-Monterrey, Chicago-Puerto Vallarta and Raleigh-Durham-Cancun. **********By the summer, increased competition is also expected on established and heavily traveled routes like San Francisco-Mexico City and Chicago-Mexico City. 'Both Countries Are Better Off' **********United, Delta, American and other airlines are stepping up their service to and from Mexico, emphasizing connections through their hubs in the United States and service on to Europe and the Far East. The agreement also opens possibilities for air charter service that both American and Mexican companies are rushing to exploit. **********''Thanks to the expanded routes, the consumer is better off, the tourism industry is better off and both countries are better off,'' said a diplomat here who specializes in transportation issues. ''A conservative estimate is that by December we are going to have seen a million additional passengers, just on American carriers.'' **********Mexico is likely to benefit even more from the liberalized airline accord, and not simply because the bulk of the traffic between the countries consists of American tourists bound for Mexican resorts. Mexico's two national carriers, which in the past carried 60 percent of the traffic between the two countries, hope to maintain their dominant position by breaking into new markets, like San Jose in Northern California, while expanding their service to airports in cities like Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla. Changes for Mexicana **********Mexicana officials said their company was for many years prevented from flying to New York by the Mexican Government, which wanted to reserve the lucrative route for Aeromexico, the weaker of Mexico's two state-owned airlines. It was only after Aeromexico's bankruptcy and reorganization as a private company last year that Mexicana won route approval from the Government, by now an ardent proponent of airline competition. **********With inflation down strikingly in Mexico, air fares are holding steady, and both domestic traffic and revenues are up as a result. At its annual shareholders meeting last month, Mexicana announced 1988 profits of more than $136 million and declared a 2-for-1 stock split. **********Mexicana had operated at a loss in 1985 and 1986, and in 1987 it barely broke even. The airline's president, Manuel Sosa de la Vega, told stockholders at the April meeting that ''the intention of the Government is to sell'' Mexicana to private investors this year. Aeromexico Flourishes **********After getting rid of more than a third of its 45 planes and laying off about three-quarters of a work force of more than 12,000 people, the smaller but reinvigorated Aeromexico is also flourishing under private ownership. More than 90 percent of its arrivals are on time, and on-board service has visibly improved, winning respect from passengers who formerly derided the company as ''Error Mexico.'' **********Many of the routes Aeromexico discarded as unprofitable have been picked up by regional airlines that see them as a basis for growth. Regional carriers like AeroCalifornia are so confident in the new climate that they have not hesitated to go up against Mexicana or Aeromexico on some routes, offering more convenient schedules and personalized service. **********''This is just the beginning of what civil aviation can become in Mexico,'' said AeroCalifornia's president, Raul Antonio Arechiga. ''With this opening, the monopoly of state enterprises has been broken, along with the rigidity in strategies of operation that has for so long held back the development of commercial aviation in Mexico.'' New Routes for AeroCalifornia **********AeroCalifornia has already been authorized to fly its first international routes, between Los Angeles and Loreto and Los Cabos, and expects to begin service late this month. Mr. Arechiga said that by the end of the year, both his four-plane fleet and 700-member work force will have more than doubled, positioning the airline for what he expects to be a further opening of the market. **********''Once the Government sells off Mexicana, then it will only be regulating, not operating, commercial aviation in Mexico,'' he said. ''That will give us greater flexibility, and we will be able to make even more decisions on our own.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/world/apartheid-foes-are-tear-gassed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apartheid Foes Are Tear-Gassed", "print_headline": "Apartheid Foes Are Tear-Gassed", "body_text": " **********The police fired tear gas today into a church hall where four recently released anti-apartheid campaigners were about to give speeches.

Despite the order's general wording, market professionals said it was aimed at one of Europe's largest grain traders, Gruppo Ferruzzi S.p.A. of Italy. Ferruzzi is a member of the Board of Trade. **********The board acted, these professionals said, after American grain merchants contended that Ferruzzi U.S.A., the concern's American arm, had cornered the market, buying up both soybean futures contracts and soybeans themselves to the point that it controlled those markets. It could then extract unfairly large profits from others who traded in those markets. **********Ferruzzi responded angrily that the Board of Trade's order was ''taken in disregard to the true economics of the marketplace'' and that the emergency action was ''premature.'' **********That Ferruzzi would criticize the exchange publicly was itself unusual. A clubby institution, the exchange has long frowned on members who complain out loud. **********Because of the complex laws and requirements surrounding commodities trading, it is expected to remain unclear for some time whether the moves by the Italian concern were an attempt to corner the soybean market or simply a legitimate effort by Ferruzzi, one of the world's largest soybean processors, to insure that it had an adequate supply of the commodity. **********The exchange gave no reason when it issued the order. In an interview, however, Raymond Carmichael, an exchange spokesman, pointed to the development of conditions in recent weeks that could have led to a financial debacle had the exchange not acted. **********In particular, the number of open soybean contracts stood at an abnormally high 6,943 on Tuesday, only nine days before the July contract was to expire.

A corner occurs when a trader holds more contracts to buy a commodity than the sellers can acquire to honor their delivery commitments. That so many soybean contracts remained outstanding on Tuesday indicated to some exchange members that whoever held them was trying to corner the market. **********The price of the July soybean contract had been surging in recent weeks, indicating that few were being put up for sale. **********It was this situation that the emergency order was meant to address. The exchange was concerned about impending chaos in the market, a situation in which people who had sold soybean futures contracts obligating them to deliver soybeans would have no way to make good on that obligation. Prohibition to Members **********At issue is whether the conditions the exchange was addressing in the order resulted from an intentional attempt to corner the market. Exchange rules prohibit members from making such attempts. The Board of Trade tries to enforce this rule by barring any one member from holding more than 600 contracts due to expire in a given month. The exchange has spent millions of dollars in recent years for computers to monitor the market to detect possible violations. **********The result of the order was dramatic. At the closing bell, the July contract had lost 5.4 percent of its value in frenzied trading, finishing at $6.86 a bushel, down 39.4 cents. Each contract represents 5,000 bushels. Because the contract is in its final month of trading, the price was allowed to drop beyond the Board of Trade's normal daily limit of 30 cents a bushel. **********In a press release issued from its New Orleans headquarters, Ferruzzi U.S.A. confirmed that for more than a year it had been accumulating positions in the soybean market. But it said the accumulation was undertaken for legitimate business reasons, so the group could ''assure the uninterrupted operation of its processing plants, including Central Soya's facilities, and to satisfy export commitments, particularly to the Soviet Union.'' Protein Additive **********Central Soya is an American processor that the Italian company acquired in 1987. Soybeans are used as a protein additive to fatten cattle, and in limited ways in some food for human beings. Ferruzzi added, ''This accumulation was accomplished over several months and was done openly and in accordance with all applicable Chicago Board of Trade reporting rules and regulations.'' **********Market professionals who were interviewed said the Board of Trade's concern was that the majority of obligations to deliver soybeans were to Ferruzzi. That created an unfair situation, the American professionals said, in which Ferruzzi could have extracted higher and higher prices from the desperate people who were contractually obliged to deliver soybeans or buy back contracts. **********William Viederman, director of research at Allendale Inc., a commodities firm in Crystal Lake, outside Chicago, declined to comment on the current situation. But he said that ''a couple of large commercial entities began stockpiling soybeans and soybean futures 16 months ago.'' He said the intent of these companies was not to corner the market but to insure for themselves an adequate amount of soybeans in the face of dwindling supplies. Member Complaints **********''By having an inventory that they could offer at a price better than competitors' prices, they achieved higher market share,'' Mr. Viederman said. **********He said the Board of Trade first began looking into the matter when a number of exchange members complained that the futures positions being amassed in soybeans could not be justified by the economics and were in violation of exchange rules. In particular, exchange rules prohibit a member from accepting delivery of a commodity under a futures contract when that commodity can be bought for less outside the exchange, in the ''cash market.'' That condition - cash prices being less than futures prices - has prevailed for some time. **********Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator for the commodities market, had been on watch for months about possible disruptions in the soybean market because of poor crop conditions at the end of the year. Such conditions could lead a company to attempt to amass large quantities of soybeans and soybean futures to meet orders. **********John Mielke, associate director of surveillance at the C.F.T.C., said the agency was alerted to the possibility of problems once the supply of soybeans began to drop. ''Our antenna was up a long time ago,'' Mr. Mielke said. He added that the emergency order by the Board of Trade was issued after efforts to gain voluntary cooperation failed. Move Not Unprecedented **********Commodities lawyers said yesterday that while the use of emergency action by an exchange was unusual, it was not unprecedented. **********Thomas A. Russo, a commodities and securities lawyer with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, who wrote the rules regarding emergency actions when he worked for the C.F.T.C., said today that ''an exchange doesn't have to know there is a manipulation going on before it takes emergency action.'' **********The rules can come into play when any large position may affect the performance of a contract traded on an exchange. **********''The broad scope of emergency power was intended to give exchanges flexibility to deal with any circumstance which could affect performance of futures and options contracts, even where those circumstances fall short of manipulative activity,'' Mr. Russo said. **********Government officials and commodities lawyers said any effort at proving manipulation would be difficult, and would take a number of years. **********Under the case law that has developed, the Government would have to prove that there was a manipulative action and an intent to manipulate and that artificial prices were set by the manipulator. **********Officials of the Board of Trade evidently had still other concerns that conditions might be ripe for the market to be cornered. **********For instance, the number of open contracts in the July soybean futures contract could be considered as as obligations to deliver some 34 million bushels of soy. Yet, at present, depots in Toledo and Chicago have only about 13 million bushels of soybeans on hand. These are the only two depots where Board of Trade members can make delivery. **********Moreover, people who follow soy prices closely noted today that the beans have been selling in the Gulf of Mexico, a leading export center for this crop, at 5 cents a bushel below the price at the Board of Trade. It costs an additional 25 cents to 30 cents to ship beans from Chicago or Toledo to the Gulf. So Ferruzzi is likely to be asked why it maintained such a large position at the commodity exchange here when it could have bought the beans for less at the Gulf."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/20/business/company-news-at-t-to-reduce-long-distance-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 405, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T. to Reduce Long-Distance Rates", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; A.T.&T. to Reduce Long-Distance Rates", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced today that it would reduce rates by 1.3 to 2 percent on interstate and international long-distance services used primarily by residential and small-business customers. **********The price reductions will take effect Jan. 1, A.T.& T. said.

The Japan Fair Trade Commission has also opened an inquiry. **********Japanese officials mostly seem to be concerned by the prospect that the disclosures will bolster one of Washington's biggest trade complaints: that Japanese companies will endure huge losses in the short run if they think they can block competitors from the market over the long run - although the competition in the current case was domestic. **********Indeed, in Washington on Wednesday, a Bush Administration trade official said the Fujitsu case illustrated a practice the United States was pointing to when it cited Japan for trade irregularities in May under the 1988 Trade and Competitiveness Act. **********The United States complained that it had been effectively denied access to the Japanese public sector market in supercomputers because of Japanese business practices that lock out foreign competition. **********In negotiations on so-called structural impediments to freer trade between the two countries, the United States has also singled out collusive business practices in Japan, including bid rigging, price fixing, market allocation and group boycotts. **********In the Japanese press, Fujitsu has been harshly criticized. The Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest newspapers, said in an editorial this morning, ''It is about time Japanese business leaders realized that the Japanese way of using any means to expand one's market share is no longer considered acceptable by the rest of the world.'' **********''Fujitsu's attitude was typically Japanese,'' the newspaper said, attacking the company's handling of the disclosures. ''Instead of discussion what was wrong about the bidding price of 1 yen, the company merely copped out by offering to give up the contracts.'' Criticism Invited **********By the end of the day, Fujitsu's president, Takuma Yamamoto, was summoned to the ministry for a sharp rebuke and a warning that the company was ''inviting international criticism'' of Japanese business practices that were ''ethically questionable,'' and perhaps illegal. **********The company's remarkably low bids were apparently intended to insure that Fujitsu won contracts to design municipal computer systems throughout Japan. Once the contract was in hand, the company would then design the systems to operate only with Fujitsu equipment, thus locking out other Japanese computer makers and providing high profits on subsequent hardware and software sales. **********Such tactics closely parallel the kind of practices that American companies contend have blocked them from entering the Japanese market, particularly in supercomputers. 'We Told You So' **********''People are starting to say 'Ah ha, we told you so,' '' said John Stern, who represents American electronics companies in Tokyo and who has been one of the leading critics of Japanese trading practices. By coincidence, the next negotiations on such invisible barriers in the distribution system begin Monday in Washington. **********On Japanese television tonight, where the suspicious bids have become a big story, a broadcaster on one station said, with some surprise in his voice: ''The United States has been telling us that Japanese business practices hinder competition. What we are seeing here may lend some credence to that view.'' **********The trade ministry appears to fear the same thing. As details of the case trickled out today, reports of a similar case involving the NEC Corporation came to light, and officials of the ministry began drafting a warning to the computer industry to end such bidding techniques immediately. **********''It violates healthy competitive order,'' said Tetsuo Natsui, the deputy director of the Electronics Policy Bureau of the ministry. ''But I think we could also lose international credibility.'' $78,000 for Less Than a Penny The Fujitsu disclosures started last week, when a newspaper in Hiroshima reported that Fujitsu bid one yen, about three quarters of a penny, on a contract to design a system for the city's waterworks department. Fujitsu, embarrassed by the publicity, has since tried to abandon the contract, which involves an estimated $78,000 in work with much larger purchases later. **********At a news conference earlier today, Mr. Yamamoto disclosed that in at least two other cases, in two other prefectures, Fujitsu won with one-yen bids. He said the actions ''defied common sense.'' In another case, a contract was won with a bid of 10,000 yen, or about $71. **********Reversing Fujitsu's statements on Tuesday, Mr. Yamamoto also said that some members of the company's headquarters staff might have known about the bids. **********Acknowledging that the case could undercut Japan's negotiating positions with the United States, Mr. Yamamoto apologized for ''giving trouble to the Japanese people,'' and he said he feared the disclosures might add ''considerable stress to the current situation.'' The United States has filed a trade complaint against Japan, contending that deep discounts on supercomputers are intended to freeze out Americans. Old Dispute With I.B.M. The disclosures have become the biggest embarrassment for Fujitsu since it was accused seven years ago of stealing crucial software codes from the International Business Machines Corporation. **********Last year, Fujitsu was ordered to pay I.B.M. $395.9 million for a license for past and future use of several disputed programs, but I.B.M. was required to set up a way to assure Fujitsu access to new programs the company would need to continue to make I.B.M.-compatible equipment. **********One mystery in the current cases is why Fujitsu felt that it was so vital to win the contracts. The company's growth has been stunning in recent times, even as foreign competitors run into an industry downturn. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 1989, were $18.09 billion, up nearly 17 percent, and net income was $529 million, up 65 percent. **********Mr. Yamamoto, a veteran pilot of the Imperial Air Force during World War II whose forceful manner has made him one of the best-known and most feared Japanese business executives, also said that at times Fujitsu would continue to bid below its costs to win contracts. **********He said that did not mean the company would again offer one-yen bids. ''It's a matter of degree,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/business/in-shift-us-eases-computer-exports-to-eastern-bloc.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1989-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1285, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN SHIFT, U.S. EASES COMPUTER EXPORTS TO EASTERN BLOC", "print_headline": "IN SHIFT, U.S. EASES COMPUTER EXPORTS TO EASTERN BLOC", "body_text": " **********In a shift in American export policy, the Commerce Department announced today that it planned to allow the sale of a broad range of personal computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern-bloc nations. **********The department said that its action reflected the Administration's desire to expand trade with Eastern European nations. The announcement was made as President Bush returned from a foreign trip that included stops in Poland and Hungary. **********The action will allow American companies to sell more up-to-date desktop computers, those generally built in the mid-1980's, while maintaining controls on the most sophisticated systems. Older models of limited capability can already be exported under an earlier relaxation of controls. Curbs on Advanced Lines **********For example, the new rules would mean that Apple Computer Inc., one of the nation's largest makers of personal computers, could now sell the low end of its well-known Macintosh line, and the International Business Machines Corporation, the nation's biggest maker, could sell the most basic of its new PS/2 line. **********But the more advanced members of the Macintosh and PS/2 lines, which are based on more powerful semiconductor chips, would still be restricted. Until now, Apple has been able to sell only its Apple II line, developed in the 1970's, and I.B.M. its original PC line, marketed in 1981, to the Soviet bloc. **********Commerce said its action was justified because models similar to those banned by the United States have been freely sold to the Eastern bloc from other countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, India and Brazil. Exaggeration Is Seen **********The computer industry applauded the Administration's decision. But some former Pentagon officials sharply criticized the move, which they said was based on an exaggeration of the availability of computers around the world and would benefit the Soviet military. **********''It would be foolish of us to sit on something when it is not state of the art and is available all over the world,'' Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, said in a telephone interview. ''It is going to give American companies a chance to sell an awful lot of computers around the world.'' **********Representatives of computer industry groups hailed the action as a step in the right direction, while urging even more liberal export controls. **********Ed Black, vice president and general counsel of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the relaxation would give American companies access to a new and potentially large market. ''There are potentially real big dollars out there,'' he added. **********William Maxwell, vice president for international issues for the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, welcomed the move as a ''positive development'' that would help the 17-nation group that sets controls on exports of high-technology items to Communist countries - the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom - reach agreement on the scope of controls on computer exports to the Soviet bloc. **********American companies sold a about six million desktop computers in 1988, the Commerce Department said. About 2.7 million of these were sold outside of the United States, representing more than $1 billion in exports. **********The Commerce Department today announced two actions to loosen American controls on computer exports to both the West and to Eastern nations. Change on Data Rate **********It adopted more liberal standards on the data processing rate of computers that can be exported to other Western nations without an export license. Under the Commerce Department action, the level will increase to 68 million bits per second, from 6.5 million, a bit being a single character of information. An Administration official said this would eliminate the licensing requirement for computers whose technology was predominant in the mid-1980's, while preserving controls on more sophisticated computer equipment. **********The department also said the United States will ask Cocom to permit the direct export to Soviet-bloc nations of computers with the higher data processing rate of 68 million bits per second. Cocom is to take up the question of personal computers at a meeting that began this week. **********Cocom members are expected to back the Administration decision because they generally favor even greater liberalization of export controls on the sale of computers than that now proposed by the Commerce Department, American officials said. Wrangling Within Administration **********The department's move followed months of wrangling within the Bush Administration as the Pentagon sought to limit the scope of the action, officials said. **********The Commerce Department, in response to concerns of the American computer industry, reviewed the ''availability'' of personal computers to Soviet-bloc nations from foreign sources. It concluded that American export controls on desktop computers were not effective in depriving those nations of such systems. **********The department said in a statement that these types of computers were available from ''many uncontrolled sources in newly industrializing countries'' and were even assembled in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Such computers are available in 11 countries and from 70 vendors outside of Cocom countries, Mr. Mosbacher said. **********Stephen D. Bryen, a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy during the Reagan Administration, said, however, that the Commerce Department analysis was ''full of holes.'' For example, he said, the Commerce Department exaggerated the significance of computer assembly plants in Czechoslovakia, which he said produce only a small supply of computers. **********The Commerce Department actions will not lift export controls on some sophisticated types of computers and on portable ''laptop'' computers. Pentagon officials reportedly argued that laptops were not freely available on the world market and therefore should not be decontrolled. Companies See Other Barriers **********The relaxation comes at a time when the Soviet Union has been trying to increase dramatically its use of computers. Still, computer companies, while welcoming the moves, said the export restrictions were only one obstacle to increased sales of machines to the Soviet Union. **********The Soviet Union has expressed a desire to have 20 million personal computers in use by the mid-1990's, compared to an estimated 300,000 today, said Lee Felsenstein, president of Glav-PC, a Berkeley, Calif., company that is trying to set up a trade center in the Soviet Union to train people in using computers. **********David J. Barram, vice president of corporate affairs for Apple, called the development ''a nice step in making the industry more competitive with the rest of the world.'' He said, however, that it would not have much effect on Apple. **********Even if restrictions were lifted on exports to the Eastern bloc, he said, Apple would have a problem providing service and support for machines sold there. In addition, the Soviet-bloc countries have had difficulty coming up with hard currency to pay for computers. **********For Apple, the new rules would mean that it could sell its Macintosh Plus and Macintosh SE, both of which are based on Motorola Inc.'s 68000 microprocessor. But the Macintosh II and IIx, which are based on more powerful Motorola microprocessors, would still be restricted. **********Robert Beach, a spokesman for the Compaq Computer Corporation in Houston, said: ''We are pleased to see that the regulations have been relaxed. It's good any time these things are done.'' But like Apple, the Compaq official said that ''we don't see any great impact on Compaq in the near term.'' Compaq's product line has migrated to the Intel 80386 processor, which is still restricted. ''We would welcome further relaxation to include 386 machines,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/01/world/south-african-detective-is-held-in-2-killings.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1989-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South African Detective Is Held in 2 Killings", "print_headline": "South African Detective Is Held in 2 Killings", "body_text": " **********The South African police disclosed today that they are holding a former narcotics detective in connection with the killings this year of two whites who were prominent in the struggle against apartheid. **********The police implied in a statement issued in Pretoria that the suspect may be part of a conspiracy. **********One of the slain whites, David Webster, a lecturer at the University of Witwatersrand, was shot on May 1 from a passing car in front of his house in Troyville, a Johannesburg suburb.

Rebuilt and repopulated three years ago, this bullet-pocked town is a tiny island of peace amid the waves of war lashing the country. **********In what amounts to a daily celebration of an agreement prohibiting either side from using the town for military purposes, the woman's 16-year-old son now plays soccer with other youths in Tenancingo's central park. Unlike other Salvadoran teen-agers, they are unafraid of army recruiters who forcibly pluck males as young as 12 off the streets of most other rural municpalities. **********But Tenancingo also serves to underscore the growing chasm fueling the civil war, which has displaced more than one in 10 Salvadorans and claimed 70,000 lives, most of them civilians killed by the security forces and allied death squads. 'There's So Much Hate' **********''So many mothers have lost children; so many children have lost parents,'' said one of the town's most successful businessmen, who returned three years ago with the first group of 30 families that repopulated the town. ''There's so much hate. Neither the Government, nor the army, nor the guerrillas can erase that.'' **********Few places define the history of the war as well as Tenancingo, a 20-mile, 90-minute drive northeast of San Salvador. Until six years ago, it was a pastel-painted town of 2,500, the prosperous commercial center of a poor agricultural region. **********In a pattern repeated across much of the country, it was populated largely by landless peasants, many of whom supported the guerrillas, but was run by a coalition of the army, pro-Government property owners and small-business men. **********The rebels attacked the town's 400-man National Guard post on Sept. 25, 1983. In what has become a day of infamy for the Salvadoran armed forces, the air force responded with more than five hours of continuous bombing of civilian targets. About 120 people, or almost one in 20 residents, were killed. Survivors were soon forced to abandon what remained of the town, little more than rows of jagged walls, oversized headstones for the rotting bodies buried under tons of rubble. **********The first group of 30 families returned in January 1986 under an agreement that created a demilitarized zone in the heart of a combat area. Under the pact, which was widely hailed as setting a precedent for cooperation and rural development, the army and the guerrillas could pass through, but were prohibited from maintaining a permanent presence. **********Trying to redress the social and economic disparities that had divided the town, the Roman Catholic Church, which mediated the agreement, also arranged for the Salvadoran Foundation for Development and Minimum Housing, an independent, nonprofit charity known as Fundasal, to help with reconstruction and provide low-cost agricultural loans. Accord Reportedly Violated **********But human rights monitors reported that both sides soon violated the agreement repeatedly. This year, as part of a national campaign against the central Government's authority, the guerrillas threatened the life of the mayor, forcing her to flee; the army has bombed and machine-gunned outlying districts several times, residents said. A firefight last month killed one guerrilla and two soldiers, they added. Both sides appear to have networks of informers and to have assassinated opponents. **********''There are always people with tongues longer than their ties,'' said a Tenancingo native who has had at least one family member killed by both sides. ''This war is getting worse. It creates unemployment. And that creates hunger and more war.'' **********The futility of relief efforts is starkly illustrated by a sewing cooperative that was started in February with grants from the Dutch and Belgian Governments. Forty women are taking classes, learning to make stuffed animals and children's clothes. But their products, which must be priced at $5 to pay for the raw materials, are too expensive for most Salvadorans. So the cooperative has been unable to find a steady market for its wares, said the teacher, Maria Juana Vasquez. **********Despite Fundasal's aid, the town remains divided between rich and poor. A block south of main street, which is lined by relatively prosperous businesses, 11 members of the Cruz family live in a borrowed 30-by-10-foot house. **********They sleep three to a cot and two to a hammock. They do not have electricity or running water. None of the eight children attend school because the family cannot afford the 20 cents a month it costs for supplies. They farm two acres of rocky soil, but must sell most of their harvest to pay the rent on the land and other unavoidable costs like seed, fertilizer and insecticide. The grain-storage bin is empty and the family, which needs 60 tortillas a day, does not know how it will get enough food to survive until the October harvest. 'No Money for Medicine' **********''When we hurt, there's no money for medicine,'' said Maria Paula Cruz, the 43-year-old matriarch of the clan. **********A local health worker said many of the area's children suffer from malnutrition and parasites, spread by contaminated drinking water. She noted that most boys are forced to leave school to work in the fields. One seventh-grade class, for instance, has seven girls but only two boys. **********But the Cruzes, who have been forced by the war to move three times in the last three years, are relatively lucky. Unlike many Salvadorans, they live in a safe haven, have a temporary house, a piece of land and some credit. But Mrs. Cruz noted that they survive only because of the generosity of their landlord, who lends them the house. They could not afford even a minimal rent. **********Mrs. Cruz's husband, Eleno, fished the receipt for seed and fertilizer from a battered cigarette box. The more the family works, he said, the deeper it slides into debt. **********''It's permanent servitude,'' said a friend of the Cruzes, a town leader who actively supports the guerrillas. ''You have to sell what you need in order to survive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/business/introductions-from-apple.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Introductions From Apple", "print_headline": "Introductions From Apple", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. today introduced a number of communications products for the Macintosh personal computer. **********The products include enhancements to the Appletalk network system; products for integrating the Macintosh with other computer systems, including those of the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation, and a range of communications tools for software developers. **********Donald Casey, Apple's vice president of networking and communications, said the new products meet industry communications standards and strengthen Apple's offerings for information access and management. **********In the United States Apple will offer distribution and support for these new products through specially trained networking and communications dealers and so-called value-added resellers.

Buildings were a mass of shattered bricks and twisted iron bars, and several were charred by fire. The air was saturated with dust, smoke and the smell of gunpowder. **********These were the marks of thousands of artillery and mortar shells as well as rockets that rained down for two days in the newest round of bitter confrontation. The savage fighting is between Christian troops, backed by Iraq, and Syrian forces, aligned with Muslim and leftist militias. Casualty Tolls Rising **********Newspapers today listed 18 people killed on Monday; 35 were wounded, many of them suffering from breathing difficulties after inhaling smoke from fires all around them. **********Until early today, heavy shelling of residential areas of Beirut and the neighboring mountains kept people pinned down in underground shelters, many without electricity or water. Today, the fighting abated and was limited to the shelling of Suk al Gharb, a village in the mountains eight miles east of Beirut, where Druse and Christian forces confront each other. **********The lull allowed a resumption of the stream of Lebanese heading south from West Beirut, the Muslim sector of the capital, and the southern suburbs; 250,000 to 300,000 people are said to have fled since the latest fighting flared last month. At least two-thirds are originally from the south and had fled to Beirut for refuge from the fighting in southern Lebanon over the last seven years. **********Virtually all routes out of East Beirut are cut off, however, so the Christian population has no choice but to wait out the siege. **********A police official said the death toll since the bombardment began on March 14 was nearing 300. ''It is a war from stationary positions, with warring gunners firing from field artillery, mortars and rocket launchers against the opposite side,'' the official said, adding that civilians are caught in the crossfire. **********This morning, ambulances evacuated 70 wounded people from West Beirut to the port of Sidon, 25 miles south of here. From there, they were transported by boat to the French Navy hospital ship La Rance, anchored 10 miles offshore. French Rescue Effort **********The evacuation is part of a French relief operation under which a few Christians have already been evacuated and medical supplies delivered to Beirut. The patients today were seen off by Selim al-Hoss, prime minister in an interim Muslim cabinet, and Bernard Kouchner, the French secretary for humanitarian aid. **********The Muslim side agreed to cooperate after the French Government insisted that it was not partial to the Christians. **********Mr. Hoss sent a delegation to Damascus today to urge the Syrian Government to rush flour to Lebanese Muslim areas that have virtually run out of bread. Blockades by both sides have kept all imported supplies at very low levels. **********Even if flour becomes available, there is no electricity to run the bakeries. The state electricity authority announced two days ago it had run out of fuel for its grid and was therefore unable to provide the public with any electricity. Faucets have run dry after city water stopped flowing; there is no power to operate the pumps. **********The cost of bottled water has increased by 50 percent, as have the prices of other commodities. **********On Monday, about 1,000 people trying to escape from Christian East Beirut came under shellfire at the port of Junieh as they waited to board a ferry bound for Cyprus, 150 miles away. Junieh is the Christians' only link with the outside world. **********Beirut airport, in the southern suburbs, has been closed since the beginning of the clashes. An overland route to Damascus across the Druse-controlled Shuf Mountains is being constantly shelled by the Christians. **********Today, Christian members of Parliament appealed for a cease-fire and an end to what they called ''the barbaric bombardment of innocent people.'' **********The relative calm enabled the 23 legislators to meet at the headquarters north of here of Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfair, spiritual leader of Lebanon's Maronite Catholics. **********The Christian legislators said that all forces on Lebanese soil must observe an immediate cease-fire, and that the Lebanese Army would supervise it in areas under their control while Syrian troops enforce it in places they are deployed. Syrian troops have been stationed in Lebanon since 1976 and have been in Beirut continuously since 1986. Rival Cabinets **********The Christian legislators' stand is regarded as moderate compared to that of Gen. Michel Aoun, the commander of Christian military forces and leader of a Christian cabinet that is the rival for power to Mr. Hoss's. **********The new spate of fighting started last month when General Aoun imposed an air and sea blockade against Muslim-controlled Lebanese seaports. Syrian troops and their Lebanese muslim allies retaliated by cutting off almost all links with the Christian areas, and shelled the Christian-controlled harbors of Beirut and Junieh. **********As the violence worsened, General Aoun said it was not a question of ports, but of the Syrian military presence. He proclaimed a ''war of liberation'' to drive the 40,000 Syrian soldiers out of Lebanese territory. **********Today, in an interview with a Christian radio station, General Aoun declared that Lebanon would be ''a graveyard for the Syrian,'' and that he would not stop until ''Assad's head is smashed,'' referring to the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/10/business/price-soars-for-black-pearls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Price Soars For Black Pearls", "print_headline": "Price Soars For Black Pearls", "body_text": " **********Heavy Japanese buying sent the price of black pearls soaring at weekend auctions in Tahiti, dealers said today. **********Growers who brought nearly 39,000 black pearls from their oyster beds in the lagoons of French Polynesia received about 40 percent more than expected for their annual harvest. **********The pearls, weighing a total of almost 17 pounds, sold for a total of $4.8 million, compared with the expected total of $3.4 million. **********The single sale, closely followed by the industry, usually accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of the entire output of French Polynesia. **********Japanese buyers snapped up 60 percent of the darkly gleaming pearls, the annual output of the Poe Rava Nui group, which markets the cultured crop for 150 producers spread over 18 tropical atolls. **********The island chain, which has increased its black pearl production eightfold over the past eight years, exported nearly 95 pounds of pearls last year for about $23 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/28/world/clamor-in-the-east-unshackled-czech-workers-declare-their-independence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clamor in the East; Unshackled Czech Workers Declare Their Independence", "print_headline": "Clamor in the East; Unshackled Czech Workers Declare Their Independence", "body_text": " **********Soon after the strike began today, Zdenek Janicek, a brewery worker in grimy overalls, rose on a platform and began to speak. **********''We hold these truths to be self-evident,'' he said, ''that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' **********For the nearly 1,500 workers who gathered to listen to him, today was a day of declaring independence from the stifling Communist leadership that has ruled Czechoslovakia for 40 years. Like millions throughout the nation, workers here walked off their jobs at noon in a two-hour general strike demanding greater democracy and an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. **********''Americans understood these rights more than 200 years ago,'' Mr. Janicek said after reciting part of the Declaration of Independence to his co-workers. ''We are only now learning to believe that we are entitled to the same rights.'' **********In Branik, the sooty industrial neighborhood where he spoke, workers in construction, carpentry, brewing, mining and other fields had scheduled a rally on the grounds of the V.D.U.P. Construction Company during the strike. The rally was held so that people in this area on the outskirts of Prague could witness the labor stoppage and know that workers here support the opposition movement. **********''It is not only intellectuals and dissidents and students who want change in this country,'' said Jan Malima, a building insulator, standing under the subfreezing, sunless sky, amid bold red, white and blue Czechoslovak flags snapping in the wind. ''Workers have been suffering under the yoke of Communism, too. Only we never before stood up and used our power to try to force change on our Government. But the students turned our attention in a way that forced us to look around and say loudly, 'We are with you.' '' **********A few minutes before noon today, Mr. Malima was unrolling wall insulation and laying it in place in an apartment building he was repairing on the edge of the city for the O.P.B.H. Construction Company. Nearby, Vitezslav Fabian was installing a lock in the apartment door, and on another floor a team of bricklayers were shoring up a wall that had begun to sag. **********As 12 o'clock struck, Mr. Malima looked at his watch, gave out a holler to his co-workers, and at once all of them set their tools on the ground, grabbed their coats and, still dusty from their heavy work, left the building to begin the strike and join the rally at V.D.U.P.. Consolidation of Forces **********The widespread two-hour general strike today was more than just a blow at the status quo. It was the culmination of a consolidation of forces among the country's defiant students and newly emboldened working class. **********Czechoslovak society has been stratified by social class and by 40 years of Communism, so intellectuals and workers had rarely entered each other's world. But during the 10 days of protests that have shaken this country, social barriers have given way to a unified attempt to break the longtime Communist hold on life here. **********Though the relationship between the students and the workers was tentative at first, with each apprehensive about the other's motives and prejudices, by today workers and students were embracing and applauding one another's efforts. **********At the rally at V.D.U.P., workers stood on a makeshift platform together with students from Charles University's philosophy and law departments. 'We Just Suffered' **********''For decades, my generation has been waiting and wondering when we would have a chance to be free human beings,'' said Antonin Sykora, a bricklayer. ''We didn't want the politicians to stay in their places, but we didn't think any force could move them out, so we just suffered. **********''And then the students came and gave us an example of which direction to follow and how to organize,'' he said. ''They spoke clearly about their demands and they appealed for our support, and now I say to you, we will stand behind them to this strike and any others that may be necessary.'' **********The audience of fellow workers cheered and called on the students to speak. **********Jan Kasal, a philosophy student at Charles University, told the workers that although the Government had responded to some demands by the students and the opposition group Civic Forum, there was much that had still not been fulfilled. **********''Some Government leaders may have been replaced, but many others still remain,'' Mr. Kasal said. ''Some political prisoners have been released, but many others remain in prison. This strike is to say to the leadership that those measures are not enough for us.'' **********The crowd responded enthusiastically. ''We are with you!'' the workers shouted in unison. ''We are with you!'' Seminar on Totalitarianism **********The two-hour strike was not simply a work stoppage in this neighborhood; in some ways it was like a seminar on the evils of totalitarianism, the path of civil disobedience and the merits of democracy. **********One worker from the V.D.U.P. company stood up on the platform and read from the ''Gulag Archipelago,'' Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's devastating account of life in the Stalinist labor camp, a work that has only recently been permitted in the Soviet Union, but is still banned here. **********An actor from the Realistic Theater, who came to show his support for the workers' action, recited some of the concepts espoused by Mohandas K. Gandhi, the leader of India's independence movement, and there was the soft reading from the Declaration of Independence that seemed to touch the workers deeply. **********When the speeches were done, the workers raised their heads to the flag and together sang their national anthem, a haunting melody sadly called ''Where Is My Homeland?'' March Through the Streets **********And the workers marched through the streets of their neighborhood, carrying large Czechoslovak flags and posters calling for free elections and freedom. **********They walked past restaurants, pharmacies, pastry shops and hardware stores, all bolted shut in sympathy with the strike. **********From their windows, neighborhood residents shouted their support for the workers. **********''Retirees greet you with pride!'' screamed one elderly man, waving to the marchers. **********And a young mother, holding her baby, called out, ''We love you!'' **********The march came to a stop before a military institute in the neighborhood.

In addition, Government officials said, announcement of an acceptance of a settlement with William Herbert Hunt is expected later this week. **********The settlements with the regulatory body are part of the reorganization plans filed by the brothers in Dallas. They filed for protection from their creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in September 1988 as a result of costs incurred in fighting lawsuits stemming from their forays into silver. **********The $10 million will be in addition to a multimillion-dollar settlement reached by Nelson Bunker Hunt to pay back taxes, fines and interest to the Internal Revenue Service. The I.R.S. will be paid 80 percent of the liquidation value of Mr. Hunt's personal estate. In bankruptcy proceedings, those assets, which include oil and real estate interests, were valued at about $150 million. **********A similar plan has been structured for William Herbert Hunt. **********While the full sale value of these assets, which have been placed in a trust and will be sold over the next six years, cannot be determined, Government officials said they hoped the Government would get more than $150 million in revenue from the combined fines and back taxes to be paid by the brothers. **********Many details of the Hunts' settlements were disclosed in their reorganization plans, which were filed last week. A Federal bankruptcy judge on Friday approved Nelson Bunker Hunt's reorganization plan. William Herbert Hunt's reorganization plan is expected to be approved later this week. **********The men were charged by the commodity commission in February 1985 with manipulating and attempting to manipulate the prices of silver futures contracts and silver bullion during 1979 and 1980. Silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to a peak of about $50 an ounce in January 1980. The price of silver then collapsed, falling below $11 an ounce in about two months. **********In his settlement with the C.F.T.C., Nelson Bunker Hunt, without admitting or denying guilt, consented to findings that he had illegally manipulated silver prices. Agreements on Thursday **********While the C.F.T.C. announced the settlement with Nelson Bunker Hunt yesterday and has yet to announce the settlement with William Herbert Hunt, the agreements were reached last Thursday in an effort to resolve their bankruptcy cases, Michael F. Wurst, a lawyer for Nelson Bunker Hunt, said yesterday. **********The settlements with the C.F.T.C. have been approved by the bankruptcy judge in the case, Harold C. Abramson. Nelson Bunker Hunt's settlement was approved the same day the judge accepted his reorganization plan. **********The action filed by the C.F.T.C. had been delayed pending the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings. But a commission official said yesterday that if a settlement had not been reached, the commission had intended to pursue the action after the brothers' reorganization plans were approved. **********The C.F.T.C had originally sought a good deal more from the two brothers but agreed to the settlement partly because it cleared the way for the reorganization plan. **********Under the agreement with the C.F.T.C., it will be allowed a claim of $1.5 million in Nelson Bunker Hunt's bankruptcy proceeding. Payment From Inheritances **********While the reorganization plan does not provide the full amount of money that Nelson Bunker Hunt will owe to the C.F.T.C., he will be required to continue to pay the agency from inheritances received by him. **********However, those payments will not be made until he has paid his debts to the I.R.S. The proposal accepted by William Herbert Hunt was structured in a similar way, Government officials said. **********In its complaint against the brothers, the C.F.T.C. charged that they and others had manipulated the silver market by purchasing futures contracts at the same time they were acquiring millions of ounces of silver. A futures contract calls for delivery of a commodity at the time of the contract's expiration. **********The value of the contracts can be expected to rise as the supply of the commodity tightens."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/world/exiled-king-s-body-returned.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exiled King's Body Returned", "print_headline": "Exiled King's Body Returned", "body_text": " **********Thousands of people turned out in Yugoslavia's southern republic of Montenegro today for the return of the remains of their last king, who died in exile in Italy in 1921.

But now those locomotives are wearing out, and railroads' freight business is booming. So orders for new machines are pouring in. **********As recently as 1987, G.E. and the other American manufacturer, the Electro-Motive division of the General Motors Corporation, delivered a total of only 131 locomotives worldwide. But last year the two companies turned out 531 locomotives, of which about half were sold in the United States and half abroad. **********Industry analysts think production could reach 700 this year. A locomotive costs as much as $1.5 million and can develop 4,000 horsepower. **********''With deregulation, the railroads were able to operate much more efficiently,'' said Frank N. Wilner, an official of the Association of American Railroads. ''The result was surplus equipment. Now that equipment is finally wearing out and new orders are being placed.'' The surplus was so great at one point that 6,000 locomotives were sitting idle. **********The latest locomotives are more sophisticated than their predecessors, with computerized controls and operators who can trouble-shoot problems with onboard television screens that display what diagnostic circuits are reporting. Tests are expected to begin next year with a prototype engine that will burn a slurry of finely pulverized coal instead of diesel fuel. And engineers are also studying how to build locomotives that would use alternating electric current to drive the wheels instead of the traditional direct current. **********''Locomotives still look the same, but there's a whole world of new technology we are applying,'' said Martin J. Hapeman, head of engineering at G.E.'s Erie plant. He said design and manufacturing techniques from the aerospace industry were increasingly being adapted in locomotives. **********The Erie plant itself represents new manufacturing technology in which subassemblies are manufactured separately and brought together for final assembly. Gone is the old method of building up a locomotive piece by piece. **********The rebound in demand appears to justify the heavy investments both companies made in new products and production processes in the early 1980's - investments that looked questionable as sales dragged. The sales rebound also appears to insure a future for both manufacturers, which had difficulty justifying their existence to corporate parents during the prolonged slump. **********Neither company reports the earnings of its divisions, but the surge in orders has clearly improved profitability. The former manager of the G.E. division said it was ''marginally profitable'' at sales levels that prevailed in 1987. Michael D. Lockhard, the manager now, called the current situation ''marvelously profitable.'' **********In addition, the railroad industry, after a period of reorganization and consolidation, is financially healthier than it has been in years. The number of revenue-ton miles of cargo hauled, a key economic measure, reached a record 997 billion last year and is expected to top one trillion this year. **********Total profits for the seven railroad systems that dominate the nation are expected to reach $2.2 billion for 1988. That would provide a return on investment of about 8 percent, the best in modern railroading history. **********Despite this robust picture, though, few expect sales to approach those of the 1960's and 1970's, when they routinely topped 1,000 a year. G.E. said it is limited by engine availability to 330 units this year and next, while G.M., which said it has the capacity to produce up to 800, does not expect anywhere near that many orders. **********One reason for lower sales is a trend toward more powerful machines. Power levels have grown steadily from about 2,100 horsepower in the early 1960's to the current 4,000 horsepower, making it possible for three locomotives to pull a train that once required four. And even mightier engines are in sight. **********A positive effect of using fewer locomotives per train, and the resulting gains in operating efficiency, is greater fuel economy. Railroads managed 307 revenue-ton miles per gallon of fuel in 1987, compared with 290 in 1986. But savings have a price. Locomotives now cost $1.3 million to $1.5 million each, compared with under $1 million a decade ago. **********Forecasting demand is one of the knottiest problems in the business. ''When times are good, railroads want capital goods and they want them right away,'' said John Jarrell, manager of Electro-Motive. ''But if you go from 200 locomotives to 800 and back again it becomes a disaster in terms of reducing the work force, rehiring and training.'' **********The heart of a modern locomotive, which is about 70 feet long and weighs almost 200 tons, is the turbocharged engine, which has a displacement about 70 times that of a typical automobile engine. **********The engine drives an alternator that produces electrical power, which is transmitted to motors driving each set of wheels. Converting the engine's enormous mechanical power to electricity allows for infinitely variable power transmission to the wheel-mounted motors. **********When G.E. modernized its pre-1920 red brick factory complex here in the early 1980's, it installed a modular assembly process for locomotives. Instead of building the machine in one place by adding a piece at a time, large sections are now built and tested in other plants and then brought to the final line so that only a few components need to be assembled at the end. **********At the same time, the number of job classifications was cut from five to two, and workers now operate in teams, rather than individually. The changes in assembly procedure and the increased flexibility of the team approach reduced from four weeks to three the time needed to put a locomotive together, said Paul W. Jones, head of manufacturing. **********Engineers who design locomotives bristle at any notion that they are mired in a low-technology industry. Microprocessors control the operations of the latest generation of locomotives, they note, including on-board diagnostic circuits with display screens that tell operators where the problems are. **********The tractor motors that drive the engine perform a double function as they are reversed during braking to act as generators. Instead of its usual task of converting electrical energy to mechanical movement, the reversed motors absorb mechanical energy in slowing the train and convert it to electricity. **********This power is fed into a resistance grid, which is like a giant toaster element, at the top of the locomotive, where it is converted to heat and dispersed to the outside. Using the motors this way helps reduce the wear and tear on brake shoes throughout the train.  Assembling a Locomotive  At General Electric's locomotive plant in Erie, Pa., locomotives are built in separate modules and then brought together for final assembly, a process that is faster than building them at one location. Assembly begins with a steel platform  (1). The diesel engine, the radiator and the wheels, known as trucks, are attached to the platform. The operator and engine cabs are dropped into place  (2). The completed locomotive is painted, tested and prepared for shipment  (3). The entire process takes only three weeks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/world/nicaragua-to-deport-american-suspected-of-drug-trafficking.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1989-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 341, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nicaragua to Deport American Suspected Of Drug Trafficking", "print_headline": "Nicaragua to Deport American Suspected Of Drug Trafficking", "body_text": " **********Nicaraguan officials said today that they will deport to the United States an American pilot who crash-landed his private plane in Nicaragua last month in what authorities described as a drug-related flight. **********The Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, Miguel d'Escoto Brockman, said in an interview that the 39-year-old pilot, Arthur Henry Burton Jr., would be handed over in the next few days to officials at the American Embassy.

Peron came vibrantly alive in Argentina today as Carlos Saul Menem, the Peronist presidential candidate, ended his campaign to outpourings of adoration and expectation. **********Mr. Menem, generally acknowledged to be the front-runner in the election on Sunday, spoke at midnight Wednesday to an estimated 250,000 people stretched out for 30 blocks in the working-class suburb of La Matanza. He then rode atop his Menemobile, a luxury bus with a roof platform, through crowds in the heart of Buenos Aires to the Congress today. **********Eduardo Angeloz, the candidate of the Radical Civic Union of President Raul Alfonsin, is waging an uphill battle because of public dissatisfaction with the Alfonsin Government. He closed his campaign with rallies this week in Radical strongholds: the federal district of Buenos Aires, the town of Rosario and the capital of the province that he governs, Cordoba. **********While Mr. Angeloz drew more than 100,000 people at each rally, Radical supporters, mostly from the middle and upper-middle classes, are not known for displaying the fervor of the poor and working-class people who have formed the basis of the Peronist movement since General Peron first came to power as a military dictator in 1946. Peron's Face Is Backdrop **********Mr. Menem, a slightly built man of 58 with trademark cheek whiskers, wore jeans and a powder-blue leather jacket as he spoke in La Matanza before a backdrop with the face of Peron. The candidate, who is Governor of the province of La Rioja, attacked his rival for having professional campaign advisers from the United States and promised a government that would see to ''national unity,'' begin a ''productive revolution,'' and help bring about the ''integration'' of Latin America. **********Then he boarded the top of the Menemobile and waved victory signs to the crowd that surrounded the vehicle, forcing it to inch its way along the street.

Although all polls give him the lead over Mr. Angeloz, few have predicted a clear majority for him. The presence of several other candidates, some only in certain provinces, adds to the difficulty in obtaining a majority. **********Like the United States, Argentina has an electoral college system, with the difference that here electors from each province are allotted on the basis of the percentage of the vote each candidate receives, instead of the winner taking all of the electors. If no candidate emerges from Sunday's voting with a majority of the 600 electors, then those backing the candidates of smaller parties will play a decisive role. Candidates' Platforms **********If the electoral college is unable to reach agreement by Aug. 10, the constitutional deadline, the election of the next President passes to Congress, where the debate could stretch out until the scheduled inauguration of the new leader on Dec. 10. **********The 57-year-old Mr. Angeloz promises to denationalize the large state enterprises that are responsible for vast fiscal deficits, to be aggressive in seeking foreign investment, to retain the recently freed foreign exchange market, to break the power of the Peronist-controlled labor movement and to push Argentina toward a more export-oriented economy. **********Mr. Menem, whose party has traditionally stood for economic nationalism, statism and trade barriers and has often shown a tolerant attitude toward high inflation, has said repeatedly that he wants to change that history, but has not been clear about how far he would go toward the basically free-market economic program that Mr. Angeloz advocates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/business/key-rates-402889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/13/business/bear-stearns-will-resume-index-arbitrage-for-itself.html": {"writer_name": "Sarah Bartlett", "pub_date": "1989-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 731, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bear, Stearns Will Resume Index Arbitrage for Itself", "print_headline": "Bear, Stearns Will Resume Index Arbitrage for Itself", "body_text": " **********Bear, Stearns & Company yesterday became the first major Wall Street firm to resume index arbitrage for its own account. **********The step was taken after lengthy consultations with the New York Stock Exchange, industry officials and important customers, the firm said, and will be put into effect only in conjunction with self-imposed contraints intended to reduce market volatility. **********Considered the most controversial form of program trading, index arbitrage involves profiting from momentary discrepancies between the price of a basket of stocks and that of the futures contract based on that basket. The New York Stock Exchange defines program trading as the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 stocks. Blamed for Oct. 13 Slide **********Like many others, the firm agreed in late October to abandon index arbitrage for its own account after the practice was blamed for roiling the stock market, and, in particular, for contributing to the 190-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13. **********In mid-November, Bear, Stearns's chairman, Alan C. Greenberg, explained that his firm halted its index arbitrage trading not out of sympathy with the strategy's critics but out of sympathy with its clients. ''We try to abide by the customers' wishes,'' he said, ''even if we believe their ire is aimed at the wrong party.'' **********In explaining yesterday's decision, the firm pointed to a lack of progress by legislators or regulators in introducing corrective measures to reduce volatility. In particular, the firm said it seemed unlikely that margin requirements on financial futures would be raised, a step the firm has publicly endorsed. **********Spokesmen for other large Wall Street firms that have halted index arbitrage for their own accounts, like Morgan Stanley and Kidder, Peabody, said they were surprised by Bear, Stearns's decision but did not expect to follow suit. Several said this was not the first time Mr. Greenberg, an avid trader and outspoken advocate of free markets, had taken the first step on this issue. Bear, Stearns was one of the first firms to resume proprietary index arbitrage in 1988, after it had halted the practice for several months in the wake of the 1987 crash. 'I Wish They Wouldn't Do It' **********Its action yesterday has already earned it at least one critic. Lawrence M. Zicklin, a managing partner at Neuberger & Berman, said: ''I wish they wouldn't do it. It causes intra-day volatility.'' Neuberger & Berman spoke out strongly against program trading after the Dow plunged on Oct. 13, arguing that it was turning the stock market into nothing more than a ''numbers racket.'' **********To help insure that its renewed activity does not disrupt the market, Bear, Stearns said it would refrain from proprietary index arbitrage if the Dow falls by 50 points. It also said that it would continue to observe the industry's ''circuit-breakers,'' which impose market pauses in volatile periods, and that it would sell stocks only when they are trading on an uptick. **********Despite those voluntary constraints, yesterday's action pits Bear, Stearns against the New York Stock Exchange, which on Nov. 2 requested that its member firms voluntarily refrain from executing program trades for their own accounts. 'Stabilizing and Responsible' **********Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the exchange, said yesterday that ''the request stands.'' But he said Bear, Stearns seemed to be resuming its index arbitrage activity in a ''stabilizing and responsible way.'' **********In September, the last month before program trading came under fire, Bear, Stearns was the fourth-most-active Big Board member firm to conduct index arbitrage. Of the 28.2 million shares it executed that month in all forms of program trading, 20 million were related to index arbitrage strategies. Bear, Stearns was also heavily biased toward trading for its own account. Of the total, 24.1 million shares were traded for its own account, as opposed to being traded for customers. **********In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Greenberg denied that the firm's own business prospects were an issue in the recent decision. ''We lost money in proprietary index arbitrage in the first four months of the year,'' he said, referring to the firm's fiscal year, which begins in July. The decision to resume proprietary index arbitrage, he said, was ''an issue of principle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/business/perestroikas-yankee-partner.html": {"writer_name": "A.

Suddenly a forest of refinery towers emerges in the distance. The air turns sulfurous. Then, Nizhnekamsk - a city of 191,000 people with tall, drab apartment buildings, billboards extolling the Communist worker, mounds of melting brown snow. **********High above the city, in a Spartan apartment, sits Vatslav Krotov, a 54-year-old engineer, sipping tea and smoking a harsh Bulgarian cigarette. He is the president of Applied Engineered Systems, the first Soviet-American joint venture to be established under perestroika. The partners in the enterprise are the Ministry of Oil Refining and Petrochemical Industries and Combustion Engineering, of Stamford, Conn. **********''What we are doing is controversial and dangerous,'' Krotov says. ''There are people in the Soviet Union who want joint ventures to fail.'' He crushes his cigarette in an ashtray and walks slowly toward a window. Darkness has fallen, but the night is lit with the roaring flares of the refinery stacks. He points toward an old concrete schoolhouse, now the headquarters of A.E.S. ''The critics ask what we need all these new ideas for. I tell them we need new ideas to survive.'' **********According to Soviet bankers, one out of every eight Russian industrial enterprises is on the brink of collapse; an equal number operate at a loss. The Russians have the raw materials in abundance. What they lack are modern manufacturing technology and management know-how -and the hard currency to buy them from the West. The ruble is not freely exchangeable for Western currencies. In January 1987, in a bold move to fill that vacuum, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, changed the law to permit joint ventures with foreign companies. **********Previous trade collaborations with the Soviet Union had been limited to the direct sale of goods or services, paid from the nation's scant supply of hard currency, or by means of complex barter arrangements. **********Pepsico, for example, does about $400 million in trade annually with the Soviet food ministry, providing cola concentrate in return for the right to buy and distribute Stolichnaya vodka in the United States; Pepsico has passed on that privilege to Monsieur Henri Wines in return for cash. **********Joint ventures, however, demand that each partner assume a financial stake in the new enterprise, assuring the Soviets of a fresh supply of hard currency. **********The chance to do a joint venture in the Soviet Union sent hundreds of American corporate executives and entrepreneurs flocking to Moscow. **********Soviet chic. Catfish farmers and swimming-pool tarpaulin manufacturers were joined by the likes of Donald Trump, the real estate developer, who discussed building luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. **********''American business talks up joint ventures as the greatest thing since Cheez Whiz,'' says a senior American diplomat in Moscow, who estimates that American companies spent $50 million last year trying to get a deal going. **********Some 40 agreements with American companies or their foreign subsidiaries have been initiated. But only a handful of these new companies are actually on-line and, almost without exception, they are losing money. The chief exception: A.E.S. Since its start-up in the spring of 1988, the venture has received orders totaling more than $50 million and predicts a profit of more than $1 million for 1989 on sales of $30 million. **********The company has a critical advantage over most other joint ventures. Its product - process-control equipment - is essential to the modernizing of large segments of Soviet industry. But the success in the schoolhouse in Nizhnekamsk is also the story of bureaucratic pitfalls surmounted, of cultural differences resolved and of an American company that learned how to practice the first law of doing business in the Soviet Union: Cross your fingers and improvise. **********CHARLES E. HUGEL, THE 60-year-old C.E.O. of Combustion Engineering, sits in a threadbare chair in a Moscow hotel room, sucking on a cola, his bare feet propped up on a bed. ''Our people don't have big egos,'' he says. ''We laugh at the problems we face here. Last summer, the hotel bathroom smelled like Penn Station, so I got a bucket, stole some detergent from the maid and scrubbed the floor. Most American businessmen smell the bathrooms and say, 'The hell with it. I'm going home.' '' **********Hugel joined Combustion in 1982 after a 30-year career with A.T.&T.; The timing was not auspicious. Originally a manufacturer of boilers for electric utilities, the company had branched out into making petroleum equipment. When the oil and power industries plummeted, Combustion was in deep trouble. Hugel turned the company inside out, cutting the work force by a third, selling off oil-patch product lines, buying up high-tech companies in the process-control and automation areas. Within five years, Combustion was solidly in the black, though expenses connected with the development of new technologies left the company with a loss last year of $245 million on sales of $3.5 billion. **********On July 4, 1985, Hugel flew to Moscow to sign a $12 million contract to upgrade the process-control system at an ethylene plant in Nizhnekamsk. Combustion had a long and profitable history of selling its products and services to the Soviet Union. When Hugel arrived, he found that Moscow was rife with rumors that the Russians were going to permit joint ventures. And the outspoken C.E.O. took the occasion to suggest such a partnership to an official in the trade ministry. **********Over the following months, Hugel discussed the idea with Nikolai Lemayev, whom Gorbachev had just named minister of oil refining. The Russians were enthusiastic. ''Some of our attorneys actually helped the Soviets draw up their joint venture law,'' Hugel says. After the law took effect, in 1987, the bargaining began in earnest. **********Under the final agreement, A.E.S. would provide customers with a package that included process-control units called MOD 30's and related computer software. The systems would be assembled in Nizhnekamsk from parts supplied by Combustion. Each partner would kick in $8 million, with Combustion contributing $1 million in cash and the remainder in management services. The Soviet partner would own 51 percent of the venture, as the law demanded. (It has since been changed to permit majority Western ownership.) The MOD 30's would be sold in the Soviet Union, with the partners sharing the profits - if any. **********Every Western partner in a Soviet joint venture confronts one major question: Since rubles are nonconvertible, how will profits be taken? At first, A.E.S. agreed to be paid in petroleum products, which it could then sell on the world market for hard currency. But eventually most of the customers, including the oil refining ministry, were willing to pay in hard currency. The ministry is one of the few Soviet departments with a substantial store of hard currency. **********Another potential stumbling block was removed when the United States Commerce Department approved an export license for the project. Washington exercises special care with high-tech products that might have military applications. **********NIZHNEKAMSK WAS JUST A WOODLAND VILLAGE on the Kama River until the bulldozers arrived almost three decades ago. Today, it is a 13-square-mile metal jungle of towers and storage tanks and pipes, churning out synthetic rubber and a host of petrochemicals. **********In the control room of the ethylene plant, men in hard hats move about the big room, their rubber coats stacked in piles in the corners. This is the nerve center of the plant. **********Within fiery refinery towers, electronic sensors monitor heat and pressure, sending a constant flow of information to the control room. The data show up on dozens of dials and graphs set into a long wall and are fed into a computer, which then sends operating instructions back to the towers. The men in hard hats study the wall of dials, where red lights blink on and off. At the first sign of trouble, they can override the computer instructions. **********THIS SYSTEM IS THE FRUIT OF THE $12 million contract Hugel signed in 1985. The installation of Western-made MOD 30's (A.E.S. engineers call them winky blinkies) has made it possible for the plant to produce $5 million to $10 million worth of ethylene above and beyond its quota. That kind of achievement has taken on special gloss in the light of Gorbachev's emphasis on economic accountability. **********Cost effectiveness has never been a priority in a nation whose factory managers have operated according to quotas set by politicians, where quantity has substituted for quality. Now, 60 percent of Russian industry is expected to become financially self-sufficient, a heroic goal. But winky blinkies can help - not only in petrochemicals but across a wide range of industries, from steel to textiles to pharmaceuticals. **********According to Andy Pechkovsky, the Moscow-based vice president of A.E.S. whose responsibilities include marketing, the hunger for MOD 30's is insatiable. ''We walk into a plant,'' says Pechkovsky, ''and they tear us apart for these things. We sold $15 million worth of MOD's to the Moscow refinery, and they celebrated over signing the contract for days.'' **********WHEN DAVID LEWIS ARRIVED IN Nizhnekamsk in the spring of 1988 with his wife and two children, fresh from a Combustion assignment in South Korea, he didn't know what to expect. As the co-manager of the A.E.S. plant, he would be one of only 25 Western businessmen based in the city, and the only representative of an American company. ''I was filled with a mild dread,'' the husky, 33-year-old Englishman recalls. ''My only prior run-in with the Russians was the horrid time I had changing planes in Moscow a few years ago.'' **********His forebodings about his co-workers soon vanished. ''Their skills and enthusiasm surprised me very quickly,'' he says. Which is not to say the job has been easy. **********The site chosen for the plant was a two-story annex to an old, concrete technical school. The terms of the rental agreement, as of every stage of the project, were subject to intense negotiation between the partners. **********When a joint venture sets about buying or renting space or equipment in the Soviet Union, the Russian partner generally quotes a price based on the official exchange rate of about $1.65 to the ruble, though the going rate in the country may be less than half that amount. Nabih Baaklini, a Combustion executive who has made more than 30 trips to the Soviet Union in the past three years, describes the company's bargaining strategy: **********''Say the Soviets come up with a building that's priced at a million rubles, but we don't feel it's worth $1.65 million. First we evaluate the property in dollars, mentally converting that to rubles at the official rate. Then we negotiate the ruble price, not the exchange rate, down to what we decided the property was worth.'' **********Transforming the schoolhouse annex into a factory was the first challenge Lewis and his Russian counterpart, Genady Grechuha, faced. A glass-walled enclosure was created in which customers could learn to operate the MOD 30 system; each package is tailor-made for its particular application. Unlike so many other American business outposts in the Soviet Union, Lewis's office boasts no fancy imported furnishings. That cut costs, and it sent a signal to the Soviet side that Combustion was more concerned with productivity than posturing. ''Little things like that can make a big difference,'' Lewis says. **********The core of the A.E.S. operation is the MOD 30 assembly hall, where wires and valves compete for workbench space with thick technical manuals and tea mugs. Valodya Tashkinof, a young Tatar engineer, points to the completed winky blinky on his bench and announces, ''I did it with my hands.'' He is much respected by his colleagues as being the first Soviet citizen to assemble a MOD 30. **********Yuri Federiv, the 37-year-old head of project engineering, sits beside a window that bathes the hall in sunlight, examining another MOD 30. ''What I do is insert the brains of the system,'' he says. ''The toughest time of my life,'' he recalls, scratching his cheek with his glasses, ''was the three-month trial period before becoming part of the management team. I'm at the age of Pushkin, so maybe now things will be easier.'' **********The latest addition to the schoolhouse is an environmental test chamber where components of the winky blinkies are subjected to extreme heat and pressure. The space was once occupied by lockers and showers. ''I've acquired a new concern for safety,'' says the Soviet manager, Grechuha. ''There's absolutely no margin for error in a winky blinky. A customer could go up in flames if we fail to do our job.'' **********The Russian managers and workers at A.E.S. - a total of 40 - are an elite group, handpicked by Krotov, the president. Grechuha, for example, had been a manager of Nizhnekamsk's synthetic rubber production. But to get his people, Krotov had to fight. ''I had many hours of arguments with the party apparatus in Moscow,'' he says. ''The petrochemical bosses are still offended that I took their best workers away.'' **********Private business of any kind, much less partnership with a foreign corporation, is a radical departure from what Lenin had in mind when he unleashed Bolshevik cannon on Moscow's banks and mercantile houses in 1917. In spite of Gorbachev, Soviet ministries and foreign trade organizations have no taste for ventures that fly in the face of Communist ideology and lessen the bureaucrats' control. **********Finding workers who were willing to risk joining A.E.S. was difficult. ''Many times they received threats against their lives,'' Krotov says. ''People don't budge without instructions from the top, without the right political protection.'' **********Once the A.E.S. work force was assembled, Lewis faced a formidable task. The employees had to be introduced to the elaborate American process-control system. They had to absorb American engineering and marketing approaches that are very different from the Soviet models. And they had to unlearn many of their notions about how a factory runs. **********Soviet engineers are talented researchers, but they have had little experience in harnessing technology to produce marketable goods and services. Soviet plants turn out almost twice as much steel as their American counterparts, yet the nation suffers from a chronic steel shortage, in part because its manufactured goods use too much steel: Soviet cars can weigh twice as much as American cars. **********The workers at A.E.S., Lewis says, have ''excellent technical skills.'' But they had to be instructed in the complexities of the MOD 30 system. Combustion engineers were brought in to help, and the response was enthusiastic. ''They pore over the information we give them like poetry,'' says Fred Eurieck, Combustion's market-development manager for process-control systems. ''I've even seen Krotov down on the floor pulling out circuit boards during some of the classes.'' Several of the A.E.S. executives and workers have also spent time in the United States, studying operations at Combustion plants and taking part in management development programs. **********The constant flow of experts and expert advice from Combustion is duly appreciated by the members of the A.E.S. team, but they express occasional feelings of being smothered. Like any big corporation with a large family of subsidiaries, a Combustion executive allows, the American company sees A.E.S. as one of its children - to the point that A.E.S. must grasp for its own identity. **********KROTOV AND THE COMBUSTION managers wanted relationships between workers and supervisors to reflect modern Western models, but they met with resistance. Russian industry, mired in bureaucracy, has wandered far from the old-time Communist principles of equality and teamwork. ''We Americans tend to be more rebellious toward structure when we don't agree with it,'' Eurieck says. ''There is still some fear here when a worker confronts his boss about the real problems he faces.'' Yuri Federev admits, ''At first I didn't support Krotov's ideas of teamwork. Then, at every turn, I saw that he was right.'' **********Inevitably, the most delicate relationship is that between Lewis and Grechuha, a tall, somber 41-year-old engineer - the two men with such disparate backgrounds who share the job of running the factory. They report directly to Krotov and Pechkovsky in Moscow. **********From all appearances, the managers have developed a cheerful friendship. ''We argue at times,'' says Lewis, ''but we keep it to ourselves and give the workers a united front.'' They argued, for example, over which room in the schoolhouse would be used for a particular operation. Who won? Lewis refuses to say. Getting the job done is what counts. **********In the course of coming to terms with their differences and improvising new solutions to problems, the men from Combustion and their Russian counterparts have forged their own version of glasnost. For Gerry Vesling, a 62-year-old Combustion product manager, the moment of truth arrives on a winter day in a wooden hut set in the middle of a snowfield. **********It is Vesling's first visit to Nizhnekamsk, and his introduction to a banya. He is lying on a bench, naked except for the leather aviator helmet that protects his head from the blasts of steam. His similarly attired companions include Krotov, Pechkovsky, Lewis and Alex Vorozheikin, a chief engineer at the Nizhnekamsk complex. Vorozheikin is whipping Vesling with birch twigs. Vesling asks if this is part of the joint venture protocol. Pechkovsky replies, ''It's part of the improvisation.'' **********Later, sipping a cold beer in an anteroom, Vesling casts a critical eye at the banya's wood-burning stove. ''You know,'' he says, ''we could install a MOD system in here and increase the heat efficiency.'' That leads to an animated discussion of how best to accomplish the task. At one point, Vesling inquires whether Charley Hugel has been through the banya routine. ''We're going to get him next time,'' says Krotov. **********A major problem faced by A.E.S., according to Lewis and Grechuha, is quality control. The joint venture has graduated from simply assembling systems from American-made parts to manufacturing some of the parts itself. Before A.E.S. actually puts together one of its custom-made packages, which can consist of hundreds of winky blinkies and related instrumentation and software, the company sends a prototype to Combustion for rigorous testing. In one case, for example, a thermostat built in the schoolhouse failed to pass muster, and the system was built using an American-made thermostat. **********Eventually, though, A.E.S. is planning to manufacture and assemble the entire MOD 30 system. At that point, the company will be in a position to sell components to Combustion and systems to customers in other parts of the world - assuming that a marketing arrangement can be worked out with Combustion. Both prospects would bring in what the joint venture's Soviet partner most earnestly desires: hard currency. **********As A.E.S. production increases, another problem looms ever larger -efficient transport. Flights in and out of the local airport, which has a single runway, are hostage to violent crosswinds that keep planes grounded for days. Moving equipment by truck or rail requires permission from other Soviet ministries and miles of red tape. That kind of delay, a major frustration for Western businessmen involved in joint ventures, is so standard that the Russians have invented a word for it: moodistika, or bureaucratic bull. **********A.E.S. management, always improvising, has entered negotiations with the Moscow Business Center, a cooperative dedicated to helping foreign business ventures. It is one of thousands of organizations that have sprung up in the wake of Gorbachev's call for private enterprise to compete with state monopolies. Eventually, the center, a specialist in cutting through red tape, may take over responsibility for A.E.S. transport. **********EACH MORNING, THE STREETS of Nizhnekamsk come alive just before 7 o'clock. Men in dark fur hats and women wearing colorful scarves fill the icy pavement in front of the apartment complex where the Western community is housed. In the canteen, Fred Eurieck, the market-development manager, is attacking a stack of blinis. **********''Look at this,'' Eurieck exclaims, waving a spoon at a pile of papers. ''I won't sign these.'' A.E.S. people had assured him that they would not build any systems until they had customer orders in hand - the way Americans do business - but the reports indicate plans to build without orders. **********One of those responsible for getting those orders is the 50-year-old vice president, Andy Pechkovsky, a Canadian of Russian parentage who radiates nervous energy. He and a staff of 20 operate out of a bare-bones office on the top floor of a decrepit hotel in Moscow. Their assignment: to target potential customers, make sales calls, discuss how MOD 30 systems might be installed, arrange deals. **********A.E.S. has received serious inquiries on over $400 million worth of product, but for many would-be customers, financing is the major roadblock. A.E.S. will take payment in rubles on a small order. Otherwise, A.E.S. bills customers about 25 percent in rubles, the cost of assembling the package in Nizhnekamsk, and 75 percent in hard currency, the cost of the components from the West. Financing is provided by means of hard-currency loans from the state foreign-trade bank. **********''You can't think of a joint venture as a way to make only dollars,'' says Pechkovsky. ''Our potential market here in rubles is bigger than in dollars.'' As more and more of the MOD 30's are manufactured as well as assembled at the schoolhouse, the proportion of materials paid for in rubles will rise, and that will make it possible for customers to pay the lion's share of the price in rubles. Meanwhile, the theory goes, A.E.S. will be selling its systems abroad, obtaining hard currency profits to split with Combustion. **********As part of the original joint venture deal, A.E.S. was granted a two-year tax deferral. When that runs out, the company's profits, minus a sum set aside for research and expansion, will be taxed at 30 percent. What remains will be divided between the American and Russian partners. Then, as now, Combustion will have to leave 20 percent of its share with the finance ministry in return for the right to move the hard currency out of the country. In filing its United States taxes, Combustion will be able to take the 30 percent levy as a tax credit. **********TODAY, A.E.S. IS LOOKING FORWARD to the day when another Combustion system, the MOD 300, will be assembled at the schoolhouse in Nizhnekamsk. This is a far more sophisticated system than the MOD 30, capable of controlling the operations of an entire plant. A typical MOD 300 installation might cost $1 million, compared to $100,000 for a typical MOD 30 installation. **********Meanwhile Combustion is moving ahead with another Soviet venture with the oil-refining ministry, joining a consortium that includes McDermott International and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Company to build two petrochemical complexes in Siberia. The project, still in the discussion stage, could cost as much as $20 billion. **********As Combustion and A.E.S. freely admit, joint ventures have their considerable risks - not least of which is the distinct possibility that the liberal policies introduced by Gorbachev will be revoked. That kind of turnabout has happened before. **********In the United States, many a Government official frowns upon Soviet-American partnerships, and many a corporation harbors unrealistic expectations. Says an American diplomat in Moscow: ''There's a big crack between the poor fool who is really here trying to create a joint venture and the board of directors back in the States who read all these pro-perestroika stories with dollar signs in their eyes.'' **********In the Soviet Union, powerful forces in the Government still oppose Gorbachev's economic opening to the West, and many ministries are unwilling to put their small cache of hard currency into ventures that may not pay off for years. **********The larger significance of A.E.S., says Vatslav Krotov, lies in its symbolic value: ''It will show the bureaucrats in both our countries that Soviets and Americans can work together successfully.'' **********There is another cloud on the A.E.S. horizon, a competitor. Honeywell and the Soviet fertilizer ministry have established a joint venture to install Honeywell process-control systems. But Krotov, for one, insists that he is not worried. **********''We are better,'' he proclaims. ''The heads are alike but the brains are different,'' he adds slyly, sticking a finger inside a MOD 30 to illustrate his sales pitch. The Combustion equipment is of more recent design. Finally, in a burst of free-enterprise enthusiasm, he delivers his clincher: ''They are welcome to open a factory next door, and we will beat them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/12/business/gm-raises-car-prices-3.4-for-1990.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1989-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 427, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

The Chrysler Corporation, which raised prices 2.3 percent last year, has not announced its 1990 policy.  Buyer Resistance Expected **********Analysts have suggested that the Big Three automobile companies will meet considerable resistance to the higher prices because the auto market is already in a downturn and consumers have generally refused to purchase passive restraints, like air bags and automatic seat belts, when these have been offered as options. **********Air bags inflate in a crash to cushion the heads of drivers, and in some cases front-seat passengers. Automatic seat belts wrap around occupants as the car doors are closed. One or the other is required in all 1990 models. Additional safety features, like shoulder harnesses in the back seats, will be introduced in future years. **********Terry Sullivan, a spokesman for G.M., said the projected increase was based on preliminary prices that the company would quote to dealers next week, along with specific prices for particular models. Final prices will be set shortly before the new models are introduced on Sept. 28. **********But final prices do not tell the whole story. In determining the average percentage price increase, manufacturers take into account any items that were formerly optional but are now installed as standard equipment. Further, the quoted prices do not necessarily reflect what customers end up paying. **********Rebates or subsidized financing arrangements, offered directly by the companies or channeled through their dealers, cut the final purchase price.

Gorbachev joined hands today with Pope John Paul II. **********Seven decades of spiritual and philosophical conflict came to a symbolic end as the two talked for more than an hour in the heart of Vatican City, the first encounter between a Soviet Communist leader and a Pope. **********Both men agreed in principle to establish diplomatic ties, and Mr. Gorbachev invited the Pope to make a return visit to the Soviet Union. Pope is Noncommital **********The Pope's reply to the invitation was noncommittal. It appeared that before saying yes, he intended to keep on pressing Moscow to restore religious liberties to Soviet Catholics. According to a spokesman, the Pope ''cordially thanked'' his guest, and said he hoped that ''developments would make it possible for him to accept.'' **********Much will apparently depend on what happens to the four million to five million Eastern Rite Catholics in the Ukraine, where the Polish-born Pope has a special interest. Much of the western Ukraine was once part of Poland, until it was incorporated into the Soviet Union after World War II. **********The Ukrainian Catholic Church was driven underground by Stalin in 1946. It was forcibly dissolved, and its parishes were closed or merged into the Russian Orthodox Church. Centered in the western Ukraine, the Ukrainian Catholics follow the Eastern liturgy but profess allegiance to the Pope. Gorbachev Promises New Law **********The Pope has insisted repeatedly that the Ukrainian Catholic Church be made legal again, and he got an important start toward that goal when Mr. Gorbachev promised him today that a new law guaranteeing freedom of conscience would soon be enacted. **********In turn, the Soviet leader won something he had come for: legitimacy from the leader of the world's 900 million Roman Catholics. It came in the form of a papal blessing for his plans to restructure Soviet political and economic life. John Paul said the Holy See ''wishes you success and declares itself ready to support every initiative that will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of individuals and peoples.'' Pope Stresses Liberty **********But the Pope's main concern was religious liberty, and he stuck to that point tenaciously, reminding Mr. Gorbachev that Moscow had signed international treaties guaranteeing freedom of worship. ''I express the fervent hope,'' he said, that Catholics in the Ukraine, the Baltic republics and Armenia will be able ''to practice freely their religious life.'' **********In his brief remarks, the Soviet leader said all believers ''have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs.'' On Thursday, he told Italian leaders that his country had made the mistake of treating religion in ''a simplistic manner.'' **********Developments such as these, the Pope said to him today, ''lead us to hope that the situation will change.'' **********Indeed, in the Ukranian city of Lvov, the layman who leads the Ukrainian Catholic Church reported that a major shift had already occurred. The leader, Ivan Hel, said that Ukraine officials had announced that the church could register like any other accepted religious organization. A Symbolic Crossing **********Beyond the immediate agendas of each leader, the meeting today in the ceremonial library of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace contained a symbolism of almost epic proportions. **********At an earlier time, Stalin had scornfully asked how many divisions the Pope had. Now, a successor intent on undoing Stalin's legacy has crossed St. Peter's Square in open recognition that he must reckon with the Vatican as a moral and political force. **********Certainly, the significance was not lost on either of the participants, who have many points in common. Both are Slavs. Both say spiritual values must go hand in hand with material gains. Both talk of a Europe unified by a common civilization despite political diversity. And both can maintain, in different ways, that their separate visions helped trigger the tumultuous changes under way across the Continent. Clasped Hands and Cameras **********The two symbol-conscious men were also aware of the power of photographs and televised images showing them clasping hands and appearing in the relaxed company of each another. **********''A truly extraordinary event has taken place,'' said the Communist leader, who was baptized as a boy in the Russian Orthodox Church. ''It has become possible due to the profound changes that are sweeping many countries and nations. What is more, we can expect it to help assure their positive continuation.'' **********''Our meeting today,'' the Pope said, ''will hardly fail to have a powerful impact on world opinion. Not only is it something new and unusual. **********''It will also be interpreted as singularly meaningful, a sign of the times that have slowly matured, a sign that is rich in promise,'' he said. Sharp Improvement With East **********For the Vatican, the Gorbachev visit crowned a year of dramatically improved relations with the Eastern bloc. **********The church has been permitted to make long prohibited ecclesiastical appointments in Czechoslovakia, and in the Soviet republics of Lithuania Byelorussia. Four months ago, it established diplomatic relations with Poland, its first with a Warsaw Pact nation. Last week, Hungary announced that it was ready to follow suit. **********But full Vatican relations with the Kremlin are expected to take considerably more time. Even so, it was a giant stride today when Mr. Gorbachev said, ''We have reached agreement in principle to give official status to our interstate relations.'' **********Asked later if this was a move toward full diplomatic relations, the chief Vatican spokesman, Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said it was. Smiles and Laughs **********While the meeting today was friendly - punctuated with smiles and occasional laughs - the two leaders did not show true warmth in public. Still, the special nature of the occasion shone through, even in small gestures. **********Mr. Gorbachev called the Pope ''Holy Father.'' For his part, John Paul varied his routine in a significant way. **********Normally, he greets visitors at the door of his library, which is on the second floor of the Apostolic Palace, one floor below his private apartment. To show his esteem for this guest, he came out several dozen yards from the library, to the Throne Room. **********Then they entered the library, sitting on either side of a wooden desk during a 70-minute conversation. For the first five minutes, according to Dr. Navarro, they were alone, speaking in Russian. But then they brought in interpreters, with Mr. Gorbachev continuing in Russian and the Pope alternating between Polish and Italian. Mrs. Gorbachev Calls **********While the two men talked, Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, toured the Sistine Chapel and the Raphael rooms of the Vatican Museum. Then she returned to meet the Pope, raising eyebrows by turning out in a bright red suit. It is customary for women to wear black at private papal audiences. But if the Vatican was displeased, it kept its feelings to itself. **********In an exchange of gifts, John Paul presented Mr. Gorbachev a reproduction of an early Christian mosaic showing Christ on St. Peter's tomb, and gave Mrs. Gorbachev rosary beads of gold and mother of pearl. In return, he received two 14th-century Psalm books from Kiev. **********Just before this exchange, Dr. Navarro said, the Soviet leader told the Pope, ''Holy Father, we are aware that we are dealing with the highest religious authority in the world but also someone who is a Slav.'' **********''Yes, I'm the first Slav Pope,'' John Paul reportedly replied, adding, ''I'm sure that Providence paved the way for this meeting.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/29/business/banks-bad-real-estate-loans-spur-rising-worry-of-failures.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1989-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1614, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banks' Bad Real Estate Loans Spur Rising Worry of Failures", "print_headline": "Banks' Bad Real Estate Loans Spur Rising Worry of Failures", "body_text": " **********Federal regulators and banking experts say they are increasingly concerned that mounting losses from troubled real estate loans could lead to a series of bank failures, straining the Federal insurance program that protects depositors' funds. **********The regulators and analysts worry that in a severe economic downturn the losses at commercial banks might overwhelm the deposit insurance fund. That would force the Government to choose between raising insurance fees on the banking industry or rescuing some banks with taxpayer money. **********The banks' real estate problems come on top of difficulties from other troubled loans, including losses on lending to developing countries and to other high-risk borrowers. 'Are of Real Concern' **********L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has issued stern warnings to bankers that real estate is ''an emerging area of real concern.'' The F.D.I.C. insures individual deposits up to $100,000 at commercial banks and is considered the front line of the Federal safety net. **********''I've been the Cassandra of real estate forecasting for some time now,'' Mr. Seidman told bankers at a meeting in New York this month. ''Unfortunately, events confirmed this view.'' **********Mr. Seidman and other experts say that in the last five years commercial banks have become alarmingly dependent on real estate loans. Such lending accounted for 25 percent of loans in 1985; it is approaching 40 percent this year. And two-thirds of all new lending is related to real estate. **********They note that with $3.22 trillion in assets the commercial banking system is three times as large as the savings and loan industry. The size of the banking sector means that even a limited number of failures could be a drain on the insurance fund. **********The weakness of some commercial banks with large real estate loans has been compared to the savings and loan crisis, but the industries are quite different. Savings institutions concentrate on real estate lending; banks have traditionally had much more diversified portfolios, lending to businesses and making personal loans as well as providing mortgages. **********No one predicts that the entire banking industry will suffer the depth of trouble that shook the savings industry in Texas, and the experts do not expect a comparable regulatory failure. Bank regulators have a much better record than their savings and loan counterparts in detecting and limiting problems. **********Still, regulators are getting tougher with banks in forcing them to set aside reserves for questionable loans. 'It's Pretty Damn Bad' **********Many bankers are also worried by the effect of bad real estate loans, but most say the problem can be limited. ''It's pretty damn bad, and I hear the regulators are being extraordinarily tough,'' said Malcolm T. Murray Jr., chief credit officer for the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. **********But Mr. Murray said he did not expect any big bank failures. ''There may be some hasty marriages,'' he said. ''But I am not sure the picture is quite as bleak as it has been painted.'' **********Charles T. Doyle, chief executive of the Gulf National Bank in Texas City, Tex., added: ''I am not overly gloomy. It is not anywhere near the kind of problem we were faced with in Texas.'' **********Some regulators, among them Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, are taking a somewhat reassuring tone. They have announced new computer monitoring procedures and systems aimed at detecting problems much earlier at banks exposed to real estate losses. **********Yet besides Mr. Seidman, some respected members of Congress on banking matters are also deeply concerned. ''You have a financial system that is at risk, and it is extremely serious,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. Two Things Needed **********Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow and banking specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said two things were needed ''to turn the banking problem into one of the magnitude of the thrifts.'' In his view, ''you need a moderate to significant recession and a reluctance by Congress to put new money into the F.D.I.C. and allow a lot of insolvent institutions to stay open.'' **********At this point the F.D.I.C. can easily absorb losses from small failures. But the failure of only a few large banks could cost the fund dearly. **********If the insurance fund, which now has about $14 billion, is run down, pressures would first build on the banks to pay higher insurance premiums. Later, Congress would be likely to be asked to approve more money for the fund - money that, as in the savings bailout, would come from taxpayers. **********Some analysts have wondered if Mr. Seidman is trying to prepare the industry for what he sees as the inevitable increases in deposit insurance premiums that his agency was empowered to impose under the savings and loan bailout legislation. **********''It is conceivable that even a moderate deterioriation could have debilitating effects on the F.D.I.C.,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, a financial consultant in San Francisco. A Growing Dependence **********What is troubling many experts, including Mr. Clarke, the Comptroller, is the growing dependence on real estate lending over the last half decade. **********In the Northeast, the region with the most new real estate lending, many loans went to developers of condominiums and apartment buildings - financing that is always larger and riskier than single-family mortgages - and were issued by larger regional banks. Until recently, the big regional banks were considered the new wave of banking, replacing the huge international banks, like Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover. **********The seriousness of the problem in the Northeast seems to have taken even some top officers of regional banks by surprise. **********Senior officials at the Bank of New England, for example, were buying stock in the big Boston-based bank, with assets of $31 billion, only weeks before it said it would have to set aside $700 million against possible losses on its real estate loans. **********Then last week, only days after the Bank of New England report, three other big Northeast banking institutions - Dime Savings of New York: Midlantic, the second-largest banking concern in New Jersey, and Citytrust Bancorp of Bridgeport, Conn. - said they would create unexpectedly large loan-loss reserves. **********The softening in real estate, and the impact on banks, appear to be reaching beyond the Northeast, however. Mr. Clarke has said that his office sees growing weakness in parts of the booming Florida market. Arizona real estate, particularly in Phoenix and Tucson, has plummeted this year. And some experts see the West Coast as vulnerable soon. 'Bicoastal Devaluation' **********''I look at the possibility that you are going to see a bicoastal devaluation in real estate,'' Representative Leach of Iowa said. **********The potential for trouble in the banking industry as a whole is compounded by several factors. **********One is the savings bailout itself. For the next five years at least, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created to manage the liquidation and sale of hundreds of ailing institutions, will have more than $140 billion in half-built apartment buildings, undeveloped land, homes and other troubled assets to sell - the equivalent of almost all the assets of the nation's largest bank, Citibank. This prospect will keep prices depressed and tie up investment capital. **********Another factor is the condition of the global banking giants. Though banks like Citibank and Chase Manhattan do not have as big a chunk of their holdings in real estate as the large regional banks, they still have their share, and they continue to be bogged down by third world debt. Squeeze on Profitability **********Finally, laws that have prohibited banks from diversifying into securities underwriting and insurance, as well as geographic diversification, have placed what Mr. Clarke considers an alarming squeeze on profitability, putting pressure on banks to seek higher-risk investments. Among these investments have been ''junk bonds'' and highly leveraged transactions; the banking industry in recent months has suffered large losses on such loans. **********Other regulators said they were concerned about a marked drop in credit standards. Banks' willingness to lend to businesses they might have turned down several years ago creates the potential for high losses. **********''We have systemic problems with profitability,'' Mr. Clarke said in an interview last week. ''And the extent to which the necessity for earnings is forcing banks into high-risk lending.'' **********Some banking experts note that concern about real estate is affecting the way regulators are working. Mindful of the criticism of M. Danny Wall, who resigned recently as the Government's top savings regulator, some examiners are prompted to force banks to take large losses on their real estate holdings to avoid being accused of underestimating the risks or going easy on certain institutions, these experts say. **********Some bankers and analysts say the strains are already appearing as regulators try to get a grasp on how much the real estate market has fallen in key areas. ''These markets have deterioriated a lot faster than people thought at midyear, but I feel that in recent months the regulators have turned up the volume too much,'' said James McDermott, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''They have become vocal and very visible, and though their point is well taken, they are tending to undermine confidence in financial institutions.''

Gardner, and those by two other men were significant developments that would move the Pentagon fraud inquiry forward ''at a tremendous pace.'' Dummy Companies Used **********In the court documents, prosecutors say some of the money from the Unisys fund was channeled through dummy companies in the Caribbean and offshore Britain to buy an Idaho vacation home at an inflated price from the Pentagon official, Melvyn R. Paisley. Mr. Paisley oversaw much of the Navy's contracting work from 1981 to 1986, when he was assistant secretary for research, engineering and systems. **********Mr. Paisley's lawyers, E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. and Robert Plotkin, issued a statement today denying that their client was knowingly bribed ''by Charles Gardner or anyone else while at the Navy.'' Mr. Paisley believes his condominium was sold at its fair market value, they stated. **********Mr. Paisley has not been charged with any crimes in connection with the inquiry. **********Unisys reacted angrily to the disclosures. In a statement from its headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., a spokesman said the company was outraged and planned to sue Mr. Gardner, whom it accused of deliberate fraud. The fund was begun when Mr. Gardner was an employee of the Sperry Corporation, before its merger with the Burroughs Corporation in 1986. The merged company was later renamed Unisys. **********In United States District Court in Alexandria, Mr. Gardner pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiring to file false statements and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. The charges stem mostly from a single use of the Unisys fund to bribe Mr. Paisley in August 1986. Mr. Gardner ran the company's Surveillance and Fire Control Division in Great Neck, Long Island, from 1985 until last March. **********Another Virginia consultant implicated in the contracting scandal, James G. Neal, pleaded guilty to lesser charges with Mr. Gardner in court today. Cooperation With Inquiry **********Both men and a third defendant have agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation, which centers on the use of private consultants by corporations to pay bribes to Pentagon officials and others who could influence awards of military contracts. **********The court papers said Mr. Gardner effectively controlled the use of the Unisys fund and used it ''for purposes of bribery, illegal campaign contributions and in part for Charles F. Gardner's personal use.'' **********The fund was replenished by charging the Government for consulting work on military contracts that was not needed or even performed, Mr. Hudson said. As outlined in court documents, Mr. Gardner bilked the Pentagon out of its own money, which he then used to bribe the Pentagon's own officials. **********The documents charge that Mr. Paisley ''performed certain official acts'' to help Unisys obtain contracts for the Aegis electronic warfare system and a Marine Corps air traffic control system. **********Mr. Gardner, Mr. Paisley and a private consultant, William M. Galvin, have emerged as central figures in the inquiry disclosed in June. **********In a scheme rivaling any crime-novel plot, Mr. Gardner admitted that he paid off Mr. Paisley by arranging for Mr. Neal to buy Mr. Paisley's Idaho vacation home at an inflated price. **********Mr. Hudson said the purchase money from the Unisys fund was laundered through cutouts and dummy companies in secretive locales, like the Guernsey Islands and the Isle of Man off Britain and the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos in the Carribean. Plea Bargain **********Although Mr. Neal joined in the scheme, he was not charged with bribing Mr. Paisley. Under a plea-bargain, he was allowed to admit to a lesser crime in exchange for his cooperation. **********Mr. Neal pleaded guilty to paying off another Navy official, Garland L. Tomlin Jr., by sending $400,000 of the Unisys money in 1983 and 1984 to a dummy company owned by Mr. Tomlin in the Bahamas. Mr. Tomlin is said to have demanded $500,000 from Mr. Neal in return for help on a multimillion-dollar subcontract for Unisys. **********A Navy spokesman said Mr. Tomlin was an engineer with the Naval Electronic Systems Command until May 1985 and later worked for the Naval Sea Systems Command until he resigned that October. He was reported today by a knowledgeable attorney in the case to be living in Switzerland. Independent efforts to locate him were unsuccessful. **********Mr. Neal carried out the purchase of Mr. Paisley's condominium at the Sun Valley ski resort for $149,000. He arranged to sell the home less than a year later to an unrelated buyer for $100,000, or a $49,000 loss, according to the documents. **********According to the court documents released today, the scheme was instigated by William Galvin, a consultant to military contractors and close friend of Mr. Paisley since the early 1980's. Like Mr. Neal, Mr. Galvin dealt with Mr. Gardner's Long Island Unisys division. **********In a statement issued today, Mr. Galvin's lawyer, William Nussbaum, said any charge that his client bribed Government officials or joined in a bribery scheme was false. Money Laundering **********The court documents said the purchase had been laundered through a dizzying assembly of companies set up by Mr. Neal years earlier at Mr. Gardner's instructions. **********To buy Mr. Paisley's home, the documents stated, Mr. Neal transferred $180,000 from six of his firms to Weighbridge Trust, a company in the Guernsey Islands, a bank secrecy haven off Britain. Weighbridge moved the money to Surrey Investments Ltd., a Cayman Islands firm that Mr. Neal had purchased in 1983, and Surrey then purchased Mr. Paisley's condominum in the name of yet another firm, Pathway Investments, based in Idaho. **********Although that transaction cost only $149,000, more than $5 million was funneled from Unisys into Mr. Neal's companies through consulting agreements. Some $1.7 million of that money was moved to a Virginia company owned by Mr. Gardner, AVC Associates, the documents indicate. Another $160,000 was used to buy a town house in suburban Reston, Virginia, outside Washington, which was rented to a Unisys employee. **********Mr. Neal pleaded guilty today to tax evasion, filing false claims to the Government and conspiring both to bribe Mr. Tomlin and to make false claims. The offenses carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. **********The third individual who pleaded guilty today, Kenneth F. Brooke of Vienna, Va., admitted a single charge of evading Federal taxes in 1985. The charge stemmed from his role in a Norfolk, Va. real estate deal and was not believed related to the Pentagon bribery scheme or the Unisys fund. He could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined up to $250,000. **********Mr. Brooke offered the plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors to cooperate in the Pentagon inquiry. He is Mr. Galvin's stepson and was employed as an accountant by one of Mr. Galvin's consulting firms. **********Mr. Gardner faces up to 23 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 in connection with his guilty pleas. **********Mr. Gardner's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said his client ''has admitted his guilt to the crimes he committed for the benefit of his employer, Unisys,'' and that he ''is very contrite and remorseful.'' **********Mr. Neal's lawyer declined to comment on the charges or his client's guilty plea."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/02/world/china-party-s-birthday-festivities-in-minor-key.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1989-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Party's Birthday: Festivities in Minor Key", "print_headline": "China Party's Birthday: Festivities in Minor Key", "body_text": " **********China today celebrated the 68th anniversary of the founding of its Communist Party with songs and dances, special television programs and even the reopening of some tourist sites and parks bordering Beijing's Tiananmen Square. **********The square had been closed since the supression of what is called the ''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' about four weeks ago. But today schoolchildren were there singing Communist hymns and a couple in army uniforms were dancing in front of the red flag of China; then a long and solemn line of soldiers laid a wreath to the memory of their comrades fallen in the recent quelling of pro-democracy protests here. Festivities Seem a Bit Forced **********It was in many ways the normal celebration for this annual event in China. And yet, taking place so soon after the crackdown by the army against protesters, which left hundreds dead, the festivities themselves seemed to be just a bit forced and shadowed by the mood of tension and sadness that, in contrast with the official ambiance of celebration, still grips this city. **********Foremost among the sites newly reopened, for example, was the rostrum of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the imperial red structure that leads into the Forbidden City on one side and, on the other, commands a view of Tiananmen Square, which a month ago was the site of a tent city set up by protesters. **********Early this morning, hundreds of people clambered up the gate - paying a fee of $2.50 per Chinese, $8 for foreigners - where they sought autographs from Wang Fuyi, a martial law commander. A group of American tourists was interviewed and shown later on the televised evening news, part of China's continuing campaign to present the situation as normal and peaceful. Vast, Empty Esplanade **********But, by noon, with the formal festivities over, there were only a few people visible on the rostrum, and those that were there looked across at a vast, empty esplanade, blocked off by armed troops standing behind low metal grills. Normally there would be thousands of strollers and kite-flyers there, but today pedestrians were not even allowed on the broad avenues or sidewalks on either side of the square. **********During an officially sponsored trip to a rural area outside Beijing, a police escort was asked when normal journalistic activities might resume. The guard said, ''Martial law is going to be in effect for a very long time.'' **********Asked what it depends on, the policeman replied, ''They decide up there,'' waving his hand in an upward direction to indicate the higher reaches of the party leadership. **********The mood of unease was palpable in many ways today. Outside the American Embassy, where the July Fourth weekend was being observed, an unusually large number of armed police were present, newly equipped with pistols. Previously the police guarding embassies had been unarmed. Students Reticent **********The mood was also palpable at the universities, where a month ago students were in a frenzy of organization, preparing banners and marches through the streets to the square. Several students at the Beijing Normal University were approached individually on Friday, but each said it was not possible to talk now. **********''There are plainclothes police around,'' a student whispered just before riding off on a bicycle. ''You should understand our position.'' **********In the last few days, the universities have been quiet places occupied only by fourth-year students about to get their diplomas. Soldiers and security police have been present, arrests have been made and interrogations are taking place. A foreign student who has done some work for foreign journalists was picked up by four policemen early Friday morning and interrogated for several hours about his activities before being allowed to return to his dormitory. **********At the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, where foreign and Chinese students normally mingle freely, the Chinese students have been given explicit instructions to stop fraternizing. A Canadian professor there said: ''The foreign teachers have been told not to involve themselves in something that is an internal affair of China, meaning that we should have nothing to do outside of classes with our students. Naturally we don't obey that restriction.'' Organized Visits to Square **********''We are keeping a close eye on our students so we will know if any of them are arrested,'' he said. ''But I've been told that as soon as we go, and we are leaving in a couple of weeks, the arrests will pick up.'' **********In opening some tourist sites and parks around Tiananmen Square, the municipal authorities said that the square itself would be open for organized visits only, the first of them being the tightly controlled demonstrations that took place this morning. The effort to restore normalcv coexists with an effort to maintain tight control, which, in some ways, is being extended into new areas. **********Friday, for example, the authorities at the Beijing Great Wall Sheraton Hotel abruptly shut down the Cable News Network service that is received there by a satellite dish. ''Higher authorities ordered it,'' a member of the hotel management said, adding that the same order would soon be applied in the other international-class hotels here that still offer the service. **********Since the hotels are reserved almost entirely for foreign guests, the authorities' move suggested a worry that the Chinese staff might watch, and be influenced by, the broadcasts. For weeks already, local hotel employees have been searched as they left their jobs to make sure they are not carrying foreign or Hong Kong newspapers with them. 'Deserved the Punishment' **********It is against this background that such ceremonies as the laying of wreaths for the soldiers killed in the suppression of the democracy movement are taking place. Those protesters killed in the army operation are unworthy of mourning, according to Chinese leaders; Beijing's Mayor, Chen Xitong, said Friday that they ''deserved the punishment.'' **********''Some friends suffered the loss of a family member and I asked if I could see them,'' said Ann Thurston, a scholar of China who has been here for nearly two months, ''but they wouldn't come near me.'' **********''Their friends told me that they just got a glimpse of their family member's body before it was taken away for cremation,'' she said. ''That was all they got. They are forbidden to mourn, and, if you remember how important the ritual of mourning the death of a loved one is in China, you will realize what a terrible thing they must be going through.'' Television Tribute to Party **********The invisible, silent mourners went unrecognized in a splashy television special commemmorating the party's anniversary. It was called ''The People's Army Salutes the Party'' and consisted largely of songs sung by large armed forces choruses and individuals to the members of the Communist Party Politburo, all of whom seemed to be present. **********In a departure from the formal styles of the past, a couple of popular songs were sung as white lights blinked around a great red flag inside the auditorium. But mostly the event was staged as a show of solemn fealty to the party, with numbers like ''I Bear Arms for the People'' and ''The People's Navy Marches Forward'' dominating the lighter songs.."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/17/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Carpenter Technology Corp., Reading, Pa., an industrial-products manufacturer, named Robert W.

Falling Trade Barriers **********Bush Administration officials predict that laundering activities will further increase in Canada as trade barriers are phased out between the two countries under a sweeping free-trade agreement that began to go into effect this year. Canada and the United States already have the largest two-nation trade relationship, and the Administration officials added that the expansion of commerce between the two that is encouraged by the new agreement is expected to provide a useful mask to conceal more drug-money transactions. **********The report said that cash carried across the border and electronic transfers between American and Canadian banks are the most common ways the money is being moved. **********''Canada does not fit the profile of the typical financial haven nation, yet it has been a repository for drug monies in recent years as a result of certain anomalies in Canadian law,'' the report said, noting that the country's statutes have no requirements for reporting money that enters or leaves the country. ''Canada's stable political climate, reasonably strong currency and well-developed banking system make it an attractive repository or transshipment point for the movement of drug profits from U.S. drug organizations.'' **********It added that the risk of detection is not high because of the enormous movement of cars across the generally open 5,500-mile border. Fears of Publicizing Report **********The report, which officials of the drug agency said they had hoped to keep confidential out of fears that publicity would further encourage drug traffickers to use Canadian banks, came to light at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations. John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee, obtained a copy of the report and cited it as depicting ''a friendly country whose bankers are thumbing their noses at our banking laws.'' **********In Toronto and Montreal, officials at the Canadian Bankers Association, a lobbying and trade organization that represents the nation's largest banks, declined to comment on the report or on Mr. Kerry's remarks. Members of the Senate subcommittee staff said representatives of Canadian banks had declined invitations to appear at the hearing. No specific Canadian banks were identified in the report as being intentionally involved in laundering drug profits. **********Unlike in the United States, the Canadian banking industry is heavily concentrated around about a half-dozen leading banks. The report indicated that both large and small banks are being increasingly used. **********Under a provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the Treasury Department must negotiate with foreign countries to obtain stronger cooperation and coordination of money laundering investigations and regulations. The Treasury is required to issue findings later this year on progress it has made and on nations that should be sanctioned for failing to cooperate. Testimony Next Week **********Treasury officials are scheduled to testify next week and are expected to be questioned by the subcommittee on the Bush Administration's views about the growing Canadian problem. **********The Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is directed by William Bennett, is expected to announce the formation of a committee next month to identify international and domestic money laundering problems. The committee will consist of senior officials from various Federal departments and agencies, including Justice, Treasury, State and the National Security Council, and its findings are expected to form the basis for policy and specific regulatory recommendations. **********In the United States, banks must file reports for currency transactions involving more than $10,000, but Canada has no such law. **********Within the last year Canada has adopted laws that permit officials to freeze suspected assets and have them forfeited for convictions of money laundering. The new laws also make money laundering a crime for the first time in Canada, though American authorities believe the laws are not as effective as those in the United States. **********Several recent investigations have disclosed significant ties between money laundering operations by drug dealers in the United States and Latin America who have made use of Canadian banks, many of which have branches throughout Latin America. Federal authorities say that Operation Polar Cap, the largest money laundering investigation in American history, uncovered more than $1.2 billion that was laundered over an 18-month period, some of which went through banks in Toronto. Panama Bank Convicted **********In that case, Canadian law-enforcement authorities working closely with American officials received $1 million from assets that were forfeited after the conviction last month in Atlanta of a Panamanian bank, Banco de Occidente, on money laundering charges. **********Terrence M. Burke, a deputy assistant administrator of the drug agency, testified at the hearing that the increased use of Canada to launder drug money represents a shifting pattern. Historically, he said, Latin American nations, as well as Hong Kong and Switzerland, have been havens of money laundering because of their bank secrecy laws. **********He also said that investigations had shown that money launderers and drug traffickers were not shy about having the American banks they use file currency transaction reports. **********''They know that the volume is of such a magnitude that we are getting virtually no leads,'' Mr. Burke said. ''The system itself is overwhelmed by the fact that there are so many legitimate transactions over $10,000 that are being filed.'' **********More than seven million currency transaction forms are now being filed annually with the Federal Government, up from fewer than 100,000 a decade ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/20/business/executive-changes-222889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Bain & Co., Boston, a management consulting firm, promoted Pete Dawkins, the retired Army brigadier general and football star, and Pat Graham to vice chairman posts. *********** Chemical Banking Corp. named Kenneth L.

Tyson Foods, the spurned suitor, asked the judge yesterday to void the auction, arguing that ''never in the history of corporate auctions has a process been so mishandled.'' **********Conagra Inc., the apparent winner and only bidder in the weekend auction, offered a swap of 2.1 shares of its stock for each share of Holly Farms. With Conagra shares falling $2, to $33.625, in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, that offer is now worth $70.61 a share, or $1.2 billion. Holly Farms shares rose $4.50, to $67.125. **********The first auction rules called for bids from Conagra and Tyson, contingent on a separate deal between Conagra and Holly that would end a lockup agreement that gave Conagra the right to buy several parts of Holly in the event of a takeover. It is that lockup, which Judge Hartnett has indicated is illegal, that has prevented Tyson from going ahead with a $63.50-a-share offer for Holly. **********But Conagra's bid provided for no such settlement, and about 7:30 Friday evening, Holly told Tyson to bid only if it was willing to place no conditions regarding the lockup. It was given until noon Saturday to respond to the second set of rules. **********After Tyson refused to bid under those conditions on Saturday, and did not get a response, Tyson officials say their team dispersed from the New York offices of their lawyers, Skadden, Arps. One went to see the sights, an official said, and a letter from Holly's lawyers, setting out the third set of auction rules, went unnoticed for a few hours after it arrived by telecopier. That letter asked for a bid with any conditions Tyson might want to attach. **********When it was noticed, the lawyers asked for more time, and were given a 10 P.M. Saturday deadline. The Tyson lawyers responded that they needed until morning but were rebuffed. ''It was clear to the board that an improvement in price was not forthcoming,'' said Ted Bailey, a Holly spokesman. Tyson officials said that could not have been clear, and noted that under terms of the Conagra bid, the Holly board had until Monday morning to accept it. **********''They do not want us to be the winning bidder under any circumstances,'' said Jim Blair, a Tyson counsel. ''That is clear.'' Mr. Bailey said one reason for the Saturday night haste, with the merger agreement signed around 11:30 P.M., was Holly fears that Conagra and Tyson would cut a deal canceling the lockup agreement and allowing Tyson to buy Holly. **********A continuing effort to reach such a deal was made last week, with both sides saying the other backed away from agreed positions to prevent an accord. The talks were still going on when Conagra abruptly informed Tyson that it had made a bid and was no longer interested in talking to Tyson. **********The Conagra bid came as a surprise, said J. Michael Schell, a partner at Skadden, Arps, in part because that morning The Wall Street Journal had reported that a Conagra spokesman had said the company ''planned to skip the auction.'' **********A spokeswoman for Conagra, Lynn Pharas, said The Journal had been told ''we had no present intention'' of making a bid, which she said was slightly different from what was printed. She said that Tyson should not have been surprised by the bid, and added that the company had seen no reason to ask the Dow Jones News Service to clarify or correct the article. **********In its court papers filed yesterday, Tyson argued that ''Conagra's statements were false and were intended to cause the trading price of its shares to increase before the weekend 'auction,' thus maximizing the nominal value of the stock bid it actually intended to make.'' In fact, Conagra's shares did rise 87.5 cents on Friday, in apparent relief that the company would not bid at levels many analysts think are higher than what Holly is worth. **********The betting on Wall Street now is that the judge will find a way to let Tyson have another crack at the company, but that the latest bid has moved the price up another notch. In any case, a resolution of the takeover battle does not appear near. **********Or as Mr. Bailey of Holly put it yesterday. ''It's like Yogi Berra said, 'It ain't over till it's over.'

'Colossal Savings' Seen **********The idea of paying scarce foreign currency to Soviet farmers instead of American grain traders has been promoted by several independent economists here as a way of easing the country's foreign debt and diverting money to consumer imports. **********Nikolai P. Shmelyov, an economist who has pressed for more far-reaching measures to revive the economy, said in June that paying farmers instead of foreign grain merchants could bring ''colossal savings of foreign exchange.'' **********''Ours are a modest people,'' Mr. Shmelyov said in a speech to the Congress of People's Deputies. ''I am sure that we do not need to pay them $200 per ton of grain'' - the approximate cost of imported wheat. ''Seventy-five dollars would do. They will sell for that.'' What the Farmers Will Get **********Tass said farmers would be paid convertible currencies worth 40 to 60 rubles per ton of wheat - $64 to $96 at the official exchange rate - depending on the variety, which would be in the general price range Mr. Shmelyov suggested. **********Farmers are also to receive foreign currency for sunflowers, soya and several other crops used for vegetable oil and feed. **********Tass said the farms will be free to spend the money as they wish, either for equipment to increase production or for imported goods to reward their workers. **********Under more liberal rules adopted last year, Soviet individuals and businesses are allowed to have foreign-currency bank accounts, but they must be able to show that they acquired the money legally, through such means as exports, royalties or payments from foreign employers. The Dollar's High Value **********The craving for imported goods here is so intense that a dollar officially worth six-tenths of a ruble now sells for about 10 rubles on the black market. **********Foreign computers, currently the hottest item on the illicit market, sell at such extravagant prices that the Government recently imposed a stiff tariff on those brought into the country. A computer that costs about $1,000 in a Western discount store sells here for 40,000 rubles or more - $64,000 at the legal exchange rate. **********But no economic problem is more acutely embarrassing to the Government than the country's inability to feed itself. **********Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, speaking to the Congress of People's Deputies in June before the new grain program was announced, estimated that the Soviet Union would spend about $8 billion on imports of grain and other food this year, including 44 million tons of grain from the West and one-fifth of the country's vegetable oil. **********''These purchases have us by the throat,'' he said. Minister on a Buying Spree **********The Government today made no estimate of how much it hopes to save from the experiment. **********Mr. Shmelyov, who is a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, urged that the Government use its savings to buy foreign electronics, appliances, fashionable clothes and cosmetics to persuade the disenchanted public that Mr. Gorbachev's economic program is paying off. **********Economists both here and abroad have argued that imported consumer products could be sold here at high ruble prices, sopping up unspent savings that have contributed to inflation. **********Under pressure of public demand, the Government has increased its spending on imported goods in recent months, including a well-publicized buying spree last month in which Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandra P.

Factory Equipment Preferred **********Although the Soviet Union is considered a prime credit risk by foreign lenders, Mr. Ryzhkov and other Government leaders have warned that the money should be used to buy factory equipment that will make the country more self-sufficient rather than for immediate gratification. **********''We have no need to rob our grandchildren,'' he said.

He begged the home audience to heed their souls, to ''hear the silence that carries healing and creative force.'' **********Thus is the state's long oppression of religion, the decades of Lenin's angry prescription of an ''assault on heaven,'' being interrupted every other week for a 15-minute nationwide sermonette, albeit one noticeably short of the specific mention of God. **********The unusual show, called ''Thoughts on the Eternal: Sunday Moral Sermon,'' is the latest step in the Soviet Union's gradual, pragmatic retreat from harsh restrictions on religion. The show's Communist producers promise they soon will allow a Muslim imam, a rabbi and assorted other spiritual leaders to take the electronic pulpit. Religion Has Edge on Perestroika **********In the nearly five years since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power, religious change has in some ways been making steadier progress in reviving Soviet society than has perestroika, the Soviet leader's ambitious program of economic ad political restructuring. After the Stalin and Khrushchev eras of religious oppression, people are flocking to the churches that the state has been reopening at an ever-faster rate - 937 last year, compared with only 10 in 1987. **********Nationally, 8,500 Russian Orthodox churches are now open, and about 20 more are being restored each week. This represents an increase of about one-third in the last few years, though the number is still far short of the 50,000 churches that existed before the revolution of 1917. **********New laws no longer ban bell ringing and charitable activities, and new religious organizations are coming forward, though they are still required to apply for state approval. With church buildings being returned, parishoners have begun restoration projects ranging from the gilt, onion-shaped domes to the baptismal fonts. Local congregations are growing, although with discreet concern that people's careers have been damaged in the past by accusations of religious affiliation. Problems for Muslims and Jews **********All this change do not constitute the establishment of full freedom of worship, particularly for the Jews, Protestants, Muslims and other groups or denominations traditionally less tolerated. The robust Ukrainian Catholic Church, for example, continues to operate clandestinely, in the shadows of a 40-year state ban. **********The number of registered Islamic communities plummeted during the crackdowns of the Stalin and Khrushchev eras, but they are resurging in strongholds of the faith like the Azerbaijan republic, where there were 2,000 mosques before the 1917 revolution but only 18 two years ago. **********This total is expected to triple in two years, but the growth rate, hobbled by the state, will still fail to satisfy demand, according to Muslim officials. They note that their faith long has survived in unofficial ways. **********For Jews, the statistics have been even more discouraging - 109 registered communities in 1987, compared with 259 in 1961 - despite the Government's recent effort after decades of anti-Semitism to occasionally highlight an isolated event like the opening of a Jewish cultural center. **********The status of the Ukrainian church, which Stalin feared as a vehicle of Ukrainian nationalism, is a major concern of Pope John Paul II, who is expected to press for its legalization when he meets with Mr. Gorbachev on Friday at the Vatican. The Pope presumably will also be seeing to the interests of the thriving Catholic Church in the Baltic republics, where separatist movements have the Kremlin alarmed. A Longing for Spiritual Respite **********State control of religion remains considerable under highly restrictive 1929 laws - from oversight of the clergy to limits on the publishing of Bibles. Although atheism was not enshrined in the Bolshevik Constitution, party members who were required to be godless. Some have lapsed in recent years, particularly as Mr. Gorbachev pledged greater tolerance and invoked God's name in occasionally folksy references. **********The Soviet leader has said that mistakes were made about religion and that the errors should be rectified. But a proposal by the Soviet Government to alter the status of religion and to codify freedom of conscience has not yet been enacted. No one knows what form such a measure would take. But as proposed, it would guarantee the right of churches to exist as legal entities with less state interference and would remove restrictions on religious education, among other changes. **********The new show suggests that Mr. Gorbachev, in contrast to Marx, who denounced religion's ''illusory happiness,'' may sense that the Soviet people need some spiritual respite, if only as a pragmatic adjunct to his own campaign for a resurgence of willpower and industry. **********Thus far, the sermon shows have amounted to a kind of mauve pantheism, with the cleric, a poet and a philosopher speaking of a universal context to life, of a sense of celebration in stepping back from the workaday world and sensing there is something more to existence. Only a Sepulchral Hint of God **********''What every person needs now, what the whole of our society needs now, is the unity apprehended in the deep quietness of internal self-cognition,'' said the first preacher, Metropolitan Pitirim of the Russian Orthodox Church. He did not mention God, but his sepulchral baritone and richly traditional garb sent a strong message of theism to viewers. **********''This all started with great caution,'' said the show's producer, Natalya G. Chernyshov, a Communist Party member. She discussed God and man under perestroika as she sat in her office beneath an image of Dali's crucified Christ. ''In my 20 years in television, such ideas had never been presented on the screen.'' she said, emphasizing that the speakers are free to say what they pleased. **********She acknowledged, however, that the performances are taped and screened before they are aired on television, and that a number of tapes had already been rejected. But Miss Chernyshov insisted that segments were culled only for effectiveness, not because of controversial content. **********It was the introduction of freer political speech and writing that demonstrated the need for a spiritual program, but one devoid of accusations, she said. Can't Live on Negativism **********''Under perestroika, everybody started criticizing everything,'' Miss Chernyshov said. ''We are very good at criticism in this country, but it turned out that was not enough. People cannot live only on negativism.'' **********The show does comes across as a respite from the Government importunings to support perestroika that are heard so often.''Verbosity does not provide salvation,'' is the way that Metropolitan Pitirim gently put it. **********It is no surprise that a poll by the show's producers questioning viewers on their preferred Sunday sermonizers ranked Mr. Gorbachev, with his own limitless supply of TV preaching time, 123d, with the Pope nine spots ahead at 114. **********Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and human rights campaigner, was among the most requested, with Mother Teresa and Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's nemesis, neck and neck in the top 10. **********The other preferences of the nation's new TV congregation ranged beyond religious figures. They include a bellydancer, an articulate ballerina and a professional clown, none of whom is yet guaranteed a spot on ''Thoughts on the Eternal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/25/business/company-news-pan-am-planning-friendly-nwa-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Pan Am Planning Friendly NWA Bid", "print_headline": "Company News; Pan Am Planning Friendly NWA Bid", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Pan Am Corportion, Thomas G.

But this majority, led by the Parliament Speaker and commander of the army, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, continues to be hampered by alliances of hard-line clerics and other leaders who are preventing the country from formulating a coherent foreign and domestic policy. **********The Iranian affairs experts agree that the role of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as supreme religious and policial guide of the Islamic revolution is fading in favor of a republican regime that will likely lead revolutionary Iran in its second decade and will have executive power resting with pragmatists rather than ideologues. **********These are some of the conclusions of an international panel of experts assembled from Britain, Iraq, Iran, the United States, the Soviet Union and Pakistan, among other places, who met at the British Royal Institute of International Affairs for a two-day conference, ''The Iranian Revolution: Ten Years Later.'' Birth Rate of 4% Annually **********One of the participating experts, Mahmoud Sari Olghalam, an Iranian professor of international relations at the University of Shahid Beheshti, in Teheran, said, ''The most important change is the one happening inside the clergy as they adopt to the reality of the international system and debate how to set the border line between divine law and statecraft.'' **********Faced with an annual birth rate of 4 percent, one of the highest in the world, and the enormous damage the country suffered in eight years of fighting, as well as the revolutionary chaos of a decade, Iran is turning to the West and the East looking for credits, commerce, technology and industrial aid. Its leadership accepts that the price for the help is to moderate its behavior in world affairs. **********According to the experts, Iran is likely to meet with a grudging response from both the Soviet and Western blocs until it fulfills a long list of assurances. **********Among these are Iran's bringing about the release of the remaining Western hostages, most of whom are believed held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon; the firm commitment to end all attempts to undermine the pro-Western Arab gulf countries, and the clear abstention from fomenting trouble among the Muslim ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union. 'No One Wants to Lend' **********Pauline Jackson, a British economic consultant who lived in Iran for 33 years and who edits a publication called Iran Monitor, said: ''The reason Iran is not borrowing money is that no one wants to lend it money. Commercial banks will not take the lead on lending to Iran until they get the green light from the governments.'' **********Ms. Jackson estimated that Iran will need $15 billion this year simply to satisfy its basic economic needs while its revenues from oil and other exports will not exceed $8 billion to $9 billion. **********Iran's weakest point appears to be its army, which has two components, the 220,000-member regular army and the 300,000-member Revolutionary Guards. Neither unit possess much in weapons compared with the countries surrounding Iran, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey. **********Anoushiravan Ehteshami, an Iranian military affairs research fellow at the Gulf Center for Strategic Studies of the University of Exeter in England, said: ''Purely in military-balance terms, Iran today is very weak. Take airpower alone: it is surrounded by countries that possess hundreds of MIG-29's, Tornedos, Mirage F-1's, Sukhoi 25's, several kinds of missiles and surveillance aircrafts. The advantage is overwhelming.'' A Sectarian Movement **********For these reasons, many experts here believe Iran has an interest in mending its fences with its gulf neighbors and the world at large. **********Although many of the experts said that Iran's revolution had had some lasting impact outside its borders, most agreed that its appeal to fellow Muslims, has remained sectarian -primarily Shiite - in nature instead of revolutionary and inspirational. **********Prof. Khalid Bin Sayeed, a Pakistani expert on Islamic resurgence and fundamentalism at Queen's University in Canada, said: ''One of the reasons the initial Shiite demonstrations did not develop into a revolutionary movement and tended to deteriorate into acts of sabotage was that the clarion call for revolution that Iran had given did not fall on very responsive Sunni ears.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/24/business/economic-scene-markets-puzzling-over-3-riddles.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1989-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 952, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Markets Puzzling Over 3 Riddles", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Markets Puzzling Over 3 Riddles", "body_text": " **********THREE interconnected riddles are worrying business and the markets: How serious is the inflationary threat? How high will interest rates go? And will rising interest rates produce a recession before the year is over or early next year? **********Concerns about inflation were intensified at the start of the week by last Friday's report that the Producer Price Index had risen a full percentage point in February, after the same increase in January. If that pace were to continue all year, the American economy would be back to double-digit inflation. The markets reeled at the thought. **********Fears were quickly calmed by the subsequent report that the Consumer Price Index had risen by just four-tenths of 1 percent in February, slightly less than the market had expected. So the markets again firmed up. Billions of dollars ride these days on decimal-point changes in seasonally adjusted sample surveys of price data. But yesterday, the stock market stumbled again, with the Dow losing 20.17 points. The decline was attributed to continuing worries about inflation. **********How strong is the underlying inflationary trend? With the economy close to full employment and full capacity use, and with a good deal of pressure still coming from the budget deficit, the answer is fairly strong and rising. Unit labor costs are moving upward at an annual rate of nearly 5 percent. And 5 percent still looks like the most probable figure for the rise in consumer prices for 1989, although some economists think a 6 percent rate is possible. Even a 5 percent rise represents acceleration; consumer prices rose by 1.9 percent in 1986, 3.7 percent in 1987 and 4.1 percent in 1988. **********The current inflationary trend is being racheted by higher oil and food prices. The global trend in inflation is putting extra pressure on the United States, and a weakening of the dollar, which appeared evident this week, would aggravate the American inflationary trend. **********Highly sensitive to these risks, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, continues to ''lean against the wind'' of inflation, to use the phrase of a former Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin. But such metaphors or exact statements of policy rarely fall from the lips of the hypercautious Mr. Greenspan. **********In his testimony before a Congressional committee this week, he said inflation pressures, which were troubling the markets, reflected ''forces that have been evolving all along.'' But he contended that the current situation was different from that which confronted the nation in the late 1970's -and is presumably less extreme. When asked whether he foresaw a prime rate in the high teens or 20 percent in the next year or a year and a half, Mr. Greenspan said, ''I can't reply to specific forecasts.'' **********Nevertheless, his belief that the current situation is not nearly so dangerous seemed evident in his remark that the Fed would wait longer to see what the effects would be of the tightening measures it has already taken. He said that those observers who thought that the full effects would not be known for some time were ''of course correct.'' **********Mr. Greenspan's hand has been stayed by growing evidence that the economy is already starting to slow. The first quarter of 1989 is likely to come in as the most robust of the year; gross national product adjusted for inflation may have grown at an annual rate as high as 6 percent, pushed along partly by an upswing in farm inventories. But from here on in, the economy is likely to slow. **********There is virtual unanimity among American economists on slower growth for the rest of the year, although that consensus breaks down on whether the slowdown will eventuate in a recession or not. A majority of economists still foresee sluggish growth rather than an actual recession either this year or next. Signs of slowing are present in declining orders for durable goods, lower housing starts, slower retail sales and scattered evidence of declining profits. **********With pressures on sales increasing and with labor and energy and other raw material costs still rising, a profit squeeze looms. The stock markets' worries this year about inflation and rising interest rates have now been compounded by new worries about profits. **********Obviously the markets - and the White House -would love to have it both ways: a declining rate of inflation and interest rates accompanied by a strong and rising economy. But that marvelous outcome does not appear to be available after the long expansion, the near-capacity levels of output, the budget deficit and the persistent inflationary pressures. How to break out of this bind may simply not have a near-term solution. **********The outlook now is that as real economic growth slows, inflation and interest rates will also level off, and possibly begin to drop, depending on whether the economy falls or not. The Fed is seeking to engineer a smooth landing, and it is conceivable that under the adroit Mr. Greenspan it can do so. **********But shocks could lie ahead, as from a concentration of power by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies. Another oil shock would seriously aggravate the inflationary dangers that troubled the markets early this week. **********However, barring such unforeseen and unforeseeable shocks, the outlook now is for slowing economic growth and a peak in interest rates before 1989 is over."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/29/business/an-electronics-chain-s-sharp-slide.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1989-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Electronics Chain's Sharp Slide", "print_headline": "An Electronics Chain's Sharp Slide", "body_text": " **********Early in this decade the consumer electronics industry was riding high, with sales, spurred by videocassette recorders and microwave ovens, advancing smartly each year. But with increasing competition and a lack of new products, the industry has gone into a slump. Highland Superstores Inc., a Midwest-based chain with sales of nearly $1 billion, has become a symbol of the difficulties now eating away at the profits of these chains. **********Virtually from the moment Highland went public in 1985, the chain, the second-largest electronics merchant in the United States after Circuit City Stores Inc., has struggled to match its performance in the early 80's. Part of Highland's troubles were of its own making: deciding, for instance, to expand heavily into Texas just as that state's economy was heading into a recession. But Highland has also fallen victim to external factors. **********For example, while the wholesale prices Highland pays for television sets, stereos and other electronic merchandise have fallen, competition from other big electronics chains, ranging from Silo in Chicago to Best Buy in Minneapolis to American TV in Milwaukee, has forced Highland to cut its prices, squeezing profit margins. **********Revenues at Highland's well-established stores have been flat or declining - the result of a slowdown in sales of two of the chain's most important products, videocassette recorders and microwave ovens. **********Unable to come up with replacements, Highland has been hurting. Although the company's sales have continued to rise, as a result of the opening of new stores, profits have gone into a tailspin, falling to $7.2 million, or 40 cents a share, last year from a peak of $25.1 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1985. Highland's shares closed at $6 today in over-the-counter trading. The company went public in 1986, and the shares once traded as high as $39.25. **********Now, with Highland expecting to report its first quarterly loss in some time, Wall Street analysts are glum. **********''I just don't see an earnings turnaround in the near term,'' said David A. Bolotsky of Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''They have taken positive steps, but I don't see enough happening to be more positive.'' **********Among other electronics chains that have stumbled are Audio-Video Affiliates of Dayton, Ohio, which is restructuring; the Federated Group of Los Angeles, which sold out to Atari; Crazy Eddie Inc. of Edison, N.J., which has teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and the Best Buy Company, a Minneapolis-based chain with about 40 stores in the Midwest, which suffered losses in recent quarters. **********Circuit City Stores has been an exception. Its continued profits, Wall Street analysts say, are the result of a better-managed operation, one that buys the best-selling items, keeps stores well stocked and advertises even in markets where it is dominant. Stores Remodeled **********Highland, by comparison, provides the clearest example of how market forces have combined to erode the profits of the rest of the industry. And Highland's strategy for recovering -improving customer service, automating to cut costs and remodeling its 84 stores to highlight new devices for home offices - has also been adopted by others. Most of the stores are in the Midwest and Texas, but the chain has recently opened outlets in New England and New York State. **********Highland is ''a microcosm of what is happening in the industry,'' said David Lachenbruch, the editorial director of Television Digest, a New York-based weekly newsletter that specializes in the consumer electronics industry. ''Consumer electronics on the whole in the United States is probably in the red,'' he added. **********It was not always that way, for the industry or for Highland. The company was founded as Highland Appliance in 1933 by Harry Mondry, who opened his first store in the Highland Park section of Detroit. Mr. Mondry prospered after World War II by being among the first to offer, in a no-frills setting, discount prices on everything from dishwashers to disposals. Carrying a broad selection of brand merchandise also spurred sales, and Highland began to expand, growing from one store in 1951 to roughly 18 at the end of the 1970's. **********But it was not until the 1980's that Highland's growth, like that at many other electronics chains, began to accelerate. The increasing use of microwave ovens helped propel such chains. But the real reason for their success was the soaring popularity of videocassette recorders. At one point, sales of VCR's accounted for 25 percent of Highland's business. **********''The development of the VCR was a huge factor for us,'' said Eugene P. Mondry, Highland's 58-year-old chief executive and son of the founder, in an interview. ''It stimulated not only VCR sales but television sales as well.'' **********It also prompted Highland to undertake a further expansion. From 25 stores in 1983, the company grew to 40 stores in 1985 and then to the current 84. With this expansion has come sales growth, to $910.8 million last year from $520.5 million in 1985. **********But at the time Highland was opening its new stores, competition was beginning to squeeze profits and the VCR boom was fizzling. After peaking at 11.8 million units in 1986, sales of VCR's fell to 11.6 million in 1987 and to 10.7 million units last year, according to the Electronics Industry Association. Sales of microwave ovens also fell sharply. **********How Highland fares in coming quarters may well be a measure of the rest of the industry. Mr. Mondry has laid out a three-pronged strategy for a comeback at Highland, working with his 65-year-old brother, David, Highland's chairman; his 35-year-old nephew, Ira, a lawyer who serves as chief operating officer, and his son, Mitchell, 29, an M.B.A. who serves as vice president for customer service.. **********At the heart of the strategy is a belief that Highland must find something to replace the decline in VCR and microwave sales. ''We just don't have a knockout, blockbuster product,'' said Yale Levin, the company's chief financial officer. **********In recent months Mr. Mondry has begun remodeling Highland's stores so that equipment for home offices -ranging from inexpensive facsimile machines and photocopiers to sophisticated telephone-answering machines and personal computers - has been grouped together. Arranging the machines as if they were in a home office, Mr. Mondry is creating entirely new departments in Highland's stores that he calls the Highland Work Station. **********''These are all products sustaining the consumer electronics business and helping it grow,'' Mr. Mondry said. **********Mr. Mondry has also begun to install computer systems to help Highland better manage its inventory and distribution. The goal: to minimize inventory-holding costs while having enough goods on hand to meet the huge demand when a sale is run. **********Meantime, Mr. Mondry has begun placing more product information in Highland's showrooms for customers to read while they wait for sales help. He is positioning information kiosks in the center of Highland stores where customers can have questions answered. And he is adopting more of a self-service approach to merchandising, hauling boxes of his products onto the sales floor so customers do not have to wait for an item to be retrieved from storage. **********The conditions that got Highland into trouble in the first place - lack of a new product and competition -are not likely to disappear. Highland's ''new'' product - equipment for the home office - is in fact one of the fastest-growing segments in specialty-store retailing, with chains like Staples and Office World expanding rapidly. Any advantage Highland has in this area cannot be sustained, industry experts say. **********Not surprisingly, many industry experts think that Highland's best bet may be to focus on the fundamentals that gave the company its start: having the broadest selection of name-brand goods at the lowest possible prices, even if it means not having anything new."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/world/shadowy-terror-group-has-strong-ties-to-iran.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1989-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1084, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shadowy Terror Group Has Strong Ties to Iran", "print_headline": "Shadowy Terror Group Has Strong Ties to Iran", "body_text": " **********''We are headed for dealing with evil at the roots,'' the founding manifesto of the Party of God says, ''and the roots are America.'' **********The Party of God, the shadowy Lebanese Shiite Muslim group at the center of a crisis over Israel's abduction of one of its leaders and the reported hanging of an American marine, is marked by its unyielding religious ideology and its strong ties with Iran. **********The Iranian connection is one of the most important features of the Party of God movement. Its symbol is a blue and blood-red image of the world with an upraised arm holding an automatic rifle surmonted by the Arabic words of a verse from the Koran from which the group takes its name: ''Lo, the party of God, they are victorious.'' That symbol has been increasingly painted on walls in the shantytown slums of Beirut and the hill villages of southern Lebanon as a means of staking out turf. Linked to TWA Hijacking **********''We strive to be in the vanguard of the people that are engaged in holy war for independence and freedom,'' the key political leader of the movement, Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin, said in an interview in June 1985, when gunmen affiliated with the group were holding hostages aboard a hijacked Trans World Airlines jet and had shot and killed one passenger, an American Navy diver. **********''The American state and Government tops the list of the states which acted by all means in killing the people of the area, especially the Islamic people,'' Sheik Amin said in the interview in the Bir Abed district on the southern fringes of Beirut, a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism. He sat next to a large portrait of Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and was guarded by bearded young men with decals of Islamic religious slogans on the stocks of their AK-47 assault rifles. **********Although the Party of God itself has not claimed responsibility for any hostage-taking, specific cells affiliated with the group, like the Revolutionary Justice Organization and the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, have taken hostages. It was the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth that said it carried out the abduction and killing of the American marine, Lieut. Col. William R. Higgins, and it is the Revolutionary Justice Organization that says it holds Joseph J. Cicippio, who has been named as the next hostage to die. **********In the 1985 T.W.A. hijacking, the release of the hostages was delayed for several hours because a group among the kidnappers affiliated with the Party of God refused at first to turn them over. Clashes With Other Shiites **********The Party of God has taken on not only the United States, but also its fellow Shiites of the Amal movement, a more mainstream organization that once laid claim to leadership of Lebanon's Shiite underclass; Syria, once its ally and supplier, whose soldiers sought to impose their own version of law and order in West Beirut, and Israel. Many of the clashes have been bloody; over the last two years the Party of God has fought battles lasting for days in Beirut with both Amal and the Syrians. **********The group, known in Arabic as Hezbollah, first surfaced in the summer of 1982, during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon to oust the Palestine Liberation Organization, when Iran sent about 1,000 of its Revolutionary Guards to the area of Baalbek in the Bekaa region. The area was already the headquarters of Hussein Musawi, who had split from the mainstream Shiite Amal leadership of Nabih Berri to form his own, fundamentalist, Islamic Amal. **********The Revolutionary Guards were one part of an Iranian apparatus in Lebanon, directed for years - until a falling-out with Syria - from the Iranian Embassy in Damascus and ultimately responsible to a government organization in Teheran dedicated to exporting the Islamic Revolution. **********Baalbek came to be a stronghold of Shiite fundamentalism and the probable hideout of several Iranian-linked groups that carried out hijackings, kidnappings of Westerners and suicide truck bombings, including that of the barracks of United States Marine peacekeeping troops and two American Embassy buildings. **********The Party of God is run by a council of 12 men, mostly clergymen, including Sheik Amin, according to the Lebanese magazine Al Shiraa. Prominent among the other key leaders is the Party of God's intellectual influence, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who is usually referred to in Beirut newspapers as an ''Islamic scholar'' and whose works include ''Islam and the Logic of Force.'' **********Although the group is believed to be able to muster as many as 6,000 full-and part-time gunmen in a crisis, its structure is somewhat unclear, in part because of the less formal style of organization prevalent in the Arab world. Further, it appears that many Shiite groups loosely linked with the Party of God may be set up for a single specific action and based on family ties. 'A Very Difficult Picture' **********''Hezbollah is not an organization, but it functions in an organized manner,'' Sheik Amin explained in the interview. ''Every action in life needs a system. I cannot draw a picture on this subject, because it is a very difficult picture to draw.'' **********The Party of God made its formal appearance as a political group in Lebanon in February 1985 with the publication of a 48-page manifesto in ceremonies in the southern Lebanese village of Jibchit, marking the anniversary of the 1984 assassination of Sheik Ragheb Harb, one of the most militant opponents of Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in that period. Sheik Harb was gunned down by men believed to be Israeli operatives as he left a neighbor's house after watching the television news. **********It was from this same village that Sheik Harb's successor, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, another fiery preacher, was abducted in an Israeli helicopter commando raid on Friday. **********Paying tribute to Iran's influence, Sheik Amin said at the 1985 ceremony that the Iranian revolution was a ''vanguard'' that ''laid the foundation of a pan-Islamic state under the wise guidance of the fully qualified Fagih, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.'' Fagih, or supreme religious guide, was the title adopted by the late Iranian leader. **********''We want to see Islam prevail throughout the world,'' the sheik said in the later interview."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/business/what-s-new-in-bowling-a-search-for-new-players-as-leagues-shrink.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Stoffel", "pub_date": "1989-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 461, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Search for New Players as Leagues Shrink", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN BOWLING; A Search for New Players as Leagues Shrink", "body_text": " **********TODAY'S state-of-the-art bowling centers are trying to shake the image of smoke-filled haunts where pot-bellied characters like Ralph Cramden in ''The Honeymooners'' meet to drink some beer and bowl a few frames. **********After all, when bowling season officially gets under way this week, the industry will face a nagging problem. Bowling is still the largest indoor participation sport in America, with 68 million people visiting the lanes at least once in 1987. And at an average cost of $1.60 a game, it is among the cheapest. But the game is losing players from its core. The increase in two-income and single-parent families has caused league play to wane. Since 1980, the pool of league bowlers has shrunk by 25 percent, to 7.2 million players in 1987, according to the American Bowling Congress, an association of men's bowling leagues. **********The $4.5 billion-a-year industry has sought Olympic status for bowling to legitimize it as a sport. Bowling was first an exhibition sport at last year's summer games in Seoul, South Korea. And the industry is pressing for medal status in 1992. **********To appeal to the ubiquitous baby boomers and their children, the industry has resorted to promotional gimmicks, high-tech gadgetry and glitz. Shoes resembling jogging sneakers are replacing the traditional two-toned leather lace-ups. Last year, the Brunswick Corporation, the biggest name in bowling, introduced a line of lighter-weight balls for children in bright colors like yellow, pink and orange rather than drab black. And to attract the young set, the Young American Bowling Alliance, an association of youth leagues, started a national Pee-Wee league in 1987, which now includes more than 13,000 children, ages 3 to 7. **********The alleys are becoming trendier, too. At least 2,000 of the nation's 7,800 bowling centers have received face lifts of some sort since 1985, according to the Bowling Proprietors Association of America, a trade group. Many now feature computerized scoring systems that enable newcomers to bowl without knowing the strange method for adding strikes to spares. New and bigger alleys are replacing smaller old ones. The 200 centers built in the last two years typically have 35 lanes or more rather than the usual 15 to 20. The new glitter has enabled centers to raise their prices and draw bigger crowds. Last year, the nation's alleys pulled in an average $23,000 per lane, not counting revenues from food, up from $17,000 in 1980. That has enabled the industry to keep pace with inflation. And centers ought to do even better if the pace of expansion continues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/16/world/last-soviet-soldiers-leave-afghanistan-after-9-years-15000-dead-and-great-cost.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1989-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAST SOVIET SOLDIERS LEAVE AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9 YEARS, 15,000 DEAD AND GREAT COST", "print_headline": "LAST SOVIET SOLDIERS LEAVE AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9 YEARS, 15,000 DEAD AND GREAT COST", "body_text": " **********The last Soviet soldier came home from Afghanistan this morning, the Soviet Union announced, leaving behind a war that had become a domestic burden and an international embarrassment for Moscow. **********The final Soviet departure came on the day set as a deadline by the Geneva accords last April. It left two heavily armed adversaries, the Kremlin-backed Government of President Najibullah and a fractious but powerful array of Muslim insurgents, backed by the United States and Pakistan, to conclude their civil war on their own. **********Lieut. Gen. Boris V. Gromov, the commander of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan, walked across the steel Friendship Bridge to the border city of Termez, in Uzbekistan, at 11:55 A.M. local time (1:55 A.M., Eastern time), 9 years and 50 days after Soviet troops intervened to support a coup by a Marxist ally.  'Our Stay Ends' **********''There is not a single Soviet soldier or officer left behind me,'' General Gromov told a Soviet television reporter waiting on the bridge. ''Our nine-year stay ends with this.'' **********Today's final departure is the end of a steady process of withdrawal since last spring, when Moscow says, there were 100,300 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. At the height of the Soviet commitment, according to Western intelligence estimates, there were 115,000 troops deployed. **********This morning, as the last armored troop carriers rumbled home across the border, a Soviet newspaper carried the first report of atrocities committed in the war by the nation's military forces.  Massacre and Cover-Up **********The weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta described the killing of a carload of Afghan civilians, including women and children, and the order by a commander to cover it up. **********The article was a foretaste of recriminations expected in the months ahead. **********The war cost the Soviet Union roughly 15,000 lives and undisclosed billions of rubles. It scarred a generation of young people and undermined the cherished image of an invincible Soviet Army. Moscow's involvement in Afghanistan was often compared to the American experience in the Vietnam War, in which more than 58,000 Americans died. **********The Soviet intervention, which received international condemnation, cast a pall over relations with China, the Muslim world and the West. It led to an American trade embargo and a Western boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. **********Western reporters flown to Termez to witness the finale said the ceremony at the border was one of festive relief at the homecoming. Today, there were no obvious second thoughts expressed about the venture. **********''The day that millions of Soviet people have waited for has come,'' General Gromov said to an army rally in Termez, Reuters reported. ''In spite of our sacrifices and losses, we have totally fulfilled our internationalist duty.'' Token of Official Esteem **********The official press agency Tass said the Defense Ministry presented all of the returning soldiers with wristwatches. **********Yet in contrast with the joy at leaving Afghanistan, Soviet press reports told of insurgents massing outside Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other major cities, and of Afghan Army regulars deserting in droves. The reports seemed intended to brace the public for the possibility that defeat would follow retreat. **********Vadim Perfilyev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, described the situation in Kabul today as ''relatively calm'' but said the guerrillas continued to gather reinforcements around the main cities and along the highway to the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Perfilyev said 160 trucks bearing food and fuel reached Kabul safely on Tuesday to relieve shortages in time for an expected siege. He added that aircraft were still ferrying supplies into airports at Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif. A Few Advisers and Guards **********An estimated 250 Soviet civilians were believed to have stayed on at the Soviet Embassy in Kabul after the troops left. Mr. Perfilyev said he did know how many military advisers, ''if any,'' were still in Afghanistan. **********The official who negotiated the Geneva accords, Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, said at the United Nations today that he believed that fewer than 10 Soviet military advisers would remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal, principally as embassy guards. **********Western diplomats and Soviet journalists speculate that the guerrillas will attempt a quick victory, perhaps in the vulnerable eastern city of Jalalabad, to break the Government's morale. This would be accompanied by a slow-death blockade of Kabul. **********But Soviet officials and some recent Western visitors say they believe that Mr. Najibullah's forces may prove sturdier than expected. They control vast arsenals of Soviet-supplied weapons, and are motivated by the fear of rebel reprisals if they lose. **********A Government statement on the troop withdrawal said the responsibility for a blood bath in Afghanistan now would largely rest on the guerrillas' suppliers. Onus for Further Conflict **********''Whether the Afghan situation will develop along the lines of national accord and the creation of a broadly based coalition government,'' the statement said, ''or along the lines of escalating war and tension in and around the country, depends to a large degree on those who have, over all these years, aided and abetted the armed opposition, supplying it with sophisticated weapons.'' **********The Soviet Government renewed its appeal to Pakistan and the United States to join in a cutoff of military aid to the warring parties. The United States, which a year ago was pressing such an arrangement on the reluctant Soviets, now argues that it is too late. **********The rebels insist that they will not take part in a coalition that retains Mr. Najibullah or his Communist political grouping, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. But their own efforts to coalesce have faltered over issues of ideology and power sharing. **********At home, the Soviet Government now faces a period of reckoning with the roots and consequences of the war. **********In Pravda, the authoritative Communist Party newspaper, a commentator insisted today that the intervention was carried out with the best intentions -including maintaining the security of the Soviet Union's southern border. But he said that the war was characterized by the mistakes and misjudgments of previous leaders. **********''One can question the Brezhnev leadership's assessment of the military threat,'' the commentary said. ''One can say that in the future such vital issues as the use of troops must not be decided in secrecy, without the approval of the country's Parliament.'' What Has Been Learned?  Other commentators, who have been constrained while Soviet soldiers were still fighting on Afghan territory, can now be expected to question more pointedly how the Soviet Union got into Afghanistan, what it did there, why it stayed so long and what lessons it has learned. **********The account today in Literaturnaya Gazeta, a dark essay on the corrupting power of the war, was a sample of the gloves-off analysis that is likely to find its way into the press. **********The article, by Gennadi Bocharov, who has written extensively from Afghanistan since 1979, told of Soviet troops firing on a carload of civilians after they refused to stop at a border checkpoint and ignored a warning shot. **********The troops then opened fire on the vehicle, killing a young woman and wounding three others. An old woman and two children were not hurt. **********When the soldiers radioed to their commander to ask for further intructions, he replied according to the account, ''I don't need captives.'' **********The commander, who was identified only as Rudykh, told them to eliminate the evidence. **********''So they did,'' Mr. Bocharov reported. ''The passenger car was smashed by an armored vehicle and buried in the earth.'' **********The commander was reportedly sentenced to six years' imprisonment, but freed almost immediately in an amnesty. History of the Struggle **********The first Soviet troops parachuted into Kabul on Dec. 27, 1979, to assist Babrak Karmal, who had become President in a coup within the Communist leadership. **********The Soviets have always insisted that they came in response to a plea for help from a legitimately constituted Karmal Government. However, most Western analysts say the Soviets engineered the coup as a pretext to replace the Afghan leader who had lost their trust, Hafizullah Amin. **********The next day, four motorized rifle divisions crossed the Amu Darya River on pontoon bridges, and Moscow announced that its ''limited military contingent'' would stay as long as necessary to repel outside aggression. **********This they did for years; along the way, in 1986, Mr. Najibullah, the former chief of the Afghan secret police, replaced mr. Karmal in a purge. **********The Soviet-backed Kabul Government has generally kept a firm grip on the cities, but throughout the war has been unable to rout the rebels in the countryside, where the conservative populace was antagonized at the outset by changes in social and land policies that offended Muslim tradition. **********After 1986, the Soviet Air Force was rendered largely useless by advanced Stinger antiaircraft missiles supplied by the United States to the rebels. Overture From East Bloc **********Peace talks moderated by the United Nations bore little fruit until early last year, when Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Najibullah offered a nine-month withdrawal timetable if Pakistan and the United States agreed to curtail their aid to the guerrillas. **********The arms embargo never materialized, because President Reagan demanded that Moscow stop supplying Mr. Najibullah as part of the bargain, and the Soviets refused. **********In the end, Moscow's withdrawal was in effect unilateral. **********The Geneva accords introduced United Nations observers to watch the troops depart, but the agreements' other painstakingly negotiated provisions, promising an end to all outside intervention in Afghanistan, were generally ignored. **********The Bush Administration has indicated that it plans to continue arming the rebels after the Soviet withdrawal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/24/world/his-life-transformed-rushdie-is-bearing-up.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1989-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1360, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "His Life Transformed, Rushdie Is 'Bearing Up'", "print_headline": "His Life Transformed, Rushdie Is 'Bearing Up'", "body_text": " **********As the full implications of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence on the British author Salman Rushdie sink in, his friends here are saying that whatever happens to him in the future, he will never be able to go back to the highly active and visible life he was leading until last week. **********His novel ''The Satanic Verses,'' denounced by the Ayatollah and by Muslims in India, Pakistan, Britain and elsewhere as a blasphemous insult to the Islamic faith and to the Prophet Mohammed, seems a fateful book to many of the author's friends. They find in it passages that seem to presage later tragedies, including the author's own, and irony that two British institutions harshly treated in the book -Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the London police - are now responsible for protecting his life. **********So closely held are the security precautions taken since the London police put him under protection last week that only his sister, his literary agent and a few close friends know exactly where he is or have spoken with him since he disappeared, though they confirm that he is still in this country. His home in Islington is closed. **********''He is well,'' said one friend, the writer Tariq Ali. ''He is bearing up well, he is in relatively good spirits, and is very gratified at all the support that he has received, and he is also very aware that there are many, many devout Muslims all over the world who do not agree with Khomeini.'' **********Mr. Rushdie ''does not feel under great strain or pressure,'' Mr. Ali said, ''but it is going to be very difficult for him now. He will be constantly haunted by the spectre of death.'' **********''The security is out of his hands, I think,'' Mr. Ali continued. ''The people who are looking after him will have to decide how long he must remain under protection. My own feeling is that the stakes are constantly being upped, now that the clerics in Iran have united to call for his death.'' **********Another friend, Dr. Alastair N. R. Niven, literary director of the Arts Council of Great Britain, said: ''I haven't spoken with him since he's gone to ground. All I know is that on Monday his sister said that he is extremely well-protected.'' **********''I have absolutely no idea how one copes with something like this,'' he said. ''I presume he will have to move from his old address. He will have to find some way to continue his life, if he's permitted to do so, but I can't imagine him returning to the kind of gregarious existence he led up until last week.'' **********Mr. Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, has been in touch with him but would not comment on his contacts. Viking, the publisher of ''The Satanic Verses,'' will not say whether it has or has not been in contact with the author, a spokesman said. Harper & Row, the publisher for Mr. Rushdie's wife, the American writer Marianne Wiggins, said this week that she would remain in seclusion with her husband. **********Mr. Rushdie mailed a review of Philip Roth's book ''The Facts'' that arrived at the offices of the Sunday newspaper The Observer today and called the journal's literary editor, Blake Morrison. **********''He did not sound terminally depressed or anything,'' Mr. Morrison told Press Association, a British news agency. Mr. Rushdie told him the way Mr. Roth had coped with his own ordeal after ''Portnoy's Complaint'' aroused anger among Jews in the United States in 1967 had been a comfort to him, Mr. Morrison said. **********But one of Mr. Rushdie's former publishers said: ''It's an incredibly gloomy prospect for Salman. He was pretty defiant in the first days after the death sentence, but it must only be sinking in now. The general view in the publishing world here is that he is a marked man for life, and will need either protection or some form of complete seclusion or isolation. I suppose he could have plastic surgery and go live in Uruguay, but that for him would be the end of life as he knows it.'' **********''But his life as he has known it is over,'' concluded this man, who asked that he and his publishing house not be identified, for fear of attracting the same kind of unwanted attention. **********Viking spokesmen said they could not comment at all. **********Viking, part of the Penguin Group, bought the world English-language rights to the book for $850,000 at auction last spring. Representatives of two other publishing houses involved in the bidding at various points, Random House and William Collins, said they had had no idea of the trouble the book would cause in Muslim countries or here after it was published. **********''I don't think anybody could have read the book with any attention and not realize that the character of Mahound in the book was the Prophet Mohammed,'' said one of them. But even so, as Simon King, an editor at Collins, said, ''I don't think any U.K. editor could ever have thought, sitting at home with the book on a weekend, that anyone would ever want to burn this book or wish to kill the author.'' Thatcher Denounces Threat **********Mrs. Thatcher has denounced incitement to kill the author and on Monday ordered her Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to call back all five members of the British diplomatic mission in Teheran. But officials at 10 Downing Street said the police had made their own decision to take Mr. Rushdie under protection after the Ayatollah's call for his killing. ''Their job is to protect British subjects,'' one of them said, ''and Mr. Rushdie has done nothing wrong.'' **********How long the British police will think it necessary to maintain extensive security arrangements for Mr. Rushdie, or whether he could afford to pay for private guards if the Government cuts them off or he decides to live in some other country, are unknown. **********But James Adams, an expert on terrorism, said British intelligence believed that the main danger - from a lone fanatic - would subside in intensity if Iranian leaders stopped repeating the call for Mr. Rushdie's death. ''There is no evidence that Iranian death squads or terrorists are being sent from the Middle East to Britain, or of any extra activity by groups in this country,'' he said. **********One of Mr. Rushdie's publishers noted that the London police and the British immigration authorities come in for a hard time in Mr. Rushdie's novel, which portrays them as heavy-handed and racist. Eerie Parallels With Book **********There are other eerie coincidences between fictional events in the book, published here last Sept. 26, and things that actually happened later. A character in the book named Salman, taking dictation of the Koran from the Prophet, deliberately changes some words, and Mahound pronounces a death sentence on him, saying: ''Your blasphemy, Salman, can't be forgiven. Did you think I wouldn't work it out? To set your words against the Words of God.'' **********The opening scene in the book finds the two principal characters, Gibreel and Saladin, tumbling through the sky over England after a terrorist explosion blows up their airliner in mid-air, as happened to Pan American World Airways flight 103 from London over the tiny Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21. In the book, Saladin drives through Lockerbie looking for Gibreel. The two of them survived their disaster; everyone on the Pan Am plane died. **********''It does seem to be a fated book,'' one of Mr. Rushdie's friends said, noting hopefully that the Salman character in it is finally reprieved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/business/slow-talks-by-andersen-waterhouse.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1989-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Slow Talks By Andersen, Waterhouse", "print_headline": "Slow Talks By Andersen, Waterhouse", "body_text": " **********Arthur Andersen & Company and Price Waterhouse, the two large accounting firms that had hoped to reach a merger agreement by early this month, are expected to announce shortly that they will need additional time for discussions, several people in the industry said. **********On July 6, the two accounting firms disclosed that they had entered into 60 days of formal talks. The agreement, however, appears to have been signed two days earlier. **********''Sixty days was quite ambitious,'' said Stewart Kohn, an Andersen partner who quit recently to start his own litigation support practice, Kohn Consulting Inc. ''They're not necessarily ready to agree, nor are they necessarily ready to call the party off yet.'' **********In a small, but perhaps telling, example of the larger issues that still divide them, the two sides do not even agree on when the self-imposed deadline officially expired. And the longer the uncertainty lingers, the more morale could suffer. Then, too, further delays could cause logistical headaches, like how the two firms will market themselves - as adversaries or future partners - to potential recruits on campuses this fall. **********Some people, however, find the caution understandable in light of the trouble that two competitors, Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young & Company, are having consummating their merger because of problems with their affiliates abroad. Last month, a large Ernst affiliate, Thorne Ernst & Whinney, Canada's largest accounting firm, said it would defect to KPMG Peat Marwick rather than join Ernst & Young. The Ernst & Young merger is also believed to be facing opposition in Japan from the Ministry of Finance. **********The merger of Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse is also ''not just a U.S. issue, and that may be one of the reasons for the slowness of the decision,'' said Joel Portugal, a principal in Anspach, Grossman & Portugal, a corporate identity consultant who has worked for both Andersen and Price Waterhouse. 'Bunch of Different Fiefdoms' **********''When you're dealing with an accounting firm, as opposed to a corporation, you've got a whole bunch of different fiefdoms,'' he said. ''That very well could be one reason why this thing is not going as fast as they promised.'' **********In addition to the international units of the two accounting firms that will have some say in this deal, one ''fiefdom'' that will be especially tough to conquer, many people believe, will be Andersen Consulting, a separate unit created earlier this year to appease the big producers in Andersen's consulting practice. **********Performance bonuses were created with the expectation that the consultants would benefit the most. And for the first time, consulting partners were guaranteed that their seats on Andersen's powerful 24-member board would be in keeping with their representation among the partners. **********Not only is a merger with Price Waterhouse likely to dilute the consultants' voice in governance because there will be a lower percentage of consultants in the combined firm, but it could also compound some of the competitive problems the consultants already face as part of an accounting organization. Andersen Consulting's Specialty **********Taking large computer projects from start to finish has emerged as Andersen Consulting's specialty. The firm typically bids on such ''systems integration'' work, as it is known, under a joint venture or subcontractor agreement with a computer manufacturer like the International Business Machines Corporation or the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, bars accounting firms from having certain shared business interests with companies whose books it also audits, on the theory that such ties taint an auditor's independence. **********The problem arises because Andersen Consulting has frequent dealings with I.B.M., as does Price Waterhouse as the computer maker's auditor and tax adviser, and neither firm would want to lose the business. 'Very Important Relationship' **********''We have a vast number of varying relationships with I.B.M.,'' said George T. Shaheen, the head of Andersen Consulting. ''It's a very important relationship.'' He declined to address how a merger might shake out, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two firms. **********The conflict cuts so deeply that there were reports circulating last week that I.B.M. was interested in making an offer for part or all of Andersen Consulting. I.B.M. has recently taken equity stakes in two other systems integrators, Computer Task Group Inc. and American Management Systems Inc. **********But ''there's nothing imminent,'' said an I.B.M. spokesman, Peter Thonis. **********Mr. Shaheen called the reports ''rubbish.'' **********He cited the ''agonizing'' period of introspection at Andersen that culminated in the reorganization of the consulting group in January, and the advantage to Andersen and I.B.M. of maintaining some distance rather than becoming a captive of any one manufacturer. **********''For us to go out on the streets with an I.B.M. banner, how would we serve our clients interested in D.E.C. or any one else?'' he asked. ''For us to align with any one of them wouldn't be in our interests or theirs.'' Less Bargaining Power **********The consulting partners at Andersen also appear to have less bargaining power in trying to shape the merger than previously thought. As part of the ''January accord,'' all of Andersen's partners, including the consultants, agreed to refrain temporarily from competing with Andersen upon leaving the firm. **********Partners had until Friday, the first day of Andersen's new fiscal year, to approve or reject the revised partnership documents. And while Andersen said it did not yet know the outcome of the vote, it is unlikely that the proposed amendments were defeated after the blueprint upon which they were based was approved overwhelmingly in January. **********Such agreements not to compete would make it harder for any Andersen consultant who might be disenfranchised by the Price Waterhouse merger to threaten to leave with valuable clients or personnel in tow. **********Indeed, several Andersen partners who were troubled by the provision, as was Mr. Kohn, have left recently to beat the deadline. Other Merger Headaches **********The two firms face other merger headaches as well. For example, they need to mesh their retirement plans. **********And, not least, they must settle on a new name for the combined firm. **********''To walk away from either of those heritages and images, you almost have to be insane,'' said Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott & Margulies Inc., an identity consultant. **********In observing the situation, he suggested that the firms start fresh with a new name backed by heavy advertising. ''It's a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime opportunity to say something very dramatic and new because they're not going to do this ever again,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/17/business/savings-units-might-get-fed-loans.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1989-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Savings Units Might Get Fed Loans", "print_headline": "Savings Units Might Get Fed Loans", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank system is facing a growing cash squeeze that is likely to require emergency lending soon by the Federal Reserve. **********This cash squeeze, partly a result of increased withdrawals from savings units in the Southwest, is reflected in the alarming jump in interest rates offered this week by a few deeply troubled savings institutions in the Houston area. **********Regulators in Washington met during the last two days to clarify terms under which the regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve system would provide funds to cash-short institutions, officials familiar with the talks said. **********Spokesmen for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Reserve declined to comment on reports in the industry that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman, were working out details of how sick savings units could borrow directly from the regional Fed banks. No Details Provided **********George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, said he was unable to provide details of meetings among regulators in Washington, but he said, ''The indication I have is there is Federal Reserve involvement.'' **********Earlier this week, L. William Seidman, the regulator appointed by President Bush to coordinate the rescue program, told reporters in Dallas that he was taking a close look at possible financing problems in the region. **********''We and the Home Loan banks and the Fed have plans for liquidity problems that arise, and they have not arisen,'' said Mr. Seidman, who is chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''But we do have plans.'' **********Industry executives in Texas said the main issue in the talks was the source and form of collateral Mr. Greenspan would require from the Home Loan system that Federal Reserve banks needed as pledges against new loans. **********One possible solution, they said, was promissory notes issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits in savings and loans, that could be repaid with cash after Congress approves some form of rescue for the industry. **********Last week, President Bush endorsed a plan calling for what the Administration described as $90 billion in aid over 10 years, but which actually amounts to at least $126 billion. The President asked Congress to approve the plan in 45 days, a deadline Congress is not expected to meet. Strains Will Persist **********Several executives in Texas said the financing strains appearing in the savings industry would persist until Congress approves some form of financial relief. ''Nobody can do anything until Congress gives them some money,'' said Gerald Hartman, president of the Colonial Savings and Loan Association, a healthy institution in Fort Worth. **********Mr. Barclay, who heads one of 12 regional banks, said depositors in the Southwest had withdrawn funds from savings units at a faster pace than normal since Mr. Bush announced his rescue plan on Feb. 6. **********The Dallas bank responded by stepping up loans to savings institutions in the region, pushing its total loans to $23 billion, compared with $10 billion at the end of June. **********Institutions are typically required to pledge good loans or other assets when they borrow from the Dallas bank, but Mr. Barclay said many were approaching the limits of their reserves of healthy collateral. **********That was the case, he said, with two insolvent institutions in the Houston area, Commonwealth Savings and Bancplus. Earlier this week, they offered to pay more than a full percentage point above the average rates in Dallas and Houston on six-month brokered certificates of deposit. 'We Achieved Our Target' **********David Webster, a spokesman for Commonwealth, said his institution decided this afternoon to withdraw from the market for ''jumbo certificates,'' which include deposits greater than $100,000. Commonwealth, which offered 10.75 percent for the last three days, was not under pressure from regulators to cut the rate, he said. ''We achieved our targets,'' he explained. **********Still, Commonwealth's current rate for insured retail deposits of $100,000 or less remains among the highest in Texas, at 9.5 percent. The institution has $1.7 billion in assets and a negative net worth of $515 million. **********For its part, Bancplus pared its rate for jumbo C.D.'s to 10.4 percent today from 10.65 percent the last two days. Brendan P. Duffey, Bancplus president, said his institution typically raises large sums from deposit brokers for a few days after the 15th of each month to cover overdue mortgage payments by homeowners. Bancplus services $12 billion in mortgages. **********Paul M. Horvitz, a finance professor at the University of Houston, said regulators often prefer that institutions pay slightly higher rates for brokered funds than advertised for local deposits because it is a more discreet way of managing fund shortages. Avoiding a Cash Crisis **********But the Dallas bank has no intention of permitting a cash crisis at any institution, even if it means advancing money to institutions with no collateral available, Mr. Barclay said. ''We will not allow institutions to run out of liquidity, period,'' he said. **********He said that the Dallas bank had nearly $1.2 billion in F.S.L.I.C. notes available to support new loans, and that additional support could be tapped at the other 11 regional Home Loan banks. The Dallas bank has $3.7 billion in reserves. **********Over all, institutions in Houston and Dallas were paying among the highest rates Tuesday for brokered C.D.'s available through savings units in 10 major cities, averaging about 9.1 percent, according to the Bank Rate Monitor. Only savings units in Boston and Detroit were paying higher average rates. at 9.26 percent.  F.D.I.C. Fraud Squad **********WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (AP) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today that it had created a special mobile fraud squad to conduct investigations at savings and loan institutions. **********The agency, which insures deposits at commercial banks, last week began taking control of more than 200 insolvent savings units under orders from President Bush. **********''Our new fraud squad will be dispatched to the scene whenever our on-site teams discover evidence of fraud or insider abuse,'' said L. William Seidman, F.D.I.C. chairman, in a speech prepared for delivery to a group of accountants in Minneapolis. **********James Dudine, a section chief in the agency's division of bank supervision, will dispatch fraud teams selected from 80 specially trained bank examiners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/28/business/has-realty-giant-grown-too-large.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Has Realty Giant Grown Too Large?", "print_headline": "Has Realty Giant Grown Too Large?", "body_text": " **********Until recently, the Chicago-based JMB Realty Corporation could do no wrong in the eyes of institutional and individual investors. But now, some people are wondering if the real estate giant has expanded too aggressively at a time of uncertainty in the national real estate market. **********While scores of other real estate partnership companies and developers are struggling to survive the effects of overbuilding, tax code changes and the many poor investments that they helped to create, JMB has prospered through shrewd expansion. **********This has made the closely held private company one of the largest real estate concerns in North America, based on the $22 billion worth of property under its management. Started With $5,000 **********JMB is run by Neil G. Bluhm and Judd D. Malkin, two of the men who started it in 1969 with $5,000. Robert Judelson, the third partner, left the firm in 1973. Mr. Bluhm fills the roles of president and chief deal maker, while Mr. Malkin, as chairman, handles the daily management chores. They started out selling real estate investment partnerships as tax shelters, and have grown through acquisitions into a developer and retailer, as well as property owner. **********Now, with multibillion-dollar bids on the table for Bloomingdale's and the Hilton Hotels Corporation, JMB is looking to get much bigger, prompting concern on Wall Street and from investors that the company's growing empire could become increasingly difficult to manage. **********''They have a huge asset base at this point,'' said the head of a major New York development company who asked not to be identified. ''How can you control the risk that comes with that and create value? At some point and size you will see a law of diminishing managerial effectiveness take effect.'' Potentially Risky Areas **********The Bloomingdale's and Hilton bids come at a time when troubled real estate markets are hurting major banks, many retailers are stumbling from mismanagement or excessive debt and other well-known property syndicators are already on the ropes or in bankruptcy court. That has some investors worried that JMB might be branching out into too many potentially risky areas. **********JMB's offers in closed biddings for a probable combined total of around $5.3 billion for the hotel operator and the department store chain, which has been put up for sale by Canada's troubled Campeau Corporation, surprised even some of the company's business partners, who did not expect JMB to pursue both. **********One Wall Street banker said that the company should not have bid for both companies at once. **********''If the marketplace begins to think that they're trying to buy the world, it could damage their amazing investor following,'' he said. **********JMB has enjoyed one of the strongest institutional followings of any privately held company, allowing it to offer billions for companies knowing it can raise the money. Pension Fund Investors **********In some instances the company has even used its own bank credit lines to close a deal and then repaid those loans with money it later raised from investors like the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, the Ford Foundation, and a host of corporate pension funds including those of the Xerox Corporation, CBS Inc. and the General Motors Corporation. **********Mr. Bluhm dismissed the criticisms of too-rapid expansion by saying the company is actually buying at a slower pace than it was two years ago. He added that despite the size of its holdings, JMB, with 4,500 employees, is not getting inefficient simply because it is getting larger. But not all are convinced. **********''If they continue their purchasing bent,'' said James Smith, the real estate investment officer for the California Public Employees Retirement System, ''they certainly will have to answer the question of whether they have sufficient staff to handle the business.'' **********But Mr. Bluhm says there is little reason for such concern. ''From our perspective, we would never take anything on unless we had the manpower to watch it and manage it properly,'' he said. ''I don't like to think in terms of being big but in terms of being the best.'' No Sign of Hesitation **********Whether they like to think in terms of bigness or not, Mr. Bluhm and Mr. Malkin, who each own a third of the company, with the employees owning the balance, preside over a portfolio that is already huge and with no sign that they are hesitant to make it even more enormous. Of the estimated $22 billion worth of property under its management, JMB owns 30 percent, more than $6 billion, for its own account. **********The rest of the portfolio is managed for thousands of institutional and retail clients, according to Mr. Bluhm. That translates into 174 retail properties totaling some 98 million square feet of space; 182 office towers and industrial centers representing 72 million square feet; 71 apartment complexes that have more thanr 22,000 units; 17 hotels with more than 8,000 rooms, and more than 60,000 acres of raw land, mostly in Hawaii. **********Adding Bloomingdale's and Hilton Hotels would mean adding millions more square feet of retail space and thousands of additional hotel rooms. Few doubt that JMB can raise the money to buy all that, but some Wall Street players are questioning the wisdom of the move. **********Despite such worries by outsiders, JMB has perhaps the best argument in its favor: a nearly unblemished track record despite its size. **********''So far they've made no major mistakes and they have a great ability to get deals done,'' said Thomas Lavin, managing director in charge of real estate for the First Boston Corporation. ''A lot of people who were in the syndication business, like Balcor, VMS Realty and Integrated Resources have either gone down the tubes or are now in trouble,'' he added. Providing Its Own Financing **********That sentiment is widespread in real estate circles and proved by JMB's ability to raise billions of dollars to finance deals without the help of Wall Street bankers. Like Olympia & York Developments Ltd. a giant Canadian real estate developer, JMB is a financing company of no small measure. **********For example, in its 1987 acquisition of the Cadillac Fairview Corporation, a large Canadian developer of shopping malls and office towers, JMB raised about $1.4 billion by going directly to pension funds and other institutional investors and convincing them to become equity partners in the deal. The company contributed about $100 million of its own money and most of the remaining cost was raised through bank debt. **********''I think about JMB as being the K.K.R. of the real estate industry,'' said a leading investment banker, referring to the leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, ''with the difference being that K.K.R. are financial overseers, while Bluhm actually manages the business.'' High Return on Partnerships **********According to Furhman Nettles, vice president of Stanger & Company, a New Jersey-based real estate research firm, the returns on JMB's real estate partnerships, its old line of business, have been consistently superior to almost all other real estate syndicators. Return on partnerships are calculated by the payout to partners as well as the appreciation of the value of the properties they hold. **********According to Stanger's assessment, JMB has an average annual pretax return on all its partnerships through 1986 of 13.2 percent. Because it usually takes several years before partnerships begin to show returns, Stanger & Company had no figures for those established after 1986. **********''That's a damn good return,'' Mr. Nettles emphasized. ''The average for the whole industry is 6.7 percent.'' **********In 1983, JMB began a major diversification and expansion. Today, the company, through its affiliate, the JMB Institutional Realty Corporation, is one of the country's major players in the pension advisory business, putting hundreds of millions of dollars of pension fund money annually into prime properties. The company has also become a major developer, with major projects being planned or under way in every major metropolitan market. Large Deals Since 1983 **********Among JMB's largest deals since 1983 have been the purchase of the Urban Investment and Development Company from the Aetna Life and Casualty Company for $1 billion in 1984; the purchase of some real estate assets of the Aluminum Company of America in 1986 for $600 million; the $4.1 billion purchase of Cadillac Fairview in 1987; the purchase of the Walt Disney Company's Arvida unit, a major developer of planned communities in Florida, for $400 million in 1987, and the 1988 purchase for $920 million of Amfac Inc., a wholesale distributor, food retailer and hotel operator. **********This year the company bought a British real estate company, Randsworth Trust P.L.C., for $800 million including refinanced debt, and the Panhandle Eastern Corporation's mixed-use Houston Center development for $400 million. **********Mr. Bluhm said the secret of JMB's success was simple: The company seeks out the best people it can find in a particular business and then offers them a financial interest. Another key is JMB's strategy of buying whole companies and keeping the seasoned management that comes with them. Long-Term Outlook **********''We always try to buy the highest quality assets that are hard to replace, recognizing that we are long-term holders,'' he added. ''When you buy premium assets, over time you do much better. Second, we pay a lot of attention to supply and demand. We try to buy the best properties in areas where there is an impediment to development.'' **********In addition, Mr. Bluhm said, the company never employs excessive leverage and always makes its analyses and decisions based on the worst that can happen. **********''The key is watching yourself on the downside,'' he said. ''If things work out great, fine. But we try to be ready for the worst.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/29/world/us-and-japanese-agree-to-proceed-on-fighter-plane.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1989-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AND JAPANESE AGREE TO PROCEED ON FIGHTER PLANE", "print_headline": "U.S. AND JAPANESE AGREE TO PROCEED ON FIGHTER PLANE", "body_text": " **********President Bush announced today that the United States intends to proceed with a $7 billion project with Japan to produce a new jet fighter, declaring that prolonged negotiations had yielded an agreement ''in the strategic and commercial interests of the United States.'' **********Mr. Bush said the arrangement, which follows months of delicate negotiations with Japan, would safeguard sensitive computer software and that American companies would be guaranteed roughly 40 percent of the production work on the new jet fighter. The new jet, an advanced version of the F-16, is known as the FSX, for fighter support experimental.  Part of Takeshita Plan **********In Tokyo, Japanese officials said the agreement was a reflection of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's determination to settle several difficult problems before leaving office.  [ Page 5. ] **********Bush Administration officials said they were confident that the next Government in Tokyo would abide by the agreement. **********With the announcement, the White House is now bracing for a strong Congressional fight. Once Congress formally receives the agreement, it will have 30 days to reject it. Should that occur, President Bush is certain to veto such a bill, and Congress would need a two-thirds majority in each chamber to override the veto.  Symbolizes New Concern **********The fight over the FSX, a milestone in relations between the United States and Japan, symbolized Washington's new concern over the economic dimension of national security. Under pressure from Congress, the Administration was compelled to expand the definition of national security to include trade and economic objectives, as well as military and strategic concerns. **********The agreement comes after a prolonged inter-agency debate within the Bush Administration, and the President's own uncertainty, which delayed the final decision for weeks. **********Congressional critics of the deal - in which a Japanese company would be the prime contractor - said it was a giveaway of American technology that would help the Japanese build a major aeronautics industry, as they have built highly competitive auto, television and computer chip industries. The opponents include both liberal and conservative lawmakers. **********Supporters said joint production would not only keep Japan from building an aircraft of its own, but would also provide the United States with access to Japanese technology. **********Mr. Bush, in his statement, sought to placate Congressional opponents, saying the deal was in American strategic and economic interests. **********The announcement ends a prolonged argument in the Administration. On one side, the Commerce Department and the Trade Representative argued that the Japanese, with a $55 billion trade surplus with the United States, should be buying military aircraft directly from the United States. **********Moreover, they maintained, the United States should not be assisting the Japanese in developing a potentially competing industry. On the other hand, the State and Defense Departments countered that the deal was in American security interests and argued strongly in favor of it. **********At issue was concern that the United States was giving away too much technology, without reciprocal benefits. Beyond this, critics said the United States was not receiving a fair share of the production and jobs of the estimated 120 planes that would be built. Bush Statement **********''I am pleased to announce that the Governments of the United States and Japan have reached understandings that will allow us to proceed with joint development of the FSX fighter aircraft,'' said Mr. Bush, reading a statement in the White House press room. **********''The U.S. will have a 40 percent work share in the initial development stage of this aircraft and will have a similar share when the aircraft goes into production,'' he said. **********Acknowledging that ''we did have several initial concerns about the agreement,'' Mr. Bush said: ''I want to assure you that sensitive source code's for the aircraft's computer will be strictly controlled. Access will be granted to only those codes that are essential to the project.'' **********''I'm convinced that the co-development of this aircraft is in the strategic and commercial interests of the United States,'' Mr. Bush said. He added that the Administration, which has been divided until recent weeks, ''weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of our industrial growth and technology transfer, as well as strategic and foreign policy considerations.'' **********''I believe this aircraft will improve the defense of the United States and Japan,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And this agreement also helps preserve our commitment that U.S. aerospace products of the future will continue to dominate the world markets.'' Plan Authorized by Reagan **********The FSX plan, which was authorized by the Reagan Administration, called for the General Dynamics Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. to develop a fighter based on an improved design of the American F-16. Initially, the Japanese had sought to develop the FSX independently as a successor to a Mitsubishi fighter called the F-1. But Caspar W. Weinberger, then the Defense Secretary, pressed for a co-development deal, and the disagreement among the Cabinet departments ensued. **********With the agreement today, White House officials said, the Administration was hopeful that the concerns within the Congress and the Government itself would be met. But some lawmakers criticized the deal. **********''I still think it's a bad deal for the United States,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who heads a special House task force on the FSX. Mr. Gephardt said he expected a quick vote in the House, perhaps as early as next week, to try to block the deal. 'It Will Be a Bruising Fight' **********''I think it will be a bruising fight,'' he said. ''I think we will have bipartisan support in both houses. I think we will have a majority, but two-thirds is a much tougher question.'' A two-thirds vote is necessary to override a veto. **********Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said through a spokesman that he thinks this is a better agreement than the one the two Governments negotiated last November. But he said he was ''disturbed'' that the Japanese are not buying planes from the United States. He has not decided how he will vote. **********''What we are giving the Japanese is something they greatly lack - the ability to learn aircraft systems integration,'' said another opponent, Senator Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois. ''We in turn are to receive Japanese composite wing technology, which they have not even produced and which many of our leading aircraft companies already have.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/business/a-week-on-the-beat-of-the-dollar.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1989-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2722, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Week On the Beat Of the Dollar", "print_headline": "A Week On the Beat Of the Dollar", "body_text": " **********THE dealing room at Chase Manhattan Bank is open and noisy. As I began my first day as a trader, I quickly discovered that when the dollar is moving rapidly, the rhythm in the room echoes the movement in the market. But it took precious time to learn the beat. **********The dominant sound was of prices - 70-80, 40-50 - coming from dealers and brokers through the squawk boxes. They only call out the bid, which is the price to buy dollars, and the offer, which is the price to sell. The brokers drop the 138 or 1.93 that would precede the yen or the mark price. Paid, paid, paid, is heard when the dollar is bought and rising; given, given, given when the dollar is sold and falling. **********For one week, I experienced firsthand the anxiety and exhilaration of working as a trader in the $400 billion, 24-hour foreign exchange market. I made money, buying on dips after the Federal Reserve intervened to sell dollars. I took my share of losses when I misread the market. And I experienced the agony of an ''overnight'' when I went home with $10 million on the line while trading continued thousands of miles away. Being a trader is easier than it seems, but harder than it looks. **********As the currency markets have expanded, and corporations have become global, trading has become a split-second game where a day's profit or loss - often reaching $500,000 - can be made in minutes. The traders, generally young, often have a horizon of several hours, sometimes several minutes or less. They sometimes act on little or no information and read only headlines. Brash when they are right, these young traders gleefully face down central banks and policy makers in the United States and its chief industrial allies. **********The traders I worked with are not the big names, but are those who toil in the trenches. For them, an annual salary and bonus can reach $200,000. Skill is important, but so is luck, especially on hectic days that can turn against you while you are getting your coffee of having your shoes shined. **********''None of us are superstars,'' said John Lidyard, 27, a trader from Britain now working here. ''If I was a superstar, I'd be in a Chicago pit doing it myself and putting my own money up.'' **********My boss at Chase was Jack A. Kessler, the senior vice president for foreign exchange. I was given normal restrictions on my trading authority, limiting me to an exposure of $50 million during the day and $25 million overnight. My loss limit was $250,000. ''If you're down $250,000, we talk,'' said Mr. Kessler. **********To trade, I used prices that came from the brokers over the squawk boxes or asked market makers at Chase. My trades would not be executed under a prior arrangement. But I kept track of them as other dealers in the room did and operated in the same market and with the same choice of prices. **********Mr. Kessler, 40, a 19-year year Chase veteran who has traded here and in Europe, said the most important thing I had to learn was the discipline to stay with a position - even it it turned against me - if I expected the dollar to turn around. **********But at the same time, I had to have the discipline to accept a loss. ''Don't think the market is wrong and you are right,'' he said. ''Never marry a position. You can sleep with it a few nights but never marry it.''  A Sense of Speed **********I prepared for the trading room with an intensive three-day session conducted by ACF Consultants Ltd., who use a computer simulation called Global Trader that compresses trading days into 25 minutes. You get an immediate sense of the speed of the market and the difficulty of reaching your goals. I learned quickly what it was like to be just one step behind the market, and losing as I wearily tried to keep up. **********So, when I got to the Chase trading room at 7 A.M. Monday on a hot August day, I was ready to go. But it took me more than 45 minutes to put my toe in the market. **********The bids and offers were just noise. I had no idea where the dollar was going and was only reassured when some traders said they were in the same boat. If I thought the dollar would fall, I would want to go short, or sell, dollars. If I thought the dollar would rise, I'd do the opposite and go long, or buy. **********My first trade was not auspicious. But I did it. Ryosuke Tsuji, 32, the head yen dealer and one of the growing number of Japanese traders here, gave me a price and I sold $5 million against the yen at 139.76. It was official, and I put it on my trader's position blotter.  At first, as the dollar fell a little, it looked like the right move. But an hour later, while I was chatting with Mr. Lidyard of Chase, the dollar rose. My ears, however, were not yet attuned to the room and I did not hear the dollar go up against the yen. By the time I had bought the $5 million back at 139.77, I had lost $357.73 or one pip - the basic unit that measures profit or loss on a trade. **********On this first day (and again on Tuesday and Wednesday), the market for both the mark and the yen drifted up and down in search of a direction. There was no major economic news or event to give it a one-way impetus. ''This type of market is not good for our style of trading'' at Chase, said John Gaines, 45, the chief dealer and one of the oldest in the room. **********So what a trader does is look for something to give him a clue. One crutch is the chart, which plots the course of the dollar and shows if it is likely to move up or down. Technical analysts do this regularly and the market is paying more attention to them. When the dollar nears a critical chart point, it often bounces off, then, like a battering ram on a door, takes another run until it finally breaks through or gives up. **********Another aid is information from customers who buy or sell dollars through the bank or from traders at other banks who know of large dollar buys and sells. You can, if you have a customer selling a lot of dollars, ''jump on the back'' and ride by following his sale with your own. **********But this is also hit and miss. Anthony Scamardella, 32, the head mark trader, said that a very saavy Japanese customer had sold dollars Monday morning and was buying dollars in the afternoon. But the usually reliable customer was wrong in the morning. Should he follow him again? Anthony asked John M. Donnelly, 24, a mark trader. He did. This time the customer was right. **********On Monday, after my one-pip loss, I improved. On my first mark trade, of $5 million, I made a profit of 16 pips or $4,193. As the market continued to move up and down that day, I spent a lot of energy cutting losing positions and quickly reversing them in the hope of recouping the losses. This defensive money-making is called digging out. **********I did this because I was bullied by the market; I was unwilling to hold a position for too long. There is a lot of pressure as the dollar is rising against you and the numbers are shouted - 75, 80, 90, 95. I found that a nifty trick one hour can swamp you the next. **********It wasn't long before I wiped out my Monday early profit. I did this by selling $5 million against the mark. But the dollar began to rise, which meant I was losing money. I then bought $10 million against the mark, hoping to make up for my loss. But, the dollar turned again and fell. **********So I took my first bold move and sold $25 million against the mark as the dollar fell more. This one transaction took me out of the long dollar position and increased the size of the new short dollar position, so a small move in my favor could wipe out my previous losses. It was a big risk and if I was wrong I would lose even more. **********Then I waited. That's the worst, the waiting. Its futile to root for the market to go your way, but I did. But the brokers' calls were understandable now. I could distinguish between the mark and the yen and the repetitions gave me a feel for the market. It was like beginning to understand a new language. **********The dollar slipped lower against the mark from the 1.9070 I had sold at and was near 1.9030, which put me ahead. But the dollar didn't move lower - this was a chart point - and climbed higher. I waited. Sometimes it takes several tries to move through such a level. But no, not then. So I quickly bought $25 million at 1.9055, making close to $20,000. **********After lunch - two bananas - I did well again. I felt the dollar would fall just because of the way it had been bouncing about; so I sold $15 million against the mark and then bought it back, making about $22,000. So, why not do it again. Bang. **********I sold another $15 million. But the dollar rose and by the time I got out - I had my shoes shined while I listened to the bad news on the squawk boxes - I had lost nearly $16,000. Burned. **********So where was I? **********For the day, I was up $24,553 and went home with a $5 million long position against the mark. Going home, however, is not a relief from tension for traders who still have positions. Veterans like Mr. Scamardella, the head mark trader, would prefer to avoid the overnight agony and go home square, which means no dollars bought or sold. But with trading going on 24 hours a day, more and more traders work at night.  Falling Two Big Figures **********On Monday's overnight trading in Asia and Europe, the dollar fell against the mark, as they say, two big figures, or 200 pips, from the Monday close in New York. I had put in a stop loss order to sell my $5 million position if the dollar dropped against the mark to 1.9075 - 95 pips below where it ended Monday. I didn't expect this to happen. **********Yet when I came in Tuesday at 7 A.M., I found my position had been sold as a result of the stop loss order and I was already $24,901 in the hole. It was cold comfort that the traders there were just as puzzled as I was about why the dollar fell. The day continued downhill. I managed to dig out of some losses against the mark and ring up profits by doing more quick reversals as the dollar seesawed. **********But, with the dollar down to 1.8970 against the mark, I decided to buy a lousy $2 million. I was sure the dollar would pop up again, following the pattern of the day. But the dollar continued to fall against the mark and wiped out all the profit I had that day. **********I was in even worse trouble against the yen. I had taken a $10 million long position, betting that the dollar would rise. But the dollar was dropping against the yen throughout the day and by the time I went home that night, I had set up an overnight that would keep me up while the dollar was down. **********That night, which I started facing a loss of nearly $40,000, gave me the real feel of a foreign exchange trader, the gnawing ache as a loss grows and grows. With a Metriplex Global 24, a hand-held quote machine, borrowed from James P. Borden, a Chase senior vice president, I was able to watch trading in Tokyo and then in Europe from home. The dollar was above 138.70 against the yen when trading opened in Tokyo and I sat down to dinner, with the Metriplex on the table. **********As the dollar fell later in the evening in Tokyo to below the level at which I had originally decided to sell - my loss had now grown to $55,000 - I did what I should not have done: I gambled and remained with the dollar rather than taking a disciplined loss. **********By morning, after waking and checking the Metriplex by the bed several times during the night - Oh, what relief. The dollar was up over 138.70 against the yen and, by the time I got to work, it was at 139.00. **********I was exhausted. I sat there listening as the dollar creeped up and, by 8:22 A.M. I was out, selling $10 million dollars at 139.25, and avoiding a loss. **********For three days of trading in a tough market, I had taken some big losses and made a few bad mistakes. By staying in and scrambling, I had still made money. I was ahead $12,234 and looking forward to Friday. **********Friday began with an unexpected rise in the dollar in overnight trading in Asia and Europe. It was now 1.93 against the mark, up more than two big figures. Even Mr. Scamardella, who earlier had said he thought the dollar would soon rise to 1.94 marks, was shaking his head for not following his own forecast. ''Why don't my ears listen when my mouth talks,'' he wondered. **********Friday was the kind of day that can be a trader's dream. Two important economic reports were due - retail sales figures and the Producer Price Index for finished goods, both for July. After a trendless week, this data could start a move that traders could jump on and make money. **********In the fifteen minutes following the release of the economic data, the trading room became a frantic, noisy scramble for dollars. The decline in the price index and increase in retail sales appeared on the screens and were shouted out. The price index showed lower inflation and the retail sales figure showed the economy was not as weak as expected. Both were positive for the dollar.  An Easy Day, At Last **********Once I saw the dollar would continue up, it was easy. Buy dollars and then sell them at a profit. I made over $76,000 in half an hour. Soon, I was more than $155,000 in the black. **********And when the Federal Reserve and other central banks sold dollars to slow the rally, I saw intervention first hand. But it didn't make a difference. It just pushed the dollar lower and then traders, including me, would swoop in and buy the cheaper dollars, making a little extra profit as it rose again. How did I do? A $167,686 profit for the week. **********Mr. Kessler, who would not be specific about earnings, said I fared well. But he said I should have made more money on Friday. I was not aggressive enough in buying the dollar when it was rising. **********A new job? No thanks. It's too up and down. I know now why it's a young man's game and I'm not John Gaines, Chase's gray eminence, at 45. ''I guess its a young man's game, but there are a few dinosaurs around,'' he said. Not me."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/17/business/business-digest-saturday-june-17-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 627, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY JUNE 17, 1989", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY JUNE 17, 1989", "body_text": " **********Companies **********Time offered to buy Warner Communications for $14 billion in a defiant response to Paramount's hostile offer to take over Time.

''We may begin to see some money coming out of the money market funds and moving to Treasuries,'' he said. **********Donoghue's seven-day taxable, compounded average yield for a money market mutual fund was up by a basis point, to 9.58 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield was unchanged at 9.60 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********The assets of taxable money funds increased by $4.5 billion, to $300.9 billion. **********Analysts say at least half of the increase could be attributed to investors still unsure of long-term rates and from bank certificates of deposit that have recently begun to decline. Maturity Days Rise **********The average number of days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios rose for the first time in five weeks, to 36 from 34. **********According to Donoghue's, the highest-yielding general-purpose money market fund with assets of at least $100 million is the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a yield of 10.74 percent, after absorbing fees. **********In the tax-exempt market, funds were also little changed, as assets increased by only $40 million, to $64 billion. **********The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-free funds increased by a basis point, to 6.60 percent. To earn a comparable return in taxable funds, investors in a 28 percent tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 9.19 percent, while those in a 33 percent bracket would need to earn 9.84 percent. **********Of the funds surveyed by Donoghue's, the Kemper Money Market Fund Tax Exempt Portfolio remains the top one, yielding 7.34 percent. **********Elsewhere, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed that the average yield for a bank money market account was unchanged at 6.63 percent, while the average six-month certificate of deposit was off by four basis points, to 9.27 percent. **********Certificates with longer maturities were lower, with a one-year C.D. down by six basis points, to 9.42 percent, and two-and-a-half-year and five-year certificates off by four basis points each, to 9.23 percent and 9.14 percent, respectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/business/ford-raises-prices-for-1990-models.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1989-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Raises Prices for 1990 Models", "print_headline": "Ford Raises Prices for 1990 Models", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company said today that it had tentatively raised its 1990 model prices by an average of 4.8 percent, its largest increase in recent years, mostly because of the added cost of installing safety air bags or motorized seat belts mandated for the first time by Federal law. **********Thomas J. Wagner, general manager of the Ford division, said the prices would rise 2.5 percent over current models with comparable equipment. Last fall, Ford raised prices for comparably equipped vehicles by 2.6 percent. The General Motors Corporation raised its prices by 2.9 percent, and the Chrysler Corporation raised prices 2.3 percent. G.M. and Chrysler have not yet disclosed their price plans for 1990. New Incentives Offered **********But even as it raised prices for next year's models, Ford introduced a more generous incentives program for this year's models, to match the bigger discounts offered recently by G.M. and Chrysler. **********The Big Three auto makers are offering the new incentives to clear 1989 models from dealers' showrooms, making way for the 1990 products. But the downturn in the industry has also forced them to slow production. Even Ford, which had run at full capacity for several years, has idled several plants in the last two months. **********Incentives were first used as a short-range marketing tool, to shift customers from a company's scarce products to its more abundant ones, or to shift sales from one season to another. That helped Detroit bring the seasonal peaks and troughs of demand closer to the much smoother curve of mass production. **********But in this decade incentives have become a fixture that no manufacturer can disregard, if only to preserve its market share against deep-discounting rivals. Customers have grown accustomed to the programs and know that if they do not rush to get expiring incentives, new ones will soon take their place. **********The 1990 prices that Ford announced today are preliminary ones quoted to dealers, who are already taking early orders for fall delivery. In the past, they have generally reflected the final prices. **********Mr. Wagner acknowledged that mentioning the cause of the price increase might not mollify car buyers who do not want to spend money on such safety equipment. Few people choose these features in current models that offer them as options. **********''These numbers are larger than they were in the past, but we have to recover our costs,'' he said. Mr. Wagner said there was no evidence for some analysts' conjecture that the higher sales numbers recently reported for the first 20 days of July were attributable to people choosing to buy 1989 models now to avoid the higher prices of the 1990 models. **********Mr. Wagner said Ford's inventories were within the normal range for the season, at 66 days' supply for cars and 70 days for light trucks. But the company has slowed production because its dealers are ordering fewer cars, he said. **********Ross H. Roberts, general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury division, said the new Ford incentives program increased cash rebates but offered less generous financing as an alternative, a change in emphasis that reflects the decline in interest rates. **********Rebates were increased by $100 to $750 on 10 cars and two light trucks. The Ford Festiva LX was discounted by an additional $100, to $600, while the rebates for the standard Thunderbird and Cougar doubled, to $1,500.

Because of their belief in the market, their faith in technology and their suspiciousness of the state, I call this generation of reformers the Atari Communists - after the high-tech, free-market Atari Democrats of California, Colorado and elsewhere. **********As a group, these high-tech Communists are revising the definition of East Bloc and Chinese Socialism as we have known it in this century. For these thinkers, Socialism no longer means central planning and the collective ownership of the means of production. **********Although the new ''Reform International'' is not directed from Mikhail Gorbachev's Moscow, its unity, paradoxically, stems from the common imperative to correct the Stalinist path of centrally planned development that was universally adopted during the height of Moscow's influence in the 1950's. That path led to economic ruin in the Eastern Bloc, just as the West was advancing into the post-industrial Information Age. **********I learned firsthand about the reforms spreading across the Communist world during recent conversations with Politburo ideologists and key economic reformers in Beijing, Budapest and Moscow. **********In an unusually wide-ranging discussion in one of the cavernous chambers in the Great Hall of the People, party ideology chief Hu Qili - the most liberal and youngest member of the five-man standing committee that rules China - made the clearest statement to date about the final objectives of the party for the economy. **********''Capitalism has no patent right over the market,'' Mr. Hu asserted. When asked if under fully developed Chinese Socialism, the market would be superior to centralized planning, Mr. Hu simply replied: ''Yes.'' Envisioning the new modality that combines the market with public ownership, Mr. Hu said: ''Our final objective is to expose all enterprises - individual, state, private and collective - to market competition.'' **********The party ideologist also vigorously promoted the idea of stock ownership both as a means of making management more responsive to market forces and to give workers who can own shares a stronger sense of being the master of their enterprise. **********Despite repeated reports in the Western press that the key market and pricing objectives of reform were being rolled back, Mr. Hu insisted that price reform was a firm objective of Chinese leadership and the basis of all other reforms. **********If it weren't for the fact that talk of this kind was tumbling from the lips of party ideologists within earshot of Mao's embalmed body, it would be hard to believe it was Communism we were discussing. **********In Budapest I spoke at length with the ideology chief of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, 56-year-old Janos Berecz. Looking very unlike a party ideologist in his blue, button-down Oxford shirt and Swatch watch, Mr. Berecz also heralded the coming reign of the market. ''If the market gets into conflict with the plan, the plan will have to be modified,'' he told me without hesitation. **********Already one can observe nearly as many Mercedes-Benzes in the hills of Buda these days as in Beverly Hills. **********With reform, said Mr. Berecz: ''something new, or rather an old matter, will reappear. The private entrepreneur will once again become the owner of part of the value he produces. This used to be called exploitation. But, if the wealth created by entrepreneurs helps improve the standard of living of the whole nation, then it must be considered inequality, not social injustice.'' **********Going further than the Chinese who still envision 51 percent collective ownership of any firm, Mr. Berecz said he envisioned 100 percent private ownership of enterprises - by either domestic or foreign investors - with one-third or more of the economy returning to private ownership. **********But the most startling statements of all came in Moscow, the birthplace of monopoly state ownership and central-planning dogma. Still lagging far behind in practice, Moscow leaped ahead in ideological reform with Mr. Gorbachev's Sept. 30 appointment of Vadim Medvedev as the Kremlin's ideology chief. Although Mr. Medvedev, with his erect posture, silver hair, sober countenance and dark suits looks like the classic reactionary raven of the party apparatus, his economic and ideological prounouncements belie the image. **********Mr. Medvedev readily admitted that ''by the end of the 1970's, Socialism had lost its advantage over capitalism in the race for economic development.'' In a stunning abandonment of Soviet Marxism, which saw the state's socialization of all private property as the key to ending man's alienation from his labor, Mr. Medvedev forcefully argued that ''the key reform now is restructuring property relations and ending the state of alienation between people and public property.'' He added: ''We must now admit that our previous concepts of public property have proved untenable.'' **********Abel Aganbegyan, one of Mr. Gorbachev's top economic advisers, emphasized the shift away from a collectively owned workers' state. ''We do not talk about a 'state of the workers' as before,'' Mr. Aganbegyan told me. ''We now talk about the 'nation' as a whole and the 'middle class' as the main class. Our top priority is meeting the social needs of our people by building an economy where the production of goods and services is guided by consumer demand.'' **********Acknowledging that what he was describing more closely resembled a dictatorship of the consumer than of the proletariat, Mr. Aganbegyan made it clear that only ''plural forms of ownership'' subject to the forces of market competition could bring about such a consumer society. **********Those forms of economic pluralism would include family and individual enterprises; cooperatives; the self-management of collectively owned property; and the leasing of state property for private use on the widest scale possible. **********For the Reform International, Socialism no longer means central planning and the collective ownership of the means of production.

Gorbachev. Scheduled for mid-May, it is expected to produce a formal end to the 30-year rift between the two nations. **********At a luncheon meeting with Mr. Deng on Sunday, according to a briefing by Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, the President said the United States saw the meeting ''as an important and useful step in providing stability to the region and the world,'' and not as a threat to relations between Beijing and Washington. Dissident Barred From Dinner **********''I have emerged from these talks convinced that U.S.-China relations are strong,'' Mr. Bush said at a Texas-style barbecue dinner that he gave at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel on Sunday evening for the Chinese leaders. And at a meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng, he pointed out that American foreign policy in many parts of the world was under review, but not China policy. **********The spirit of good will was marred, however, when China, in a harsh rebuke to the growing enthusiasm for democracy, prevented the country's best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, from attending the dinner. He had been invited by the President.  [ Page A8. ]  Mr. Bush ''expressed his regret'' this morning about the incident to the ranking Chinese official who came to see him off, Mr. Fitzwater said. It was a form of response considered a good deal milder than deploring it or officially protesting it. The answer given by the official, Wu Xueqian, a vice premier and former foreign minister, was not known. In an apparent attempt to play down the incident, Mr. Fitzwater also said that only Mr. Fang among the five dissidents asked to the dinner had been prevented by the authorities from attending; the others all gained entry to the event. **********Responding to suggestions that Mr. Bush had put inadequate emphasis on human rights during his Beijing visit, the press secretary said: ''Human rights is one aspect of the relationship, and it's one that was important enough for us to raise it in at least two forums. On the other hand, we wouldn't want to say it's the cornerstone of the relationship. We have a lot of other issues that also are very important to the relationship.'' **********The last two sentences of the statement by the Presidential spokesman appeared to represent a departure from American policy in the Reagan era, when human rights in Communist countries was at the top of the President's agenda. In a long formal statement, summing up Mr. Bush's 40 hours in Beijing, moreover, Mr. Fitzwater listed several things that had '' delighted'' the President, but included only a brief, oblique reference to the Fang affair: ''We hope for more progress in human rights.'' **********Mr. Fang, an astrophysicist and human rights campaigner, was invited by the President amid considerable fanfare a few days ago. Hours after he failed to appear, well after midnight, he turned up in the White House press briefing room to tell reporters how he, his wife and two American friends had been prevented by policemen from driving or walking to the hotel. **********One of the friends, Perry Link, head of the Beijing office of the National Academy of Sciences, confirmed the scientist's account, which, Mr. Fang said, provided ''a fresh example of the human rights situation in China.'' Address to National Assembly **********Nearing the end of his five-day Asian tour, the President declared in a speech to the National Assembly in Seoul that ''there are no plans to reduce United States forces.'' He said the troops, who face those of the hard-line Kim Il Sung regime across the demilitarized zone, will remain ''as long as they are needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace.'' **********But he laid equal emphasis on the attempt by President Roh Tae Woo to improve relations with the North - an effort that many Koreans expect to lead to a meeting between Mr. Roh and Mr. Kim sometime later this year. **********''I will work closely with President Roh to coordinate our efforts to draw the North toward practical, peaceful and productive dialogue, to insure that our policies are complementary and mutually reinforcing,'' the President declared, and before leaving Beijing he urged the Chinese to use their connections in Pyongyang to help the process of rapprochement along a bit. **********Mr. Bush also prodded the Koreans, as he had the Chinese, about cutting red tape and eliminating other barriers to free trade. He told the Assembly, in what he described as ''my first major address on foreign soil'' since moving into the White House, that ''your economic success has created concerns'' about the big American trade deficit with South Korea. **********''Let me be candid,'' the President said. ''If we are to keep our bilateral relationship growing even stronger much more needs to be done.'' A High Point of Trip **********Mr. Bush also met with Mr. Roh and spoke briefly to the American community here before he and his wife, Barbara, began the long flight back across the Pacific. **********The Chinese part of the trip constituted a high point for the Bushes, who lived in Beijing in 1974 and 1975, when he was serving as head of the United States liaison office. It was ''a happy, challenging time in our lives,'' the President recalled this weekend. **********The Chinese went all-out to make him feel welcome, with flags of the two countries and multicolored banners strung up along Chang An Road, the city's main thoroughfare, which the Bush motoracdes traversed several times as they whisked him and his party from one event to another to yet another. **********The President's mood seemed jubilant all day, and he lost no chance to praise the Chinese leadership. **********At the dinner, which featured such down-home comestibles as barbecued chicken, brisket of beef and pork sausage, plus potato salad and baked beans and peach cobbler, Mr. Bush praised Mr. Deng as a leader who had met the politician's ultimate test of changing his country for the better and said he would ''be counted among the pre-eminent statesmen of our times.'' 'New Breeze' in China **********In a live interview on Chinese television, described by the United States Ambassador, Winston Lord, as unprecedented for a visiting chief of state, the President recalled that in his inaugural he had spoken of a ''new breeze blowing'' in the world. He added, ''China was one of the first nations to feel this new breeze, and like a tree in the winter wind, you have learned to bend and adapt to new ideas.'' **********Mr. Bush met for more than two hours with Prime Minister Li, a meeting that Mr. Fitzwater termed ''remarkable and unprecedented.'' The spokesman said they talked about a wide range of topics, including terrorism, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Chinese reforms and missile proliferation. **********On the last point, the spokesman reported that Mr. Li had repeated assurances, originally given to Frank C. Carlucci, then the Secretary of Defense, in October 1988, that China would ''act responsibly'' on missile sales. The President, who has expressed concern over Chinese sales of Silkworm missiles to Iran and other sales elsewhere, was said to be satisfied. **********White House officials appeared in some doubt about the exact shape of the conversation. They could not say, for example, whether there had been any discussion about alleged transshipments of missiles through North Korea. Bush 'Relatively Pleased' **********Asked if Mr. Bush got a commitment from Mr. Li not to sell Silkworms to the Iranians, the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, gave a vague reply and said only that the President and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had been ''relatively pleased'' with the outcome of the discussion. **********There was also some confusion on the subject of human rights.

''Therefore, what I must do now to regain their political trust is to introduce political reforms.'' **********However, the details offered by Mr. Takeshita about the money he had received appeared likely to confuse matters rather than to clarify them. **********The Prime Minister contended that he or his political organization had received the equivalent of $692,000 from the Recruit Company, the information-services conglomerate that has been at the heart of the scandal. This was less than the $1 million that newspapers reported in the last two weeks he had received in 1986 and 1987, when he was campaigning for Prime Minister. **********In making his disclosures, Mr. Takeshita listed new contributions that had not yet come to light, so that opponents were saying this morning that, in fact, he or his operatives or relatives had actually received $1.15 million in contributions. Money Routed Elsewhere **********Mr. Takeshita asserted that at least part of the discrepancies arose because some of the funds that supposedly went to him in fact were given to a member of his staff and a distant relative, one of his daughter's in-laws. He said he would make a full disclosure of these funds. **********In addition, the Prime Minister said that other funds he supposedly received went to other political organizations allied but not directly tied to his own. **********Answering sometimes harsh questions from opposition political leaders, Mr. Takeshita said he would accept full responsibility for the public's deepening distrust of politicians, including his Government, that resulted from the scandal. **********He gave no details of his intended reforms, but officials of his Liberal Democratic Party said that such changes would include new ceilings on campaign contributions by businesses and changes in the way legislative districts are drawn, reducing the number of candidates and, presumably, the need for costly campaigns. **********The sharpest questioner was Kanji Kawasaki, leader of the Japan Socialist Party, who dismissed Mr. Takeshita's contention that he could change the system. **********''You aren't qualified to make political reforms,'' he declared. ''You're hands are dirty.'' In addition, Mr. Kawasaki asked Mr. Takeshita why he had told Parliament last October, when the scandal began, that he had received no campaign money at all from the Recruit Company, and whether the Prime Minister had been lying at the time. Says He Was Uninformed **********Mr. Takeshita replied that he was then unaware of these contributions, and that they had only come to light after his staff had investigated records. He said he would make changes by ''humbly listening to the people's voices'' and denied charges that he had been passive as the scandal spread. **********There were no indications whether Mr. Takeshita's new statements would end the parliamentary stalemate or the political crisis in general. Nor was there any indication of a resolution either of the dispute over whether the former Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, also implicated in the scandal, should be required to testify in Parliament, as demanded by the opposition. **********The disclosures about Mr. Takeshita in the last week have badly damaged his political standing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/22/world/us-admiral-sees-better-soviet-ties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ADMIRAL SEES BETTER SOVIET TIES", "print_headline": "U.S. ADMIRAL SEES BETTER SOVIET TIES", "body_text": " **********The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said here today that he believed that the United States and the Soviet Union ''now have an environment where we can talk candidly.'' But he cautioned against expecting swift progress in solving thorny differences on arms control. **********The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. William J. Crowe, made the comments at a news conference at the end of a 10-day visit to the Soviet Union. **********He said that in his time touring Soviet naval and military bases from Murmansk, in the north of Russia, to Samarkand, in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, he had the opportunity to speak with military leaders and rank-and-file personnel. **********''The most constructive thing that I did on this trip was to have personal conversations with the Soviet leadership,'' said the admiral, who traveled the country with his Soviet counterpart, Col. Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev. Dispute on Soviet Military Budget **********Through those discussions, Admiral Crowe said, ''We have been able to sweep aside some of the misunderstanding between us and to clarify some of our differences.'' **********But he emphasized that despite such warm talks, it ''will take a great deal of time and patience on both sides'' to resolve key differences. He warned that ''if there's any danger'' to the negotiation process ''it's that people become impatient and ask for too much too quickly.'' **********''Many, many people are prone to hear a statement made, a policy announced, and immediately look out their window and say, 'I don't see it,' '' Admiral Crowe said, adding, ''These kind of changes are difficult to fashion and I do not expect them to happen momentarily.'' **********One key question that the Americans still feel is unresolved is the true size of the Soviet military budget, Admiral Crowe said. ''We have discussed that subject at various times during my visit,'' he said. No Attempt to Conceal Seen **********President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced this month that the Soviet Union's overall military budget was 77.3 billion rubles, about $125 billion at the exchange rate of $1.62 to the ruble, officially set by the Soviet Government. **********The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that the Soviet military budget is actually 115 billion to 125 billion rubles. **********But since the value of the ruble is not set by the open market, Admiral Crowe said, it is difficult to reconcile the Soviet and Western figures. But he said he was convinced that the discrepancy was in no way an attempt at ''concealment'' by the Soviets. **********''The difficulties of comparing their budget with American currency are very deep and very difficult,'' he said. **********General Moiseyev, who joined Admiral Crowe in speaking to Soviet and foreign journalists, suggested that a scale could perhaps be achieved by comparing the costs of equivalent items in the budget. **********He offered, by way of example, a comparison of the production cost of a Soviet Sukhoi-25 strike plane, with the American analogue, the F-16. The Soviet model, he said, cost 5.8 million rubles, or $9.6 million to produce, while the American equivalent cost $16 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/15/business/the-moment-of-truth-can-lotus-do-it-again.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1989-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Moment of Truth: Can Lotus Do It Again?", "print_headline": "The Moment of Truth: Can Lotus Do It Again?", "body_text": " **********It's white-knuckle time for the Lotus Development Corporation. **********On Tuesday, after more than a year's postponement, the company will ship the first copies of a more powerful version of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet program - if no further bugs are found. **********Succeeding with a new version of 1-2-3 is a must for Lotus. After five years of unchallenged domination of the growing market for spreadsheet software, the world's most popular computer program is looking frayed around the edges. Competitors like the Microsoft Corporation and Borland International, although trailing in market share, are winning the feature war. To put it back in front, Lotus is counting on 1-2-3 Release 3.0, which has dozens of new features, including the ability to create and calculate three-dimensional spreadsheets. Two Years of Delays **********The introduction comes after two years of delays and slowing financial growth that have put Lotus constantly on the defensive. The company, often attacked as arrogant, has been humbled by failing several times when it tried to enter the growing market for software that will run on Apple Computer Inc.'s popular Macintosh. Worst of all, Lotus has begun to lose some of its home turf in the spreadsheet market. **********As Lotus's top executive sees it, almost everything is riding on the new program. For him, the delays, bad press and loss of credibility have been a personal challenge. **********''I think I'll consider putting a gun to my head if we don't make it this time,'' said Jim Manzi, chairman and chief executive. **********When they appeared early in this decade, spreadsheets turned out to be the key program that the personal computer industry was waiting for. They allow people who work with financial information to manipulate and display numbers easily, automatically making complex calculations, testing financial hypotheses and analyzing information in new ways. **********Spreadsheets allow the user to place numbers in rows and columns, like an accountant's ledger sheet, and then manipulate them. **********It is difficult to overestimate the importance of Release 3.0 to Lotus. On the strength of 1-2-3, the company, based in Cambridge, Mass., is now No. 2 in personal computer software behind Microsoft, but so far it has fallen short in its efforts to match that performance in other software categories. Analysts say Lotus badly needs another hit. **********The success or failure of the latest revision to 1-2-3, which in the last five years has become the standard financial analysis tool for almost five million computer users, will be closely watched by customers, competitors and Wall Street analysts. Worst May Be Over **********But the worst may be behind the company. Lotus, which has drawn criticism for investing heavily in exotic programs that are difficult to explain to average computer users, has refocused its efforts on the heart of its business, what the company calls ''analytical tools.'' For example, the company is now rethinking how to market an ambitious program called Notes, designed to permit office workers to share information. **********''We want to do an A-plus job on our core business first,'' Mr. Manzi said. As a result of that new focus, Wall Street seems to have regained its confidence in Lotus. The company's stock has traded recently as high as $26.75 after falling as low as $15 in October. It closed yesterday at $26. **********Moreover, Mr. Manzi's toughest competitors are now more reticent to criticize him and Lotus. **********Microsoft, which prides itself on its technical prowess, was embarrassed recently when it reported that it would be late in shipping crucial software programs. Earlier this week the stock of the Ashton-Tate Company plummeted when the company said it would have a loss in the second and possibly the third quarter because of slow sales of its data base manager program. **********At the same time, reports from corporate customers who are testing Release 3.0 have been positive, and Lotus has been growing more confident that the program will quickly live up to its potential. 'An Interesting Product' **********''It's an interesting product with new features we're anxious to move to,'' said Jude Garland, a senior vice president in the investment banking division of Shearson Lehman Hutton. ''Just having the third dimension makes a big difference in the ability to organize a spreadsheet.'' **********The third dimension provided by Release 3.0 is to allow the user to ''stack'' ledger sheets, providing a potentially powerful new tool. One strong point that the final version of Release 3.0 is demonstrating, early testers say, is that it will perform well on standard I.B.M. PC/AT compatible machines, which is essential if the new program is to compete against Microsoft's Excel program. Expected to Be Cumbersome **********There had been concerns that the program would be slow and cumbersome on older, less powerful computers, which now make up about half of the PC market. **********''I'm overjoyed with the program,'' said Jerry Gaffney, an early tester who runs a small travel agency in Seattle. ''For a small-business man's applications, it more than outperforms Excel.'' **********Wall Street analysts now project that Lotus will ship 400,000 to 700,000 copies in the form of sales and upgrades for earlier versions of 1-2-3. Strong early sales of the program could provide a big lift for Lotus in the second half of the year. Some Wall Street analysts suggest that the company could post fourth-quarter earnings of 80 to 90 cents a share, compared with 21 cents last year. **********But more important than short-term financial improvement, a favorable reception for Release 3.0 will be a big first step in Lotus's grand strategy of offering a common set of spreadsheet software across a wide range of computer brands. 'Core Technology' **********Release 3.0 has what the company calls ''core technology'' that it plans to transfer in short order to a variety of other computers. Lotus is planning a version that offers graphics for more advanced computers from the International Business Machines Corporation to be released early next year. There will also be translations for work stations from Next Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. and even one for I.B.M.'s most powerful mainframe system. **********Many analysts have felt that the strategy - virtually the opposite of the one Lotus rode to success with the first version of 1-2-3, finely tuned for the I.B.M. PC - carries a great deal of risk. **********''It's dangerous to ignore the lessons of history,'' said Stewart Alsop, publisher of PC Letter. The danger is that in developing a product for many different types of hardware, a software developer may end up with one that does not run exceptionally well in any one environment. **********A more difficult question is whether the Lotus strategy of segmenting the I.B.M. PC market will be successful. Because not all the features of Release 3.0 will fit in the limited memory of a standard I.B.M. PC, Lotus plans to offer a second program called Release 2.2, scheduled to be released during the third quarter of this year and designed to offer an upgrade for those who do not want to move to more powerful computers. Initial Price of $495 **********Each program will initially sell for $495, with an upgrade available for $150. Next year the price of Release 3.0 will rise to $595. Lotus executives say they are still not certain which program will be more popular. **********''Strong 2.2 sales are anticipated,'' Mr. Manzi said. ''But a lot of smart money in the company says that 2.2 will outsell 3.0. I'm personally bullish on 3.0.'' **********But he adds that regardless of which choice Lotus users make, they will stay within the Lotus family. **********That view is challenged by Phillipe Kahn, chairman of Borland. Borland's Quattro spreadsheet, which has many features lacking in early Lotus spreadsheets, made some inroads against Lotus when it was introduced in 1987. But its growth has slowed recently. Now Mr. Kahn has been touring the country giving customers and analysts an early look at Quattro 2.0, an enhanced version designed to run in standard I.B.M PC's, in which Borland will include many features that Lotus left out of its Release 3.0, like graphics. Preparing a Response **********Microsoft is also preparing a response to Lotus. On Monday the company will announce an enhancement to its Excel spreadsheet program aimed at easing the import and export of data base information. **********''I'm very comfortable with our position,'' said Pete Higgins, general manager for Microsoft's analysis business unit. ''They're not doing anything that really challenges Excel in terms of product capabilities.'' **********Yet despite all the interest in features and flashy new software technology, it may be inertia that saves the day for Lotus. The easy choice for millions of spreadsheet users is not to switch brands. **********''You can't underestimate the loyalty or apathy of the 1-2-3 installed base,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. ''Whatever word you use, they just don't want to switch.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/business/briefs-361889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 471, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Steel and Wire Corp., Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, a maker of shelving and other storage products, said its board had rejected as inadequate the increased acquisition offer of $9.50 a share by Chicago West Pullman Corp., Cincinnati, a railroad and steel company. *********** Brae Corp., San Francisco, a designer of visual electronic communications systems, said it would entertain proposals for the purchase of all of the company's outstanding stock at a price not less than book value. *********** Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said its board had adopted a shareholder rights plan that would be exercisable if a person or group acquired 20 percent or more of the company's common stock.

The S.E.C. said the bank often covered the partners' checks overnight when the funds in the account were not sufficient. **********The investors then opened 250 accounts at more than 100 brokerage firms, using 76 names, the S.E.C. said.

Shultz, have also tried to meet with Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories during the 20-month uprising. But most or all of the Palestinians refused, suggesting that the Americans meet with the Palestine Liberation Organization instead. **********Today, however, 13 of the 14 Palestinians invited to meet with Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly attended. But the first thing they made clear was that they considered themselves only agents for the Palestine Liberation Organization, which officially sanctioned meetings like this last month.

They said he urged them to take advantage of the ''golden opportunity'' presented by Israel's peace initiative. 'Atmosphere Wasn't Friendly' **********Mustafa Natsheh, the former deputy mayor of Hebron, said the group told Mr. Kelly that elections in the territories ''must be part of a comprehensive settlement, as a means to more, but not the target of the problem.'' **********Palestinians described the two-hour meeting with Mr. Kelly as stormy and said he accused the group of ''playing polemics'' by asserting that the encounter was part of the United States dialogue with the P.L.O. **********''The atmosphere wasn't friendly, but it was the frankest expression of views we've had so far,'' said a Palestinian participant who asked not to be identified. He said Mr. Kelly flatly told the group the United States opposes the creation of a Palestinian state. **********Radwan Abu Ayyash, a journalist in the delegation, said Mr. Kelly told the group ''he would not deliver us to the negotiation table, and said we have to make our own way.'' Points Made in the Letter **********The Palestinians' letter also called on the United States to ''demonstrate a genuine commitment'' to the peace process by accepting these points: *********** Recognition of Palestinian ''self-determination,'' which in Palestinian parlance means a Palestinian state. *********** Action by the United States to force the Israelis to withdraw from the occupied territories. *********** An international peace conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict. *********** Equal treatment of Palestinians and Israelis on all matters of ''independence, sovereignty, security, recognition, national rights and guarantees.'' **********As Mr. Kelly met with the Palestinians, there was more violence in the occupied Gaza Strip. A hand grenade thrown at a passing Israeli patrol wounded three Israeli soldiers and three Palestinian civilians, army and Arab reports said. Troops opened fire after the blast, wounding more than a dozen Palestinians in the town of Khan Yunis, The Associated Press quoted hospital officials as saying.  SOME ARAB SCHOOLS REOPEN **********JERUSALEM, Aug. 3 (Reuters) -Israel has reopened more than 300 West Bank Arab junior high schools that have been closed for most of the 19-month Palestinian uprising. **********About 69,000 Palestinian children in grades seven, eight and nine returned to 324 schools Wednesday without incident, said a spokeswoman for the Israeli military authorities on the West Bank.

Production of recombinant human insulin using genetic engineering was pioneered by Eli Lilly & Company in 1979. That human insulin is based on swine insulin, which is virtually identical except for its amino acids. Complaint by Citizens' Group **********An administrative court in the state of Hesse ruled in favor of a citizens' group that had filed a complaint against Hoechst. Although not ruling on questions of safety or ethics, the court ordered the company to stop construction immediately on a test plant for production of human insulin. **********Genetic engineering is an emotionally charged issue in Germany. Research efforts and industrial applications have been bitterly opposed by environmental groups and the Green Party. These groups feel that such experiments could create forms of life that could have disastrous consequences on the environment. The remembrance of Nazi medical experiments disguised as genetic research is also said to feed the opposition. **********The court said that ''as long as the parliament does not specifically allow the use of gene technology,'' plants using such technology ''may not be constructed and operated regardless of the assessment of the danger they pose in individual cases.'' **********The West German Government has been working on laws covering all aspects of gene technology. But parliamentary officials have said that passage of any laws during the current legislative period, which ends in late 1990, was unlikely. Government Cautious **********Because of the pressure from citizen groups, the Government has been cautious in its approach to genetic technology, and long licensing procedures have discouraged most chemical companies from investing in genetic research and production. **********Government officials and politicians opposed to the ruling Christian Democratic Party said the decision highlighted the need for legislation. **********''This is the bitter revenge for years of delay on this issue,'' said a parliamentary deputy for the opposition Social Democratic Party. ''But if the court is trying to say we can't have genetic research here, however well meaning the court intends that to be, it is not taking into account the reality of the situation. We have had genetic research and production here for a long time. What we need urgently are laws regulating it.'' Ruling Called Regrettable **********Prof. Arnold Gries, a genetic researcher at the University of Dusseldorf, called the ruling regrettable. He added: ''An entire direction of research in West Germany has been put on ice. For someone who knows these materials, the fears of this technology are difficult to comprehend.'' **********A spokesman for Hoechst, Dieter Brauer, told the Reuters news service that the company viewed the ruling ''with great concern.'' He added, ''It means the future industrial use of genetic engineering techniques in West Germany is seriously jeopardized.'' **********The company's original application to build and operate the plant, which addressed many of the scientific and philosophical issues raised by genetic engineering, was filed in 1985 and has been stalled by legal action initiated by opponents. That case is expected to come to court sometime next year, Mr. Brauer said. Obtained Injunction **********Construction of the plant began after Hoechst obtained a court injunction in July 1988. An appeal against the injunction by Action Alliance Against Gene Technology Hoechst, a citizens group opposing gene-technology research, was rejected in November 1988. Today's decision resulted from an appeal of that ruling to a higher court. **********Mr. Brauer said Hoechst had so far spent about 60 million Deutsche marks ($32.5 million) on the human insulin project. No industrial-scale tests of insulin production have been conducted, he said. Total costs of the project are likely to be higher than 150 million marks ($80 million) by the time a decision on the original application is made, he added. **********Hoechst is one of West Germany's three largest chemical concerns. The two others, BASF A.G. and Bayer A.G., have moved some of their genetic research operations abroad to avoid the emotional opposition, but Hoechst has said it will keep its genetic technology activities in West Germany. Reaction in U.S. In the United States, representatives of American biotechnology companies said they were disappointed but not surprised by the German court decision, noting that public opposition to biotechnology has been stronger in West Germany than elsewhere. They noted that some countries, including France, were seeking to attract biotechnology production."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/14/business/five-to-get-us-grants-for-advanced-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1989-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Five to Get U.S. Grants for Advanced TV", "print_headline": "Five to Get U.S. Grants for Advanced TV", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon said yesterday that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had selected five companies to receive grants to develop high-definition television technology for both consumer and military applications. **********High-definition television, or HDTV, which produces images as sharp and as detailed as those for movies, is expected to be a $50 billion industry by the year 2000.

Only by collecting more dollars could foreign companies maintain their revenues and profits in yen or marks. **********They have indeed raised prices - not as much as economists had predicted but by enough to have a potentially big impact on inflation in the United States. Since the dollar began its decline in March 1985, the producer or wholesale prices that foreign businesses charge their American customers for thousands of products - including cameras, cars, steel, clothing, wine, machinery and medical equipment - have risen by an average of 26.2 percent. Most of this large increase has occurred in the last two years, according to Government data. **********But a puzzling fact is that many of those price increases have not yet been passed on to the final consumer. The contribution of these increases to the 4.4 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index last year was less - perhaps much less - than five-tenths of one percentage point, estimates Catherine L. Mann, an economist at the World Bank who has studied the exchange rate-inflation relationship. Many economists had expected the contribution to be at least five-tenths of a percentage point. **********The Government does not calculate the impact of rising import prices on the C.P.I. But anecdotal evidence supports the contention that the impact has been mild. **********''The pass-through is not minimal but has been less than historical trends would have suggested,'' said Nigel Gault, a senior economist at Data Resources Inc. **********Whether the pass-through will continue to be modest, however, is anyone's guess. Some economists and business executives see signs that price increases for imported goods are beginning to accelerate, a development more likely to take root if the dollar falls more. If that happens, and if the economy remains strong, more of the price increases will be passed on to the final consumer, some economists and business executives warn. **********But others believe that growing competition from such newly industrialized nations as South Korea and Thailand will constrain the ability of Japanese and European companies - and also American companies - to raise prices in the United States . **********Increasing the likelihood that import prices will remain a relatively small factor in inflation is the fact that American companies have changed the way they buy materials, components and machinery from abroad. They are increasingly trying to persuade suppliers to hold down prices - by promising them long-term relationships, for example, or by pitting one supplier against another. **********The hold-down in prices is not uniform, of course. Rising import prices are passed along quickly to consumers when the product involved is in great demand and nothing quite like it is made in the United States. The Japanese, for example, are virtually the only manufacturers of 35-millimeter cameras, and such cameras today cost 50 to 60 percent more in retail stores in the United States than they did in 1985. **********The wholesale prices of European wines have risen by more than 25 percent since 1985. Zachy's, a big liquor store in Scarsdale, N.Y., for one, did not increase its prices for French wine substantially until last year, when it raised them by 15 to 20 percent. From 1985 through 1987, Zachy's had not raised them by more than 5 percent annually. **********''We had inventories to sell from, and we wanted to be competitive with domestic wines,'' said Garnett Eisner, Zachy's manager. But he said that wholesale prices finally rose so much that he had no choice but to pass them through. **********The more common experience, however, is that of Caterpillar Inc. Like so many American manufacturers, Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., is a big buyer of parts, machinery and materials from abroad. These purchases constitute a huge portion of the country's total imports. **********In Caterpillar's case, 20 percent of all the items that the company uses to manufacture earth movers, tractors and other heavy equipment are purchased from overseas suppliers. These include steel from Brazil, automated welders from Sweden, machine tools from West Germany and Japan, and French-made steel castings that are honed into cutting edges for the plows that go on Caterpillar's tractors and earth movers. **********Some of the computer-controlled, multimillion-dollar machine tools brought from Europe and Japan for Caterpillar's Peoria factory simply are not available in the United States. Their prices have risen more than 30 percent since 1985, including a 10 percent increase in the last 18 months, said Robert Dryden, a purchasing vice president at Caterpillar. **********But Mr. Dryden said Caterpillar had been able ''to insulate itself from the effect of the weaker dollar'' by constantly switching suppliers. The steel castings for cutting edges had been made by a Nebraska company, but the business went to a French concern, which, despite the strong franc, was willing to accept a price 20 percent lower than the Nebraska company's, Mr. Dryden said. **********On the other hand, 70 percent of the starting motors for the big diesel engines in Caterpillar equipment had been German-made until recently. That business now goes to a supplier in the United States: the Delco Products unit of the General Motors Corporation. ''We are constantly looking for these opportunities,'' Mr. Dryden said. **********Using this approach, Caterpillar was able to keep overall price increases for its foreign supplies last year to 10 percent, the same rate of increase for the supplies it purchased in the United States. The prices Caterpillar charges for its heavy equipment went up only 5 percent last year and barely at all in 1986 and 1987. **********''There are Japanese and American competitors out there to discipline us,'' said Donald Paris, the company's chief economist. ''People haven't realized the determination of companies to hold on to customers. That's one of the reasons for the mistake about inflation.'' **********Executives at other manufacturers tell similar stories. Steven Roberts, a purchasing executive at the Ford Motor Company, said that besides shopping around, Ford also holds down costs by developing long-term relationships with suppliers and ''working with them on pricing.'' **********Such actions help to explain why import prices have not climbed nearly as much as foreign currencies have against the dollar. **********A weighted basket of the currencies of the nations from which the United States receives most of its imports has appreciated nearly 50 percent against the dollar since March 1985. Many economists had expected that appreciation to cause import prices to jump by 35 to 40 percent - or about 10 percentage points more than they have. **********Ms. Mann of the World Bank says much more work needs to be done to understand the relationships among currency fluctuations, import prices and inflation rates. ''No one has tried to show just how changes in import product prices ultimately show up in the inflation rate,'' she said. **********The research suggested by Ms. Mann would have to deal with the wealth of anecdotal evidence not accounted for in economic theory. **********Dollar devaluation, for example, has served as a ''shield'' that has protected price increases by American manufacturers of basic materials, such as chemicals. **********A price index covering the Dow Chemical Company's various products rose by 14 percent last year - an increase that plastics manufacturers that use Dow's chemicals could not always pass along to their customers. Paul Oreffice, Dow's chairman, said the increase simply restored Dow's price index to its early 1980's level. **********That may be, but the increase became possible because the weak dollar helped make Dow a low-cost producer worldwide. This, in turn, opened up export markets and prevented foreign manufacturers from underpricing Dow at home. **********The auto industry operates behind a different sort of shield, one that is not as inflationary. The prices of American-made and imported cars have risen in lock step since 1985, as if one kept a leash on the other. The Commerce Department keeps track of actual show-room selling prices, adjusted for discounts, rebates and taxes, but excluding financing costs and trade-in allowances. **********The data show that the average price of an imported car was $15,316 last year, up 24 percent over the last four years. Although American car makers could have held the line on prices and tried to grab sales from the imports, they raised prices, too. The price of American-made cars rose an average of 25 percent during the same period, to $14,010 in 1988. ''One could argue that the devaluation and the increases in foreign car prices gave the domestic people a chance to raise their prices,'' said Clinton McCully, a Commerce Department economist. **********The impact of devaluation on prices is sometimes hard to distinguish from other factors. The price of American- and foreign-made sheet steel used in cars and appliances, for example, is now about $600 a ton in the United States, up more than 20 percent since 1985, with most of the increase occurring in the last two years. Voluntary restraint agreements limiting steel imports played a role by cutting foreign competition in the United States. Dollar devaluation also helped, by bringing American steel more into line with overseas costs. **********But in the view of Harutame Umezawa, executive vice president of Nippon Steel U.S.A., the biggest factor in the price increase has been strong worldwide demand for steel, with barely enough factory capacity to fill all the orders. Nippon Steel ships one million tons of steel to the United States a year, and if import limits were lifted, Nippon might not be able to increase this amount by very much because of short supplies in Japan, Mr. Umezawa said. **********For the past year, another sort of import barrier has had a very clear effect on the price of metal ball-bearings, used in thousands of products with moving parts. An anti-dumping action last year by the Federal Government helped to push up the price of foreign-made ball-bearings. **********Behind this shield, American manufacturers have raised pricesby 11 percent in the past year, squeezing companies like Monarch Machine Tool in Sidney, Ohio, which makes factory lathes. **********''Our margins are way, way down,'' said Robert J. Siewert, the company's chief executive. Because of stiff competition from foreign machinery manufacturers, Monarch has managed to increase the prices of its lathes by a total of only 5 percent over the past two years. **********But Mr. Siewert sees the tide turning. His overseas competitors, he says, are finally pushing up the prices of their lathes, attempting to recover more of their currency-related losses. That, in turn, will allow Monarch to raise the amount it charges for its machines, although no increases are planned yet, Mr. Siewert said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/business/business-digest-391889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The U.S. trade deficit widened sharply in October, to $10.2 billion, and imports jumped to a record, the Commerce Department reported.

Issue of Climate Change **********The conference, bringing together environment officials for two days of non-binding discussions, was called to consider the problem of climate change. Western European nations had hoped for a final declaration that would commit the participants to limiting carbon dioxide emissions to an agreed level by the year 2000.

He said he had received it from his own father who in turn had inherited it from his father before him. Its value, he said, was immense. The handle was particularly prized. And his pride went some way toward explaining why so few rhinoceroses remain in Africa. **********In this high city, rimmed by a fortress-horizon of crenelated mountains, most men, like the editor, routinely wear the characteristic curved dagger of Yemen. **********Over the years, its importance as a symbol of status and virility has been constant, and, over the centuries, a dagger-handle made of rhinoceros horn has come to be known as the superlative. Its texture and luminescence gladden the eye. Its display betokens wealth and power. The Slaughter Quickens **********In the 1970's, when many Yemenis earned big money in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom, they returned home with their unaccustomed wealth and sought to spend it on daggers with handles made of various substances including rhinoceros horn. The demand for horn skyrocketed, and the poachers of East Africa responded by slaughtering more rhinoceroses, whose horn had traditionally been sought in the Far East as a medicine and aphrodisiac. **********Since 1982, the authorities - eager to preserve an international reputation as honest dealers with the foreign powers that provide financial aid - have outlawed the importation of rhinoceros horn. Many diplomats and Yemenis say the trade has been greatly reduced. But as a Western diplomat said, ''the damage has already been done'' to the endangered rhinoceros. **********Here, in the narrow byways of the walled Old City, many men offer to sell their daggers to prospective purchasers who cluster about with keen interest. **********Few daggers that are sold openly are made of rhinoceros horn, and the price of those that are sold has risen markedly, from around $800 before the ban on imports to around $2,000.  A Trade Gone Furtive **********In 1987, Yemeni officials said, a route was uncovered stretching from Burundi to Ethiopia then on to Dubai, whence smuggled rhinoceros horn was taken across the desert by four-wheel-drive truck to Yemen's porous eastern borders. More recently, the officials said, a direct air route was discovered from Nairobi to Sana. **********Last year, conservationists from Nairobi, Kenya, reported that there was no evidence rhinoceros horn was being sold here in the souk, or market, where stores the size of newspaper kiosks cluster next to old homes that run to eight stories high in brown-beige brick and white, like gingerbread houses. **********In these same alleys, men will whisper to foreigners these days that, yes, there is rhinoceros horn, brought from Africa, aged and worked into dagger handles. But those men will not give their names or display their illegal wares. **********''It would greatly surprise me,'' a Western diplomat said, ''if some rhinoceros horn did not slip by.''  The Community Chew **********It is the men who wear the daggers here, and the men who set the social pace. **********Thus, most afternoons, after lunch, in the room of Yemeni houses known as the mafraj - the place of looking out - men will gather around a great water-pipe, passing around its hose to smoke a local tobacco as they chew the mildly narcotic leaf called qat. **********Like the demand for rhinoceros horn, the demand for qat grew rapidly in the 1970's, fueled by money earned in the rich oil-producing countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. What previously had been a weekend habit for many became a daily chew and a part of society. **********''Qat is like gasoline in a car,'' one man said at a recent qat-chewing session here. ''It powers you.'' **********Another said, ''Qat is the tree of gold.'' Quest for the Youngest Leaf **********The sessions have become a social focus, where men meet, smoke, chew, sip soft drinks and talk away from women. And qat, an amphetamine-like narcotic that is outlawed in the United States and some European countries, presents a quandary for the authorities: while its impact on Yemeni society is not always beneficial, its use is so deeply embedded that it seems politically impossible to move against it. **********When the leaf is brought from field to market in late morning, men cluster around, seeking the choicest, youngest leaf for their afternoon chew. **********The drug is said to be habit-forming, but not physically addictive in the manner of heroin or cocaine. Farming Is Distorted **********Qat has become such a profitable business that many farmers have abandoned other crops to grow the bushes. Some estimates say the farmers earn around $1.2 billion a year from the leaf. That keeps them on the land, avoiding the over-urbanization of many third world countries. **********But it also distorts agriculture. Yemen's grain imports have risen from 100,000 tons to 600,000 tons over the last decade as farmers have switched to qat. Coffee, once the staple cash crop, is down, too. And worse, the narcotic, costing around $10 for an afternoon's chew for one man, has stripped many household budgets in the cities while the farmers prosper. **********''If you are spending 70 percent of your income on qat,'' said a Westerner here, ''how are you going to feed the children?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/06/business/farmers-plan-for-a-bumper-crop.html": {"writer_name": "Dennis Blank", "pub_date": "1989-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 836, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Farmers Plan for a Bumper Crop", "print_headline": "Farmers Plan for a Bumper Crop", "body_text": " **********With crop prices high and inventories low, Jim Howe will increase his spending on wheat, barley and sugar beet seed crops by 17 percent this year in the rich Red River Valley of eastern North Dakota. **********Mr. Howe and thousands of other farmers will till more land because of last year's drought and the subsequent reduction in the number of acres that the Government will pay farmers to keep idle. The Agriculture Department estimates that farmers will receive price supports to set aside 26 million acres this year, compared with 54.2 million acres in 1988. **********As a result, the year is shaping up as a bountiful one for many businesses, including banks, equipment makers, seed and fertilizer suppliers and retailers who rely on farmers and their families. **********Farm debt will increase 12 percent, to $76 billion, by year-end, in the estimate of Stan Hargrove, an economist with Data Resources International in Minneapolis. At the same time, he expects that farm spending will jump by $11 billion, to $120 billion. Government Estimate **********The Agriculture Department is less optimistic, but still expects a healthy 5 percent increase in overall farm spending, which includes a 9 percent increase for fertilizer and 7 percent for tractors. **********To be sure, the weather is holding back some from increased spending. Because drought conditions in Kansas continue to threaten to wipe out as much as 20 percent of the winter wheat crop, farmers are cautious. **********''They are coming in, wanting to buy and pricing,'' said Roger Profitt, manager of Lyons County Implement in Lyons, Kan. But ''they aren't buying because they don't know what wheat is going to do.'' **********''Our tractor sales are down,'' he said, ''because people just don't want to spend the money, not knowing if wheat is in the bin or not.'' **********Some farmers have put off spending for new equipment for so long that they cannot wait any longer. Deere & Company, the big manufacturer of farm machinery, is optimistic that this will be the year many farmers replace equipment, especially combines, which harvest crops. Optimistic Manufacturer **********''I would say sales are going to be up a good 10 percent for us,'' said Hans W. Becherer, president and chief operating officer of Deere. ''We at Deere feel very bullish.'' **********Spending, however, is expected to keep farmers' profits down. Farm profits will decline 5 to 10 percent this year because of the increased spending and borrowing, Sung W. Son, chief economist for Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said. Other economists say it will remain flat at $53 billion. **********The Agriculture Department and private economists predict that farmers will plant 30 million more acres this year, a 10 percent increase from 1988. Another estimate is due at the end of the month. **********Carlyn Schweiger, a corn and soybean farmer in Dows, Iowa, said he is planting more of his 800 acres because the Government reduced its set-aside requirements from 20 percent of a farm's productive acreaage to 10 percent. What the Government Allows **********''You kind of do what the Government programs allow,'' he said. The Agriculture Department reduced its support payments when commodity prices rose and inventories dwindled. **********Last year's drought cut grain and corn surpluses to record lows, driving commoditiy prices up. Wheat stocks will drop from 1.2 billion bushels to a projected 534 million by June. **********The higher prices for the nation's three biggest crops - wheat, corn and soybeans - are also encouraging farmers to plant more acreage this spring. Winter wheat planting rose 22 percent last fall in Kansas. **********Borrowing from agricultural bankers is rising, said Richard Todd, an economist with the Federal Reserve in Minneapolis, because farmers have less cash as a result of the drought. Community farm banks are also in a better position to lend money because deposits have held up or increased, he said. More Borrowing **********Kelly Dakken, a banker in Drayton, N.D., said grain and sugar beet farmers will be ''borrowing more but not a lot more.'' His loan-to-deposit ratio at the Drayton State Bank has increased from 58 to 60 percent, and Mr. Dakken is expecting it to reach a peak of 76 percent by summer. **********Mr. Son of Norwest expects a gradual increase in borrowing. ''Loan demand is slowly rising but not dramatically,'' he said. ''During the summer drought, farmers cut back on spending. Confidence has returned with better cash flows.'' **********Economists say the crucial influence on farm spending between now and spring will be rainfall. Farmers in areas that remain dry, like Kansas, may be discouraged from buying new equipment for expanding acreage, economists said. **********''The weather is the big factor right now,'' Mr. Hargrove said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/10/business/briefs-513889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Allied Security Inc., Pittsburgh, said that a special committee of directors had rejected a management buyout proposal at $53 a share and that company officials were considering whether to raise the bid. *********** Bally Manufacturing Corp., Chicago, said the New Jersey Casino Control Commission had approved its proposal to refinance Bally's Park Casino Hotel, Atlantic City. *********** Buffton Corp., Fort Worth, a cable company, said it had entered into a letter of intent to sell the helix wire division of its Contex Electronics Inc. unit to NEK Cable Inc., Ronkonkoma, L.I.

In Washington, Mr. Genscher and Mr. Stoltenberg were expected to argue that the call for ''speedy'' rather than immediate talks was a compromise. But diplomats said Washington was likely to reject the argument. **********''This is a real crisis, and it's all because Kohl is losing his nerve,'' a NATO diplomat said. ''He's in total panic.'' Local Elections Cited **********The crisis began when local elections in West Berlin and Hesse State brought out a marked dissatisfaction with Mr. Kohl's Government and a strong showing by the far right and the far left. Mr. Kohl's response has been to move in the direction of least resistance. In general, that has meant leftward on foreign policy and rightward on domestic policy. **********Subsequent polls confirmed that the Chancellor was in deep trouble, and all his efforts to reverse the decline - including a major shake-up of his Government last week - have failed to turn the tide. **********The Cabinet shuffle, which included new heads in the critical Ministries of Defense, Finance and Interior, may have served only to deepen his problems by touching off another of the incessant disputes among the coalition partners - Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats, Mr. Genscher's Free Democrats and the conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria. **********Though Mr. Kohl has often had his back to the wall before and has come back fighting, the sense is unanimous in Bonn that this is his most serious crisis since he came to power at the head of a conservative-center-liberal coalition in 1982. **********Why the electorate has so abruptly turned against the Chancellor at a time of peace and prosperity remains one of Bonn's bigger mysteries. 'Power Is Oozing Away' **********''Usually, governments get punished for bad economic performance,'' said Josef Joffe, the foreign editor of the Suddeutsche newspaper. ''By that standard, what's happening is crazy. Germans have tons of leisure time, a strong mark, exports are up, there's peace, prosperity, no crime. **********''What seems to happen in German politics is a sudden feeling that power is oozing away from him,'' he said, adding, in a reference to three former Chancellors, ''It happened with Erhard in 1966, with Brandt, with Schmidt.'' **********Some members of his own party have begun openly moving away from Mr. Kohl, shaping an opposition around Lothar Spath, the Premier of Baden-Wurttemberg state, and Heiner Geissler, the general secretary of the party and a leader of its liberal wing. **********The accepted wisdom in Bonn now is that if Mr. Kohl makes a bad showing in June, his party will be tempted to jettison him in hopes of winning national elections in December 1990. And if he is still in charge then, he could well lose to a ''Red-Green'' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. Allies Are Fearful **********The notion of a ''red-green'' government remains anathema to most NATO allies - at least in Washington, London and Paris - who fear that the leftists would place insurmountable obstacles to continuation of current alliance strategies. **********In addition to his shifts on arms-control policies, Mr. Kohl has scrapped unpopular plans to extend mandatory military service from 15 to 18 months as of June and has asked the allies to sharply reduce low-level training flights in German airspace. **********The extension had been ordered to offset a decline in the number of draft-age men, and Mr. Kohl had often pointed to it as proof of his commitment to a strong defense. In abandoning the extension, the Chancellor said ''new figures'' made it no longer necessary. **********Mr. Kohl's policy shifts have hardly been limited to foreign affairs. He was scheduled to announce a full package of new policies this Thursday, and advance announcements and leaks made clear they would be extensive. **********Mr. Kohl's new Finance Minister, Theodor Waigel, was expected to scrap or sharply reduce an unpopular tax on interest income. The Government was moving toward abandoning construction of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf in Bavaria that had been fiercely opposed by environmentalists. Mr. Kohl is also expected to announced some curbs on the social benefits available to foreigners and immigrants. **********Some commentators argued, however, that Mr. Kohl's readiness to abandon policies he had once held sacrosanct was only serving to further erode his support by intensifying what could be his major problem - the image of wavering, weak and chronically quarrelsome leadership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/23/business/economic-scene-are-banks-broke-too.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1989-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 840, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Are Banks Broke, Too?", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Are Banks Broke, Too?", "body_text": " **********NOW that President Bush has signed $100 billion-plus bailout legislation for the savings and loan industry, Washington can take time out for a little self-congratulation. **********Or can it? Dan Brumbaugh of Stanford University, Andrew Carron of the First Boston Corporation and Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution believe thinly capitalized commercial banks may be in no better shape than savings and loans were five years ago. What is more, they say, the monumental effort needed to clean up the savings mess may divert regulatory talent from the banks just when it is needed most. **********Viewed from afar, commercial banking looks secure. Last year the banks reported profits of $25 billion, along with the highest return on stockholders' equity since 1974. But in an article in the latest issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, the three economists say the big picture masks serious weaknesses. **********Bank capital, the buffer that keeps banks above water in hard times, on average represents a larger proportion of bank assets than it did in 1980. But unlike the children in Lake Wobegon, not all banks are above average. **********To assess the potential for loss, the economists break down the capital ratios for some 5,300 banks with assets exceeding $50 million. In September 1988, 28 of them with assets of $22 billion were open even though they had a zero net worth. Another 48 with assets of $43 billion were hobbling along with capital ratios below 3 percent. **********These ''walking dead,'' virtually everyone acknowledges, are in deep trouble and will cost a lot to close. But the $15 billion accumulated in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation funds, plus $3.5 billion in annual premium and interest income, should be plenty to cover the loss. **********It is the next tier of potential problem banks that worries the three economists most. Some 150 banks with assets of $926 billion have capital ratios between 3 and 6 percent. Many of them are high-profile institutions: 13 of the 15 largest banks in the country, with assets of $700 billion, fit the category. And many of them have huge exposures to Latin American debts, which they have yet to write off at realistic rates. **********Few policy makers would risk the consequences of allowing any of these giant institutions to close, or any of their depositors, insured or uninsured, to lose money. How much will it cost the F.D.I.C. - or the taxpayers - to keep them open? **********Perhaps nothing. On paper, their assets exceed their liabilities, even after more plausible provisions for uncollectible third world debt. But the way banks report assets and liabilities makes it almost impossible to say for sure. **********In most cases banks are permitted to carry assets on their books at acquisition cost rather than market value, and need not show a gain or loss until an asset is sold or, in the case of a loan, in default. Thus banks that are poorly capitalized because they recorded losses in recent years probably have still greater losses buried in their books. Just this sort of legally concealed losses added tens of billions to the Government's ultimate liability when the savings and loan industry fell off a cliff. **********What might be done to assure that history does not repeat itself? A first goal, Mr. Brumbaugh argues, is for regulators to acknowledge the potential risk. While it may be difficult politically to force banks to mark their assets to market value, the regulators could and should make some reckoning of the insurance fund's potential losses. **********Another step would be to forbid banks to pay dividends that exceed the bank's reported earnings - in effect, paying dividends out of the bank's capital. Regulators are particularly reluctant to play tough in this area because they do not wish to encourage banks to conceal uncollectible debts. In 1985, for example, they permitted the Bank of America to pay a $1.16-a-share dividend on reported losses of $2.68 a share. But such forbearance could prove expensive if and when the economy turns sour and the banks' thin shell of capital is washed away in a flood of loan defaults. **********What may matter most in stemming losses before they become the taxpayers' problem, Mr. Brumbaugh argues, is regulatory vigilance. The examiners at the sleepy old Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were never a match for the sharks who infested the savings and loan industry in the early 1980's. **********Bank regulators have a better record in catching the hustlers. But they too have been less than eager to close down banks that are failing for reasons other than outright criminality. And now that the F.D.I.C. has been made responsible for both banks and savings and loans, regulators will have less time to spot the scofflaws."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/13/business/company-news-northern-telecom-technological-gain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Northern Telecom Technological Gain", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Northern Telecom Technological Gain", "body_text": " **********Northern Telecom Ltd. said it had developed a fiber-optic technology that would quadruple its current capacity.

He said he would announce the end of the cease-fire at a news conference on Saturday morning. Nov. 1 Offensive Planned **********''I have made the decision that on the 31st of October we won't renew the cease-fire,'' President Ortega said. The President said Sandinista troops ''will go on the offensive'' on Wednesday against the rebels now in Nicaragua. He estimated their number at 2,500.  But reports from north-central Nicaragua today indicated that Government troops had already begun what appeared to be a coordinated combat operation against the contras. Heavy fighting was reported.  [ Page 5. ]  ''We are facing a terrorist offensive from a counterrevolution endorsed by the UNO and financed by the United States,'' Mr. Ortega said, referring to the National Opposition Union, a coalition that is challenging the governing Sandinistas in elections set for Feb. 25. ''The contra attacks are endangering the electoral process,'' he said. ''We want to guarantee the electoral process by taking these measures.'' Arias and U.S. Surprised **********The Sandinista leader emphasized that the halt to the truce was not a precursor to pulling out of the regional accords or canceling or postponing the elections. **********The decision, which was announced in an interview with one European and two American reporters here, could be a major setback for the two-year-old Central American peace plan. **********The host President, Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the regional peace plan, criticized Mr. Ortega's decision. **********''Something like this would be lamentable,'' he said. ''The ball is in the political court, not in the military court.'' **********Officials with President Bush, who is attending the meeting here, appeared surprised by the report. **********In a press conference late this evening, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said President Ortega had made no mention of his intention to suspend the cease-fire during a three-hour meeting of the presidents today. **********''If he has made this decision, it is a bit less than honest to sit through three hours of meetings with other heads of state and not mention it,'' Mr. Baker said. ''If indeed he goes forward with this, it might be just as an excuse to deny his people a free and fair election.'' **********Mr. Baker said the United States would try to work with other leaders in the region to renew the cease-fire. He repeatedly said that the United States believed that Mr. Ortega was ending the cease-fire because the Sandinistas fear losing the February elections. **********The Arias plan required the five Central American countries that signed it in August 1987 to cease hostilities and called for the demobilization of the Nicaraguan rebels and other insurgent groups in the region. **********In response to the Arias plan, the two sides signed a cease-fire at Sapoa, Nicaragua, in March 1988. That agreement called for a halt to military operations while the two sides negotiated a permanent end to the war and put a regional peace plan into place. **********The United States continues to give the rebel army non-weapons assistance. **********The meeting here is supposed to discuss debt, deforestation, democracy, development, disarmament and drugs - the ''Six D's,'' as the topics are called by participants. But the meeting, the first in almost a quarter of a century, has been overshadowed by feuding between President Bush and President Ortega. The American delegation insisted that the meeting be largely ceremonial because it did not want to appear to be negotiating with President Ortega, diplomats here said. **********Mr. Bush is to meet with Nicaraguan opposition leaders here on Saturday morning. He vetoed plans for a final communique because of fears that the statement would provide new legitimacy to the Sandinista Government. **********In the interview in his hotel suite here, Mr. Ortega indicated that he planned to talk to President Bush. ''Obviously, when heads of state meet, it is customary that they greet one another,'' he said. **********President Ortega accused President Bush, who this month announced that he would not lift economic sanctions against Nicaragua, of trying to wreck the Government's electoral campaign by destroying the economy and supporting the contras and the opposition coalition. He also critized the opposition coalition for failing to denounce the rebel attacks. **********The decision to end the cease-fire seemed to be an attempt to focus attention on the contras. The rebels are viewed by many Latin leaders as an anachronism of a failed United States policy that has caused extraordinary suffering in the region. **********Mr. Ortega is under considerable pressure from the leaders gathered here to continue opening the Nicaraguan political process. Several observers from the United Nations and other monitoring groups, among them Elliot L. Richardson, a former Attorney General under President Nixon, have said the preliminary preparations for the February elections seem fair. Criticism From Arias **********But Mr. Arias, who carries great political weight in the region, has criticized Nicaragua's electoral laws. In his opening speech to the summit meeting, he made several thinly veiled attacks on the Nicaraguan leader. **********''We have often seen how those who led struggles against dictators themselves use the name of freedom to establish dictatorships of a different ideological view,'' Mr. Arias said. **********President Ortega said he made the decision to abandon the cease-fire after the killing of two Sandinista organizers on Wednesday and the Oct. 21 attack on two trucks carrying Sandinista reservists on their way to register to vote. Nineteen soldiers were killed and six were wounded in the ambush. **********''The army can no longer remain with its hands tied while contras operate with impunity,'' Mr. Ortega said. **********President Ortega said the contras have repeatedly violated the cease-fire, saying they had killed 736 Nicaraguans and wounded 1,153. He also blamed the rebels for the kidnapping or disappearance of 1,481 others. **********The rebels, most of whom remain in their Honduran camps receiving food and medical aid from the United States, have acknowledged sending patrols into Nicaragua. **********''We are going to guarantee the elections,'' Mr. Ortega said.

Edelman, is building a new chain that seeks a niche in overlooked towns in rural America. **********His new family restaurants, called Traditions, offer moderately priced home-style cooking for people who want to eat out but find they have little more than fast-food outlets or the proverbial greasy spoons from which to choose.  Places Like Piqua **********Mr. Office is looking to rural county seats and other small cities that he says lack what Traditions offers: a nice place with a wide-ranging menu for business lunches or for families and older adults to have Sunday dinner. The most recently decorated restaurants are attractive but not trendy, featuring burgundy carpeting, rose-colored booths, oak-rimmed Formica tables and living and silk plants, depending on the light. **********Most of the company-run restaurants are situated well away from large cities, in places like Piqua, Urbana and Van Wert, Ohio, and Blufton, Ind., the first Traditions location outside Ohio. **********Among the advantages of the new concept is a lack of direct competition from other chains, like the Bob Evans family-style restaurants, which cater mostly to larger markets. **********Daniel Lee, a restaurant analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said there were no rural chains offering both home-style cooking and an institutionally clean setting. Even so, he added, Traditions could face competition from real home cooking. ''People in rural areas are much more likely to cook at home,'' he said. **********Rural communities also offer lower real estate prices, which holds down expansion costs. And they have better labor markets than larger cities, where restaurant jobs often go begging. ''I think you can make a case that the work ethic is better'' in smaller communities, Mr. Office said. **********Mr. Office gets help in finding the best locations from community leaders in small cities that want a restaurant like Traditions. He sees a chance to build customer loyalty in small communities. But ''we still have to be reasonable'' in pricing, he said. ''People are more value conscious.'' **********The idea is good, solid, simple food for people who could be described the same way. At a Traditions near Dayton, spaghetti is $4.49, barbecued chicken is $5.59, Swiss steak is $5.69 and top sirloin steak, one of the most expensive items, is $6.49. Soup and a salad add $1.10, and a customer leaves with the feeling that while it may not have been the world's greatest, he got his money's worth. **********Traditions seeks to deliver a personal touch by sponsoring Little League baseball teams and other community activities, and through special features like birthday discounts of 1 percent for each year of a customer's age. ''If you were 110 years old, we would gladly give you 10 percent back,'' Mr. Office said.  No Scotch and Meatloaf **********The new chain shuns liquor, a profitable staple of many restaurants, because Mr. Office said it does not fit in with the customers he is seeking or with his menu. ''Meatloaf, mashed potatoes and Scotch and water doesn't work very well together,'' he said. **********The new venture offers a major change for the 47-year-old executive, who joined the Ponderosa as its chairman in 1968, when the company was three years old and he was 27. At that time, he had practiced law briefly, and served as a management trainee at Chemical Bank in New York. **********By the time Mr. Edelman's unwanted attention arrived, Ponderosa's holdings included more than 600 steakhouses, a chain of Mexican restaurants called Casa Lupita, a meat-processing operation and a multimillion-dollar corporate art collection. Corporate offices were split between Dayton's downtown and a sleek glass structure at the airport. **********In early 1987, Mr. Edelman prevailed, and soon set about dismantling much of what Mr. Office had built. The meat processor was sold, as were the Mexican restaurants and the art collection. Mr. Edelman sold the steakhouses in early 1988 to the Metromedia Company, the current operator.  Growth Course Set **********Mr. Office left with $6 million when the new owner bought out his long-term employment contract. While financially secure, he hated being idle, and in mid-1988 acquired the Empire family restaurant chain - a 10-restaurant company based in Celina, Ohio. **********Mr. Office moved the company to Moraine, a Dayton suburb, changed the restaurant name to Traditions and set it on a growth course. By the end of the year, he said, he will have nearly doubled the chain's size to 19 outlets through a building and acquisition program, and he foresees 50 restaurants within five years. He expects the privately held company, Jerry Office Inc., to move into the black this year, and said he might eventually take it public. For the time being, however, with no stockholders to answer to, he says, ''I guess it's a matter of how big I want it to be.'' **********Mr. Office is able to get out to at least one of his restaurants almost every day. And he acts as the company's spokesman in television advertisements, done with a very folksy pitch. **********''It's very similar to what Ponderosa was when it was small,'' he said. ''To be active in all phases of the business is more fun than to try to orchestrate a large organization.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/03/world/leaders-in-west-bank-called-to-meet-israeli.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leaders in West Bank Called to Meet Israeli", "print_headline": "Leaders in West Bank Called to Meet Israeli", "body_text": " **********Israeli occupation authorities in the West Bank summoned leading Palestinian figures to a meeting today, and the Palestinians said they had been forced to attend. **********The Israeli officials said that the head of the West Bank civil administration, Brig.

South Korean fishermen, operating far from their shores, have used such nets in the Mediterranean, as well as the Pacific. **********Scientists and Coast Guard officials say the new technology - which is intended to catch more tuna and swordfish - is causing havoc throughout the western Mediterranean by threatening many other marine animals. There are also accusations that the boatmen are ''strip mining'' fishing grounds. Affects Vessels, Too **********This summer, the officials added, the vast drift nets have also disrupted navigation in the busy Mediterranean waters off France, Italy and Spain. The nets have forced boatmen to make large detours, and because they are often poorly marked, they have damaged outboard motors and endangered smaller craft. **********Along the same coasts in France and Italy, scientists in the last two years have recorded more than 200 dead whales and dolphins showing net markings and with their fins, flippers and tails slashed. Turtles have been found with amputated front legs. The fishermen mutilate the animals, dead or alive, to untangle them from the nylon filaments, French and Italian Coast Guard officials said. Diplomatic Clashes **********''This slaughter is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Giuseppe Notarbartolo, who belongs to a network of marine zoologists monitoring the animal strandings in Italy. ''We could count only the animals that did not sink.'' **********The drift-net technology has caused confrontations between the United States and the Asian users - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Washington has threatened the three Asian nations with trade sanctions, charging that their drift-net operations seriously threaten marine life and deplete stocks of American salmon. Agreements have just been concluded with Japan and Taiwan, but South Korea still faces a possible boycott of all its fish exports to the United States. **********In the Mediterranean, scientists assert that the huge nets compound the threats to a fragile sea already strained by large coastal populations, pollution and dwindling fish supplies. **********At least 200 vessels are now believed to use drift nets in the western part of the sea. Coast Guard officials in France and Italy said they did not know the number of vessels from South Korea, but its flotilla operating from the Canary Islands has been using drift nets off the Mediterranean coast of Africa, near Malta. Spanish and Italian vessels with drift nets ply the waters roughly south of France. **********''There is nothing we can do,'' an official at a coast guard station in France said. ''They are in international waters.'' Different Types of Nets **********The fishermen from Spain and Italy argue that the new nets permit them to work with small crews yet multiply their catch almost 10 times. Many have bought the nets in the last six years with the help of government and European Community subsidies. Loans came easily as an incentive to switch from ''bottom trawling'' with nets regarded as destructive because they swoop up all species from the bottom of the sea. **********A battle is now under way between scientists and environmentalists who want the new drift nets banned and fishermen who say their accidental catch of mammals is small. **********''Dolphins blunder into the nets because their sonar does not sense the nylon filaments,'' said William Perrin, a specialist in whales and dolphins. Turtles get the nylon mesh wrapped around their legs, he said, while whales get their fins and tails entangled. If these air-breathing species cannot surface for air, they drown. **********Experts say they do not know how many in the family of sea mammals called cetaceans - whales, dolphins and porpoises - are left in the Mediterranean. Striped and bottlenose dolphins are still common but sightings of sperm whales, pilot whales and goose-beaked whales have become rarer in recent years. But How Rare? ''Because it is not known how many of these animals there are, we don't know how long they can sustain this catch,'' said Mr. Perrin, who is chairman of the cetacean group of the World Conservation Union. Most such animals, he said, ''get only one calf at a time, once every few years, so it is easy to deplete them.'' **********In Spain, almost 25 vessels have licenses for the vast drift nets. The Government has stopped issuing new permits after protests about unfair competition from other fishermen. **********Italy has licensed several hundred boats that fan out from ports near San Remo, in the north, to Messina and Catania, in Sicily. A spokesman at the Merchant Marine Ministry said the exact number is not known because the Italian licensing system has no separate category for such nets. He said the ministry would investigate the existing licenses and not issue any new ones. **********''We have urged the Government to put observers on board of those vessels, but no one makes the effort,'' said Dr. Notarbartolo, who heads the Tethys Institute in Milan, a marine research group. Fishermen Counterattack **********Italian fishermen seem determined to fight. Stung by environmentalists' complaints about dead dolphins and whales, some boats based in northern Italy have reportedly taken rocks aboard to tie them to carcasses, making sure that they do not drift or wash ashore. **********In San Remo, port officials said they had received anonymous death threats after protesting that the vast nets were a navigational hazard in the busy waters off Corsica. Last month, more than 10 accidents involved commercial boats and yachts, and some with broken propellers have had to be towed ashore both in Italy and France. **********Scientists from several European countries meeting in Rome last month said they would demand that the European Community ban the nets and seek an agreement with Mediterranean nations outside the Community. **********''The Mediterranean already has a highly impoverished fauna because of overexploitation and abuse,'' Mr. Perrin said. ''With those nets, we will see a cleanout of what is left.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/world/kazan-journal-street-gangs-return-and-soviet-city-is-chagrined.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1989-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kazan Journal; Street Gangs Return, and Soviet City Is Chagrined", "print_headline": "Kazan Journal; Street Gangs Return, and Soviet City Is Chagrined", "body_text": " **********Ten years ago, at the height of citizens' panic over the rise of teen-age gang wars in this ancient city on the Volga, the most notorious of the gang leaders, Zavdat Khantimirov, was executed for banditry before a firing squad. **********He was grimly mourned by his minions in the Tyap-Lyap gang who faced long prison terms. State authority, a granite-hard resource in the Soviet Union, was thought to have once again solved a problem with the rigid approach that so often worked before. **********A decade later, however, the ghosts of the Tyap-Lyaps are thriving unto a new generation, with dozens of gangs aggressively vying to establish neighborhood fiefs and scarring this charming provincial city with what has become known nationally as ''the Kazan phenomenon.'' **********This time, as the gangs again indulge their ''turf'' fights with chains and iron bars, a radically different reaction - a mix of temperate countermeasures and fervid guilt - can be discerned among the city's adult authorities. 'Our Own Mirror' **********''We are responsible because the young people are our own mirror, reflecting our values,'' said Savely O. Tesis, the region's top police expert on the problem, analyzing the phenomenon in which thousands of rural families have fled the farm for the city. **********They have wound up in drab apartment warrens devoid of all social amenities, with their young disassociated but soon swaggering in self-identity in such gangs as Mud, Fox Yard, The Finnish and The New Tatars, the latter referring not to an ethnic gang but to a traditional neighborhood where Russian and Tatar youths are cohorts. **********''Unfortunately very few adults understand that the young generation not only hears what we say but also watches what we do, and they underline the contrast between the two,'' said Mr. Tesis, the deputy chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Tatar Autonomous Republic. He talks of rampant divorce, of ''morally damaged'' families and increasing economic pressures. **********This focus on hypocrisy - on the contrast between the elders' preaching ideals to the young while surviving under the mendacious role models of past regimes, now officially rebuked - has added a new fervor to a complicated social issue that has attracted national attention to this city 600 miles east of Moscow. Revised Constitution Sought **********On one level, this may only be a new form of an old habit, the need to echo the ultimate authority figure, in this case President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his denunciation of the ''stagnation'' and ''corruption'' of his predecessors. **********The local newspaper, in tune with the openness fostered by Mr. Gorbachev, has headlined a problem previously buried and thereby prompted a debate. Some worried residents would resort anew to capital punishment. But there are many others who argue that a new weapon is at hand in the government overhaul under way in the nation. **********In a way, this debate reflects the effect of mr. Gorbachev's oratory as local politicians, competitively elected for the first time, feel responsible for suggesting solutions to problems and happily invoke his program of perestroika, or restructuring. **********''We must first adopt a firm, independent constitution if we are to make progress on problems such as this,'' said Andrei P. Gavrilov, a local member of the Congress of People's Deputies who spent his inaugural session in Moscow in June fighting to include the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights as the basis for rewriting the Soviet Constitution. He is in no mood to apologize for his idealism in facing such a complex problem, which bedevils assorted law-rooted societies. **********''I said if we don't do that, we have no right to be called a law-based state,'' said Mr. Gavrilov, apparently surprised that his proposal has thus far scraped through with marginal approval in the preliminary vote of a legislative commission. #14 Die in Gang Wars Mr. Gavrilov, the editor of the local paper, Vechernyaya Kazan, concedes that the far more basic fight, ''the true transfer of government power,'' lies ahead, with difficult issues like creation of an independent judiciary far from being broached by the new congress. But for him, a constitution that the ordinary citizen can find trustworthy is the key to tackling basic social problems like the gang wars in which 14 young men have been killed here in four years. **********They are casualties in neighborhood beatings and vendettas among more than 60 gangs averaging about 100 members each in this city of one million people, according to the statistics of Deputy Chief Tesis. He carefully noted as well that 15 percent of the nation survives below the official poverty level. ''This is all an endless spiral,'' he said. **********The absence of hard-core drug use and of liberally available firearms has kept the problem on a scale that the police in many Western nations might not find alarming. But for this family-oriented, authority-rooted society, the gangs of Kazan are a puzzling specter, the more so since their structures are becoming more sophisticated and more attractive than the official offerings to the young, the party-steeped Young Pioneers and Komsomol. 'A Life of Fraud' **********Some readers have accused the newspaper of overstating the gang problem. But the chief reporter on the subject, Lyubov V. Ageyeva, said this is a reaction against the increasing acknowledgment of social problems in detail. **********''The last gang wars, in the 70's, involved a few privileged children of local party leaders, and that meant the newspaper did not get involved in covering it,'' she said, adding that the latest gang members are known not for any prominent family connections, but for the higher degree of organization they enforce. Far from being excoriated by the national press for the ''Kazan phenomenon,'' she feels this city is leading the way for other rapidly changing urban areas to admit to similar problems once they resolve to look honestly at life. **********''This business of saying we're all good dedicated Communists at work, then living a life of fraud at home, must end,'' Mr. Gavrilov said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/25/world/lebanese-muslims-shell-foes-port.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1989-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanese Muslims Shell Foes' Port", "print_headline": "Lebanese Muslims Shell Foes' Port", "body_text": " **********Syrian-backed Muslim forces shelled Junieh, the main Christian seaport, today as a flotilla of French ships took up positions off the Lebanese coast. **********The command of the Muslim section of the national army said in a communique that its gunners had fired at a ''naval target'' that was steaming toward Junieh, which is 13 miles north of Beirut.

There has been volatility, but most of it has been on the up side. **********Certainly, stock prices have risen during the period. The Standard & Poor's 500 index has nearly tripled since April 21, 1982, when futures contracts on the index were introduced. It would be absurd to say that futures are the principal reason, but they have made it easier and cheaper to speculate on a rising stock market. Through index arbitrage, the bets of speculators have been translated into purchases of shares in companies like I.B.M. and General Motors. **********The mechanism is fairly simple. A speculator buys a futures contract on the S.&P. 500 contract, or perhaps a call option on such a future. He puts up less than 10 percent of the value in either case, getting the big leverage that comes from low margins. If there is no speculator willing to take the opposite side of that trade, and often there is not, an arbitrager steps in. He then covers his risk by buying the stocks in the index. **********Years ago, a speculator seeking the most bang for his buck would buy a speculative over-the-counter stock, hoping it would rise more than other stocks in a bull market. Later, the speculator moved to options on individual stocks. But since the advent of stock index futures, both of those markets have been, if not moribund, a shadow of their former selves. Year after year, the big stocks that are subject to index arbitrage have risen further than other stocks, propelled in part by the buying of program traders. **********No statistics are available on just how much buying there has been. The New York Stock Exchange has provided figures only on the number of shares traded by program traders. It knows how many were bought and how many sold, but it has refused to release the information. Last week, John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, said ''all information'' on program trading would now be disclosed, but he did not elaborate. **********After seven years of program trading, stock prices are not cheap by any standard. Such valuation measures as the price-earnings ratio and the level of dividends show a market that is historically slightly higher priced than average, while the ratio of stock prices to book value is near historic highs. If program trading were a sinister force that ''reduces stock prices,'' as Neuberger & Berman, a money manager, claimed in full-page ads a week ago, one would hardly expect such levels. **********But if program traders have not depressed prices, it is probably true that the innovations of the 1980's have stimulated volatility. Statistics on the standard deviation of daily moves in the Dow Jones industrial average for each five-year period starting in 1920 shows that the last five years have been the most volatile since the early 1930's. But none of the earlier periods have seen the Dow more than double, as it has since the end of 1984. **********Of course, when people decry volatility, they are not referring to price rises, only to declines. The rules announced by the New York Stock Exchange last week apply only when prices are falling, not rising. Rules at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the S.&P. 500 futures are traded, temporarily stop trading when prices fall as little as 1.5 percent, but on the upside come into play after a gain of 9 percent. **********What has angered many portfolio managers about index arbitrage is that its practitioners care only about the relative prices of stocks and futures, not the absolute ones. If they sell stocks at ridiculously low prices, that is fine, so long as they are able to buy futures at even lower levels. If is frustrating for a money manager to buy a stock only to see program traders drive it down. Conspiracy theories are easily bred in such circumstances. **********A program trader who sells stocks at unreasonably low prices, of course, creates buying opportunities. One focus of reforms has been to let those opportunities be exploited. By moving the expiration of the most important futures to the morning, rather than the afternoon, and advertising the order imbalances they create, the Big Board reduces the volatility created by expirations of contracts, the once-feared ''triple witching hours.'' **********The proposed Big Board rules announced last week are aimed at making it easy to advertise imbalances at any time, drawing in bargain hunters to take the opposite side of the trade from the program trader and reducing the price movements caused by that trading. **********Paradoxically, by intimidating brokerage firms and big institutional investors out of doing index arbitrage, one result of the Big Board changes may be to make spreads between the stock market and the stock index futures market both wider and more volatile. Those willing to risk public censure would then find index arbitrage more profitable than ever. If they cannot use Big Board computers to deliver the orders, they can use floor brokers. **********Someday, inevitably, stock prices will fall and keep falling. Bear markets happen, some steep and fast, some slow and prolonged. The speculators who put up low margins to bet on rising prices, via futures and options, will be forced to sell, and index arbitrage traders will in turn sell the stocks they bought in response to the speculators. **********In the current mood of Washington and Wall Street, some program trader will be named the villain. Perhaps, if the bear market lasts long enough, stock index futures will be abolished. That will make the bear market no less painful, and probably will not hasten its end. But it will fill the public need to find a scapegoat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/world/convictions-of-5-apartheid-foes-voided.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1989-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Convictions of 5 Apartheid Foes Voided", "print_headline": "Convictions of 5 Apartheid Foes Voided", "body_text": " **********In a stunning psychological victory for the anti-apartheid movement, South Africa's highest court today reversed the convictions of five blacks who were found guilty of treason or terrorism last year after the longest political trial here in recent memory. **********A five-judge panel of the Appeal Court, including the nation's Chief Justice, Michael M.

But the Government is not expected to prosecute them again, not only because of the expense but also because of the controversy generated by the original trial and the climate of increased tolerance ushered in by President F. W. de Klerk. **********Mr. de Klerk met on Wednesday with Nelson Mandela, who remains the country's most prominent political prisoner, and there is speculation that he could say something in a speech on Saturday about Mr. Mandela's own eventual release. **********''We do not feel bitter,'' Mr. Lekota told reporters in Cape Town after their release. ''We feel it is unfortunate that the last four-and-a-half years have been lost to us.'' **********He said the men would resume their struggle against apartheid. ''We hope we will be given the opportunity soon to put our shoulders to the wheel and advance,'' Mr. Lekota said. His remarks were circulated by the South African Press Association. **********They were convicted on Nov. 18, 1988, after Justice Kees van Dijkhorst accepted the state's contention that speeches and demonstrations could involve treasonable activity. **********The charges resulted from protests that erupted among residents of four black townships in the south of Transvaal province in September 1984, a time when unrest was spreading across South Africa over a new Constitution that left the country's black majority without political rights. March Ended in Violence **********A march called by the Vaal Civic Association, an affiliate of the United Democratic Front, to protest high rents degenerated into mob violence that ended in the lynching of four black municipal officials as well as looting and attacks on municipal property before the police and army moved in to restore order. Twenty-six people died in the unrest and 300 were injured. **********In all, 22 defendants were put on trial simultaneously in the Transvaal town of Delmas, but 3 were excused for lack of evidence and another 8 were later acquitted. Of the remaining 11, 4 were imprisoned on a treason conviction and one on a terrorism conviction. The six others, who joined in the appeal that was successful today, were given suspended sentences for terrorism. **********The prosecution in the so-called Delmas trial, which opened on Oct. 16, 1985, did not accuse the defendants of engaging specifically in violence, but contended that by their words and actions in encouraging demonstrations they had created a climate in which violence occurred. **********Justice van Dijkhorst accepted this argument. He ruled that ''one can commit high treason without violence'' and cited the example of espionage. **********The judge also accused the United Democratic Front of being a front for the African National Congress, which the Government banned in 1960, and said Mr. Molefe, Mr. Lekota and Mr. Chikane were the ''conspiratorial core inside the U.D.F. apple.'' They were in jail since their arrest in April 1985. **********During the trial, Justice van Dijkhorst dismissed one of the two lay assessors, or experts, who sat on the bench with him to hear and discuss the case. He said the assessor, W.A. Joubert, could not be impartial because he had once signed a petition supported by the United Democratic Front that was critical of the Constititution for failing to give blacks a political voice. The judge did not challenge the political views of his other assessor, W.F. Krugel, who was reported to belong to the Broederbond, a secret society that espouses Afrikaner supremacy. Appeal Court Agrees **********The defense lawyers used this dismissal to throw the judge's impartiality into doubt. They said the dismissal was unlawful because the law stated that an assessor could be removed only if he became physically or mentally incapacitated and because Mr. Joubert, a law professor, was never given the chance to explain his actions. The Appeal Court agreed that Mr. Joubert should not have been removed. **********In an affidavit, Mr. Joubert said that before his dismissal, Justice van Dijkhorst had bet him a bottle of whisky that none of the defendants would dare testify in their own defense. Several, including Mr. Lekota, subsequently did. Mr. Joubert cited the incident to show that the judge had assumed that the defendants were guilty before he had heard all the evidence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/20/business/earnings-off-at-genentech.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Earnings Off At Genentech", "print_headline": "Earnings Off At Genentech", "body_text": " **********Genentech Inc. today reported lower earnings for the first quarter, which it attributed to increased expenses for marketing and for research and development.

''Why can't we have that in America?'' they ask. My answer is: Because it's an outrageous boondoggle. With one possible exception, no high-speed rail system in this country could pay for itself, and the claimed external benefits - cleaner air, energy saved, eased pressure on airports - are nonexistent.'' **********The top speed from Paris to Lyons on the T.G.V. is 170 miles per hour; on the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata corridor it is 131 m.p.h. It is very costly to achieve these speeds. The line must be electrified, and the track must be almost straight and almost flat. Other than the New York-Washington line, on which electric Metroliners now run at 120 to 125 m.p.h. top, there is no track - at least no track serving a populous corridor - that meets the curve and grade standards for high-speed rail. With that exception, new, electrified right of way is an absolute prerequisite for high-speed rail. **********In a recent article in ''Technology Review,'' Louis Thompson, formerly in charge of rail passenger service at the Department of Transportation, observed that any investment estimate of less than $10 million to $20 million per mile for a new high-speed rail system is not credible. Jane Holt, a tranportation analyst, has concluded that a high-speed rail system in the United States would need 25 million riders a year to pay a 10 percent return on capital invested. **********So far, there are only two-high speed rail systems in the world with enough revenue to cover operating and capital cost: the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata Shinkansen and the Paris-Lyons T.G.V. Annual ridership on Tokyo-Hakata is around 150 million. For Paris-Lyons it is about 17 million a year. The most heavily traveled inter-city corridor in America is New York-Washington, with a combined total of airline and Metroliner passengers of only 4.3 million a year. **********Cleaner air and energy savings are the external benefits most often cited for subsidizing high-speed rail. Let us look at them. First, electric trains, unless they draw from nuclear or hydroelectric power plants, burn fossil fuels. They burn less of it per seat-mile than cars or airplanes do, but the question is whether high-speed rail results in enough fewer cars or airplanes moving around to make a difference. Even heavy patronage of a high-speed rail system can increase fossil fuel use, if its effect is increased total travel without reducing car or air travel. Further, any effect would be very small, because the proportion of total travel that could take place on trains is tiny. In 1984, cars accounted for 91 percent of travel, planes for 8 percent and trains (including commuting) for just 0.2 percent. **********Two other points that are often mentioned as pluses for high-speed rail are airport congestion and inner-city revival. The latter stems from the notion that a new train station downtown with lots of travelers coming and going will do a lot for a run-down neighborhood. Perhaps it will, but there are a lot of true stories of downtown comebacks in this country that happened without a few billion dollars being thrown at a public works project out in the countryside. **********Realistically, the only airports that could be affected by high-speed rail are La Guardia in New York and Washington National. Since travel between these two cannot account for a very large percentage of total operations at either airport, the impact of high-speed rail might not be very great even if you eliminated all La Guardia-National flights. Further, as long as small planes with a few people on board are using airspace that could be used by big planes with a lot of people on board, and that is the case today, those airports are not being used to maximum efficiency. If they were being so used, and if the demand for landing rights drove short-haul air fares higher, then there might be a market for high-speed rail on the New York-Washington line. **********USING Ms. Holt's method of analysis on the New York-Washington corridor provides for interesting results. If the one-way train fare were $150 - 50 percent higher than the cost of Pan Am's air shuttle - high-speed rail is feasible with a yearly ridership of 5.8 million people. But 5.8 million people is a one-third increase over the current number of both Metroliner riders and air travelers. So if almost all New York-Washington air travelers switched to high-speed rail and there were growth in the market, this level of ridership might be attained. And if those conditions were met, maybe the economics would work.  If people have a high-speed rail project somewhere else in the country and they think they can recover its costs and offer a decent return on capital, let them raise the money for it. But if they say a little help from government is needed, beware. Someone is reaching for your wallet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/world/olive-branch-in-the-ukraine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olive Branch in the Ukraine", "print_headline": "Olive Branch in the Ukraine", "body_text": " **********The Ukraine's new Communist chief has offered to curb harassment of nationalists, provided that they do not advocate secession.

But judging from the slowdown in the number of new catalogue shoppers, the market appears to be reaching the saturation point.

Earlier in the decade, shopper numbers were growing by more than 12 percent a year. **********A gush of catalogues may have caused the market to clog. Last year, retailers mailed 12.4 billion of them, more than double the number in 1980, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group. That is 50 catalogues for every man, woman and child in America. And competition is only one threat to retailers. State tax laws are another. Although catalogue retailers have historically been exempt from paying sales tax because most of their orders came from out of state, some 20 revenue-hungry states have adopted laws to collect them from mail order houses. Collecting the tax will add to the overhead of of retailers - especially small ones - not to mention testing the loyalties of customers. **********Retailers' costs of prospecting for new customers also have risen. In April 1988, the Postal Service increased third- and fourth-class postal rates, which affect catalogues, by as much as 30 percent. That makes it less cost effective for retailers to mail to one million households in hopes of getting orders from 2 percent of them. **********To cope, many retailers are trying to cut costs. Many have abandoned the scattershot approach to prospecting and are narrowing their mailing lists to those most likely to place orders. To identify those prospects, they are relying on a new army of data base marketers and list brokers to develop sophisticated mathematical computer models for sorting demographic and other data. **********To distinguish themselves from rivals and to weld customer loyalties, catalogue houses have become more service conscious. Many catalogues now include editorial matter. And armed with demographic data, some companies have developed separate editions for special audiences. For instance, rather than offer just one, L.L. Bean Inc. now mails 22 catalogues on subjects as narrow as fly fishing to accommodate the special interests of its customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/14/business/accord-reached-to-acquire-national-enquirer-publisher.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1989-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 438, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accord Reached to Acquire National Enquirer Publisher", "print_headline": "Accord Reached to Acquire National Enquirer Publisher", "body_text": " **********Macfadden Holdings, a private publishing company, and Boston Ventures, an investment firm, yesterday won an auction to buy GP Group Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, for $412.5 million. **********Six other bidders had made offers, including Maxwell Communications and Hachette Publications, both of which have been aggressively building their American operations. **********The National Enquirer is a weekly tabloid newspaper sold primarily at supermarket checkout counters.

In an agreement reached last week, its subsidiary Penguin USA will acquire W. H. Smith Publishers, the second-largest bargain book company. **********Bertelsmann A.G., the West German publisher, entered the bargain book field last summer through its Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group when it created the BDD Promotional Book Company. And Advance Publications Inc. acquired the Outlet Book Company, the leading supplier of bargain books, when its Random House unit bought Crown Publishers in August 1988. **********''What is happening in our industry is very much mirroring what's going on in trade publishing,'' said Caryn Malitzky, associate publisher of Outlet, referring to the consolidation throughout book publishing. A Profitable Area **********Remainders are new hard-cover books that publishers offer to bargain-book companies for a fraction of their original cost. For example, a publisher may print 100,000 copies of a title and sell 75,000, leaving it with a remainder of 25,000. Promotional books are those published by bargain book sellers. They may be bought from independent producers (called packagers) or created by bargain book concerns themselves, often using material in the public domain and printed on cheaper paper. **********Both are found in the bargain bins of bookstores, drugstores and supermarkets, priced anywhere from 50 cents for a once-popular novel to $50 for a lavishly illustrated art book. ''They are very important to booksellers because they generally carry a higher margin of profit than newly published books,'' said Bernard E. Rath, executive director of the 7,000-member American Booksellers Association. At some stores, bargain books are said to account for as much as 15 percent of annual sales. **********Outlet, begun in 1933, controls about 50 percent of an industry estimated at about $1 billion a year at retail - and growing. W. H. Smith, with some 4,500 titles in its inventory, was started 11 years ago by the W. H. Smith Group of Britain. Smith should benefit from the expertise and deep pockets of Pearson, which in this country owns Penguin, Viking, New American Library and E. P. Dutton. 'It's All-Out Combat' **********''It's all-out combat,'' said Stephen H. Weitzen, president and publisher of BDD Promotional Book Company, which publishes under the Mallard Press imprint. ''In the same way that Bantam, Random House, Simon & Schuster and Viking compete for books, we compete just as fiercely for remainders.'' **********Traditionally, book publishers invite the promotional book companies two or three times a year to bid on their unsold and overstocked titles, in lots consisting of several hundred to several hundred thousand copies. Among the authors whose books are available at bargain prices are Stephen King, Danielle Steel, Andrew Greeley, Dick Francis, Jackie Collins, Leo Buscaglia, Jack Higgins and Louis L'Amour. **********Now, though, industry observers say the most desirable remainders are likely to remain within the corporate family. **********''We may have just bought our last Stephen King remainder,'' said Ms. Malitzky of Outlet, alluding to the fact that the superstar author, who is published by Viking and New American Library, belongs to the same corporate family that is acquiring W. H. Smith. By the same token, Outlet could well benefit from its corporate links to Random House, Alfred A. Knopf, Pantheon and Crown, while Mallard Press could gain from its ties to Bantam, Doubleday and Dell."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/world/american-gets-un-post.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Gets U.N.

Then he turned his semiautomatic hunting rifle on himself. **********A three-page suicide note found on the body of the gunman, Marc Lepine, along with information provided later by the police, offered a picture of a man who felt he had failed at virtually everything, from getting into graduate school to falling in love - and blamed women for it. **********Apart from the public shock, anger and grief expressed in candlelight vigils and lowered flags across the nation, there is also a sense of shame here over the crime: a realization that the nation may not, as many Canadians had long supposed, be somehow less vulnerable to such horrors than its neighbors in the United States. 'A Kick in the Teeth' **********''This thing has been a real kick in the teeth for sanctimonious types like me,'' said Prof. Elliott Leyton of Memorial University in Newfoundland, an anthropologist who has studied mass and serial killers. ''It shows we've fully entered the modern era and no longer have anything to be smug about.'' **********''When I first heard about it, I thought I was listening to something that had happened in California or New York,'' said Yuri Dayan, a cab driver who moved to Montreal from Israel 21 years ago. ''I thought, 'It's crazy - this isn't supposed to happen in Canada.' '' **********There has been a rush of speculation on the workings of the gunman's mind, on whether Montreal's overburdened hospitals have the counseling resources to help avert such acts, and about the effectiveness of Canada's already strict gun-control laws. The gunman was able to purchase his American-made rifle in Montreal legally a few weeks earlier because he had no criminal record. Violence Against Women **********Mostly, however, the incident has focused attention on the issue of sexism and violence against women. **********Some people, including many feminist groups, have characterized the shootings as an extreme version of a kind of male hatred that they believe has contributed to rapes, beatings and other forms of abuse of women. **********''I think it's dangerous to treat this as an isolated incident,'' said Etoile Stewart, a member of the Concordia University Women's Collective, one of several student groups that sponsored a vigil at the murder scene on Thursday night. ''There are still men beating women, raping women, knifing women. Unfortunately, we live in a society where misogyny is encouraged.'' **********Several women students, including some who survived the massacre at the University of Montreal's engineering school, said they feared that such a mass assault could happen again -and that women studying in fields traditionally dominated by men, like engineering, could be more vulnerable. 'So Frightened, So Angry' **********''Women everywhere were so frightened and so angry,'' said Jocelyne Cottier, the coordinator of the Concordia University Women's Center, a university-sponsored group that offers counseling and organizes discussion groups on women's issues. **********Margaret Atwood, a Canadian novelist who has explored women's issues in her work, said that the killings of the 14 women, who ranged in age from 21 to 31, ''clearly touched many people.'' But she said she hesitated to make direct comparisons with violence in the United States or Britain. **********''Every society has its craziness, which takes different forms,'' she said from her home in Toronto. ''Every incident is culture-specific.'' **********There was no indication that Mr. Lepine had used drugs or alcohol, the police said. He shared a large apartment with his mother, a sister and a male roommate. His suicide note, written in French, included an apparent enemies list of 15 prominent Quebec women, one of whom was said to be a provincial cabinet minister. Typical but Atypical **********Detectives, noting that Mr. Lepine had unsuccessfully applied for admission to the University of Montreal engineering school, said he may have been enraged that women were accepted into traditionally male fields while he was not. **********Professor Leyton, author of the 1986 book, ''Hunting Humans: The Rise of the Modern Multiple Murderer,'' said that the gunman seemed superficially to fit the classic profile: a frustrated, lonely person from a conventional background who takes out all his aggressions in one suicidal assault. **********But Professor Leyton said there was a striking difference in the Montreal shooting. **********''This is one of the very few mass murder cases I know of in which women were specifically targeted,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/business/company-news-pernod-is-allowed-to-sell-coca-cola.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pernod Is Allowed To Sell Coca-Cola", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pernod Is Allowed To Sell Coca-Cola", "body_text": " **********A Paris court has ruled that Pernod-Ricard S.A. would temporarily be allowed to continue to produce and sell canned drinks of the Coca-Cola Company in France, Pernod said.

Group/Factoring, however, is not making any change in its policy of granting credit to Campeau suppliers ''because there is no need to do so at this time,'' its president, Frank Basile, said. **********After extending credit to its clients who supply Campeau to cover the Christmas and early spring periods, Mr. Basile said that the present period was ''a hiatus in shipping goods so that we have some time to think about'' the Campeau situation. He said that it would be mid-January before they reached a decision. **********How much of Campeau's total merchandise either the Heller or C.I.T. clients supply could not be determined, but it is believed to be several million dollars worth. The clients of both companies supply clothing, household textiles, toys, carpets, shoes and electronics. **********It is highly unlikely, however, that the Heller action will have any adverse effect on Christmas season stocks at the Campeau stores, since the vast bulk of those goods are already in the stores or on order. Big Cash Squeeze **********Campeau is experiencing its biggest cash squeeze yet since it borrowed heavily to acquire Federated for $6.6 billion in May 1988. That was less than two years after it bought Allied Stores for $3.6 billion. In September, Robert Campeau, chairman of the Toronto-based developer, resolved a cash shortage with a loan from Olympia & York Ltd., another Canadian developer, that required Mr. Campeau to yield some of his control in the corporation. **********Also in September, the company put Bloomingdale's up for sale in an effort to raise cash. It hopes to complete a deal in February. **********In addition to Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus in New York, Federated operates Burdines in Florida, Lazarus in the Midwest and Rich's in Atlanta. Allied owns Jordan Marsh in Boston and Miami, Maas Brothers in Florida, Stern's in New Jersey and Bon Marche in Seattle. **********Heller clients who decide to continue shipping to the 130 Federated/Allied stores in this country must now make new credit arrangements with another factoring company or a commercial bank; ship without credit support, or cut down or cancel new merchandise shipments. 'Pleased by the Support' **********Carol Sanger, Campeau's vice president for public relations, said in Cincinnati, where Allied and Federated are based: ''We realize that in this situation companies will have to make decisions in their own interest. But we have been very pleased by the support from suppliers and factors that we have received in the last few days.'' **********Liz Claiborne Inc., one of the Campeau stores' largest apparel suppliers, said yesterday that it had taken a number of steps in light of the current retail situation. Asked to elaborate, Samuel Miller, Claiborne's chief financial officer, said, ''We have taken action to protect our profit-loss statement from major write-offs due to the current industry problems.'' While he did not specifically cite the Campeau situation, it was most likely the main element prompting the action. **********The Federated/Allied statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which also raised the possibility of a cash squeeze in mid-March or as early as late January, produced considerable concern yesterday in the apparel supplying markets. **********Kenneth Sitomer, president of Russ Togs Inc., also a large apparel supplier to the Campeau stores, said: ''We've shipped a lot of goods to them, but from now on we'll be shipping only if we get some assurance that we will be paid. From what I am hearing today, I think we will get those assurances soon.'' **********A possible Federated/Allied bankruptcy did not appear imminent to suppliers interviewed yesterday, since the stores were paying their bills regularly and as recently as Sunday. Generally, the practice among stores and producers is for the goods to be shipped ''10 E.O.M.,'' meaning they must be paid for by the 10th of the month after the end of the month in which merchandise is shipped. **********Bernard Chaus, chairman of Bernard Chaus Inc., a sportswear supplier, said: ''We are currently shipping the Campeau stores all the goods they want. And we are having the best season with those stores that we have ever had. If they planned to go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy soon, they would have skipped their Dec. 10 payment, wouldn't they?'' **********Campeau's share price fell 50 cents yesterday, to $3.50, in the over-the-counter market. **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation yesterday lowered the debt rating on about $3 billion of Federated and Allied securities. Their senior debt rating was cut to CCC-plus, from Single-B, and the subordinated debt to CCC-minus, from CCC-plus.

Lawyers who have followed the case said they knew of no startling, undisclosed evidence. A spokesman for the Director of Public Prosecutions said, however, that the decision was based in part on ''what we saw of the original papers'' and evidence from police investigations of the case that were begun in 1987. Long Campaign Ended **********The four - they are Carole Richardson, who is British, and Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon, who are Irish - were convicted of bombing an English bar in Guildford that was frequented by British soldiers. Five people were killed and about 65 others wounded in the attack, 30 miles southwest of London, in October 1974. Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Hill were also convicted of a bombing a month later at Woolwich, in south London, in which two people died. **********The case was one of several that aroused controversy in Ireland and prompted claims that Irish people, especially those suspected of terrorism, could not get a fair trial in Britain. **********The decision follows a long campaign on behalf of the four and a Government decision last January to have the Court of Appeal review the case. Doubts about the case were raised immediately after the four were convicted on the evidence of written confessions made while they were in the custody of the police, which the defendants claimed were extracted under duress and which they retracted at their trial. **********Basil Cardinal Hume, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, were among the supporters of the campaign to free the four. Contradictions in Confessions **********Their supporters had offered evidence to the Appeal Court that they said was strong enough to force a retrial. The evidence included contradictions in the confessions, medical findings that Miss Richardson confessed while suffering from prolonged withdrawal symptoms from barbiturates and the statements of a new witness who said she had been elsewhere with Miss Richardson on the day of the bombing. **********Supporters also regarded as crucial the confessions of a group of Irish Republican Army guerrillas who took responsibility for the Guildford attack. Members of the group, who made the claims after they were arrested in 1975 and repeated them at their trial in 1977, were never charged with the bombings but were convicted of other crimes. The case first went to the Court of Appeal in October 1977, when the I.R.A. guerrillas' statements were considered, but judges decided against a retrial and rejected the appeal. **********Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., welcomed the news of the decision today. Sinn Fein's legal spokesman, Paddy McManus, said that the decision, ''far from being a vindication of the integrity of British justice, is a damning indictment of it.'' **********''The decision today by the D.P.P. to order the release of the Guildford Four will be a tremendous relief to the families of these victims,'' Mr. McManus said. ''It is also a victory for those people who campaigned so hard and persistently to prove their innocence.'' **********The Government of the Irish Prime Minister, Charles J. Haughey, said in a statement that the development was welcome ''in the most positive terms'' and that the Irish Government shared ''in what they know will be a general feeling of great relief and satisfaction at the outcome.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/business/talking-deals-how-zeckendorf-filled-a-tower.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1989-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1034, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals; How Zeckendorf Filled a Tower", "print_headline": "Talking Deals; How Zeckendorf Filled a Tower", "body_text": " **********WHERE crowds once roared at the previous Madison Square Garden, between 49th and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues, workers are putting the finishing touches on an office tower and residential complex that pushes the midtown cluster of high-rises and white-collar workers into a neighborhood best known for pornography and cheap bars. **********To overcome doubts about the location among lenders and tenants - and to have the 49-story building rented before several other towers in the Times Square area are completed later this year - a development group led by William Zeckendorf Jr. offered several features to attract tenants. Generous decorating allowances, low rents compared with some other midtown buildings, and even ownership shares of the building were all expensive for Mr. Zeckendorf and his partners. But in the long run, they expect to do just fine with the project, called Worldwide Plaza. **********Having already rented 90 percent of the building under long-term leases, the developers now are far removed from the risks faced in late 1984, when they paid the first $20 million for an option to buy the land for $100 million. Bankers around the world are competing to provide long-term financing, and in the process are bringing down the interest rate to levels more favorable to Mr. Zeckendorf and his partners. **********The permanent financing, the equivalent of a mortgage for a home buyer, is crucial to the financial success of the project because it will allow the developers to repay the more expensive loans taken for construction. **********''The worst position is to have a finished building that is only 40 or 50 percent leased,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said. Permanent financing for a half-full building is more expensive because lenders require letters of credit or other guarantees to assure that developers can pay. A fully rented building, with its predictable flow of cash, is safer for lenders, who can then charge a lower interest rate. **********''To be certain that we were in a position to do the permanent financing, we decided to be very aggressive in our leasing program,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said. In effect, he and his partners were willing to accept less profit in the early years of the project, to reduce their risk and obtain better financing terms over the long haul. **********''Mr. Zeckendorf knew the nature of the asset he had and knew he would have to be pragmatic to find people willing to move into new territory,'' said David L. Schwartz, partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a major tenant in the building with more than 13 floors. ''He was liberal on the economic terms, and as a result, he hit a home run where others might have failed by trying to squeeze the last nickel out of the project.'' **********From Mr. Zeckendorf's perspective, ''it comes down to a choice of who do you want to spend money on; do you want to spend it on a tenant or do you want to spend it at the bank on financing charges for empty space.'' **********The first tenant was Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, the world's third-largest advertising firm, which had been looking to consolidate a number of its 11 New York City offices. By signing Ogilvy for 600,000 square feet, or more than 40 percent of the office building, before construction started in 1987, the project gained more credibility among the lenders, who eventually made construction loans of more than $400 million. **********Ogilvy, for its part, gained a large block of space ''with lower rent than if we had renewed our various midtown leases,'' said Charles Walsh, chief financial officer. Ogilvy also acquired a 17 percent share of the building and has options to expand beyond the 4th through 15th floors that it will occupy initially. **********Cravath, which also signed a 20-year lease with various options to renew and expand, has 376,000 square feet and a 7 percent share of the building. **********As the two largest tenants, Ogilvy and Cravath have arrangements for the prestige and convenience of a ''building within a building,'' with private entrances at street level and their own bank of elevators to upper floors. Both firms were also given ''considerably more'' than the customary $30- or $35-per-square-foot payments, known as work letters, to pay for specially designed rooms and interior decorations, Mr. Zeckendorf said. **********Mr. Zeckendorf's partners in the development -Arthur G. Cohen, Victor Elmaleh and Frank Stanton, real estate developers; the KG Land New York Corporation (an affiliate of the Kumagai Gumi Company, a Tokyo-based construction concern), and the Zeckendorf Company - have not decided on what kind of long-term financing to arrange for the building. **********Under one type of financing, a 100 percent borrowing arrangement, enough money is borrowed to repay the construction loans.

That cost each of them perhaps $10 millions in profits, because Holiday later announced a lucrative recapitalization. **********The commission, in a 4-to-1 vote, said it would no longer routinely exempt institutional investors from a provision of the New Jersey Casino Control Act that requires owners of 5 percent or more of a casino company to undergo a lengthy review process to qualify for a gambling license. Previous Position **********Previously the commission had not generally required such scrutiny of any institutional investor that notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that its interest was passive. **********''I have found nothing in the act or our regulations which would permit us to apply different waiver criteria for institutional investors than for any other beneficial holder,'' Walter N. Read, the chairman of the commission, said at the hearing. **********Anticipating the Aug. 8 ruling, Alliance Capital Management L. P. and Harris Associates liquidated much of their holdings in Holiday. As a result, they missed the sharp increase in the share price of Holiday stock. **********Holiday's stock has risen by more than $10 a share in the last three weeks, largely because of recently announced plans to sell its Holiday Inns to Bass P.L.C. and to pay shareholders a huge one-time dividend. The Memphis-based lodging and gaming concern is subject to New Jersey regulators because it owns Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino in Atlantic City. **********Had they kept their initial stakes, Alliance would have made an additional $23 million and Harris an additional $17 million. **********A spokeswoman for Alliance Capital declined to comment. An investment analyst for Harris Associates attributed the sale to profit taking but acknowledged that his firm ''had a sense they would probably rule this way.'' 'Wanted to Get Out of It' **********Daniel Lee, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, said of the two companies, ''Their lawyers had been advising them the decision might be negative, and they wanted to get out of it.'' **********In the past, the commission has frowned on deals that hinge upon large amounts of debt that could leave the casino companies vulnerable in a business downturn. **********But by discouraging large equity stakes as well, the state regulators are cutting off some of the most attractive sources of low-cost long-term financing available to companies, many analysts, investors and corporations believe. **********To go through the review process, a company would have to hire a special gaming counsel to shepherd it and disclose detailed information about its ownership. **********Should the license application be denied, the investor would have to disgorge any profits earned on the stock. **********As fiduciaries responsible for the money of other people, most institutional investors would have serious difficulty in complying. **********''On a practical basis, it's very difficult for a firm like ours to get qualified,'' said John Raitt, a Harris Associates investment analyst. Efforts to Seek Control **********One reason the commission said it acted was because it felt that a handful of institutional investors had portrayed themselves as passive investors and and then sought control of casino companies. **********A transcript of the Aug. 8 hearing shows that Alliance's 12.1 percent stake in Holiday had dropped to 3.5 percent, while Harris's 7.36 percent stake in the company had dropped to less than 1 percent. **********The institutions will make a handsome profit on their remaining shares, and they probably made money on the stock they sold. **********Harris also owns a 6.05 percent stake in Caesars World Inc., another casino company, which is based in Las Vegas, Nev., and has a casino in Atlantic City. It now has until Sept. 8 to bring the stake below 5 percent or undergo the review process. **********In the case of Alliance, a majority-owned unit of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, there would have been added complications because of Alliance's structure. Alliance is a publicly traded master limited partnership that enjoys certain tax benefits so long as it does not enter new lines of business. Applying for a casino license could thus jeopardize its coveted partnership status. **********''Any time you put restrictions on shareholders, you raise the cost of capital for the company and constrain the company's ability to grow profitably,'' Mr. Raitt of Harris said. **********Others investors and companies called the commission ruling absurd and said it would discourage some of the largest and best-known institutional names from investing in the gaming industry. **********''Most industries welcome investment,'' said Mr. Lee of Drexel. ''It's also a little counter to some of the other noises the commission is making that they're concerned about the degree of leverage and they'd like to see more equity, and then they cut off some of the biggest sources of equity capital out there.'' **********The commission hinted that it might be inclined to issue waivers only in cases where a third party owned more than 50 percent of the stock or retained voting control and thus had absolute control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/28/world/upheaval-in-the-east-bulgaria-communists-and-foes-agree-to-broad-based-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 441, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Communists and Foes Agree to Broad-Based Talks", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: BULGARIA; Communists and Foes Agree to Broad-Based Talks", "body_text": " **********The ruling Communists and an opposition coalition agreed today to hold wide-ranging talks on Bulgaria's future, and the Government dismissed the Interior Minister, who had been criticized over police violence against demonstrators in October. **********After the agreement, an independent labor union called off a general strike scheduled for Thursday.

He likened the failure to the way ''we failed to uproot terror from Lebanon through the military operations'' there. **********The intifada, the Arabic word by which the uprising is universally known here, ''might go another year or two years,'' Mr. Rabin said. ''I don't want to give a date.'' But he said the nation can bear the burden, no matter how long the revolt goes on. **********''I have no doubt about it,'' Mr. Rabin said when asked if the army could continue with a permament deployment of 10,000 to 12,000 troops - sometimes more - in the West Bank and Gaza. ''We will continue with all the measures that we used for the first years, ''including the confrontations, the hitting, the arresting, the introduction of the plastic bullet, the rubber bullet and the curfews on a large scale.'' **********''Soldiers don't like it,'' he said. ''But they understand why we have to do it.'' And besides, he added, ''the intifada accounts for only 4 percent of our defense budget.'' More Than 600 Dead **********Mr. Rabin said that Israeli society ''has adjusted itself to this'' and can continue to make the sacrifices the uprising has forced on Israel's citizens for years to come. **********''What is the choice?'' he asked, noting that Israel has a peace initiative on the table, too. **********The uprising's 24th month will end on Friday; at least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis, and at least 45 Israelis have have been killed in violence related to the uprising. Army figures show that 15,000 to 20,000 Palestinians have been wounded. There have been about 50,000 arrests and imprisonments related to the uprising, and 13,000 Palestinians remain in military or civilian jails. Many are held under harsh conditions although they have not been charged with any crime. **********At least 110 deaths, almost 20 percent of the total, have occurred in the last four months. But the circumstances causing the deaths have changed markedly. In the early days, most confrontations were between soldiers and large mobs of stone-throwing Palestinians. Today, Palestinians seldom demonstrate en masse. Instead, they play cat-and-mouse games with soldiers and Jewish settlers, throwing rocks or firebombs and then running away. **********Soldiers then track down suspects, bursting into their homes in the dead of night and dragging them from their beds. Many of the recent deaths have occurred when soldiers shot suspects who resisted or tried to flee. 'Relative Tranquillity' **********After two full years, Mr. Rabin claims to have reduced the level of violence to ''relative tranquillity.'' He notes that the West Bank and Gaza have never been totally tranquil under Israeli rule. According to Defense Ministry figures, there were, on average, about 350 cases of stone throwing a month before the uprising began. Now, most months, the number exceeds 2,000. **********Mr. Rabin said the uprising may never be considered ended unless a political solution is found, because if the number of violent incidents falls back to the old level, ''even then it will still be called the intifada.'' **********As it stands today, by Defense Ministry figures, 85 percent of the violent activity is stone throwing, and 60 percent of that is carried out by children 13 years old or younger. Although stones have on rare occasion caused serious injury or death, only 5 percent of the violence involves the use of clearly lethal weapons - firebombs, knives and firearms. **********In addition to the violence, work stoppages, commercial boycotts and general strikes continue, and Mr. Rabin admitted that Israel has failed to stop them. **********''The strikes, the closures and the other passive means, we tried to control them and we failed,'' Mr. Rabin said. ''Now we don't try again.'' **********But he and many others in Israel believe that the almost universal adherence to the uprising's rules continues today only because thousands of Palestinians are afraid of what might happen to them if they do not toe the line. The 'Collaborator' Killings **********Almost every day, a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with Israel or defying the uprising's rules is hacked, stabbed or burned to death. And the number of these collaborator killings, as the Paleestinians call them, has grown in recent months. At least 150 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Palestinians in the last two years, but two-thirds of those deaths have been in the last five months. **********''The only possible explanation for this sudden increase in killing,'' Mr. Rabin asserted, ''is that they realize that without strong inner terror even the passive means'' of intifada obervance ''will not be kept up by the population.'' **********But even with daily ''collaborator'' killings, Mr. Rabin noted that the uprising leadership has repeatedly failed to rouse the population to widespread civil disobedience, despite frequent calls in underground leaflets. **********''We have succeeded in the last year in that the majority of the civilian population does not participate in the special calls in the leaflets or on Radio Baghdad or Radio Damascus, to join in big violent or nonviolent demonstrations,'' he said. ''All the talk about civil disobedience has failed.'' **********''We have reached a war of attrition,'' the Defense Minister said.

But through sheer will and physical effort this nation has demonstrated that it can put on a show for the world. **********The Government may have spent more than $4 billion on this festival, by some estimates, but even those figures ignore the billions absorbed as the economy poured its resources into preparation for the festival.  From Drabness to Color **********Instead of producing the dull-colored uniforms that most workers wear, clothing factories have been churning out thousands of traditional dresses, silver-tinseled suits and the costumes of different cultures that youths have been changing in and out of during the numerous ceremonies of the festival. **********Many work units have not only been teaching their workers English, but also the etiquette that they are to assume when talking to foreigners. **********The streets are spotless. Intersections are empty except for the occasional passing motorcade of delegates that creates a five-minute traffic jam. People hardly even wander down the streets; one is more likely to see an army of schoolchildren dressed in blue or red marching down the road after their festival practice sessions. **********Department stores now are stacked with goods unavailable a month ago, some piled on the floor for lack of shelf space. ''Three weeks ago you could not buy onions, garlic and potatoes,'' said a Westerner who lives in the capital. ''There was not a tin of beer in town a month before the festival.''  Exalted Underground **********About 100 yards below street level is a 17-stop subway system that rivals that of Washington, D.C. It is a virtual underground palace, one of the many tributes to President Kim. **********Stations have marble pillars and colorful mosaics of Mr. Kim. The names of the subway also reinforce the political attitude that shapes even the daily outlook of residents in his capital - Glory, Reunification, Comrade in Arms, Red Star, Triumphal Return. **********Along some of the walls are copper-like bas-reliefs that depict the story of how the country was built and the role of President Kim. **********When riders are not staring at the bas-reliefs or the vast wall mosaics of their President, they can view his picture in any one of the subway cabins."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/21/business/yugo-america-plan-backed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugo America Plan Backed", "print_headline": "Yugo America Plan Backed", "body_text": " **********A reorganization plan for Yugo America Inc., the importer of small Yugoslav-made automobiles, was approved today by a Federal bankruptcy judge. **********Under the plan approved by Judge Vincent J.

One that is significant to a relatively small group of people, fewer than a million, but could well represent an investment in the country's future, is the tax treatment of tuition refunds from employers. **********Payments for job-related training are deductible from income under Section 162 of the tax law, but Section 127, which accorded the same treatment to tuition reimbursement for courses that are not job-related, expired at the end of 1988. If Congress does not vote to extend Section 127, Pamela J. Pecarich, partner for tax policy in the Washington office of Coopers & Lybrand, said last week, ''employees will be required to include employer reimbursements for non-job-related educational expenses in their gross income for 1989 and beyond.'' **********Particularly hard hit will be people who have gone to work for universities primarily for the educational benefits. **********Legislation is pending in both houses to restore Section 127. The Senate version is sponsored by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania. The House measure, which has been tentatively approved by the Ways and Means Committee, is sponsored by Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of New Jersey, and Guy Vander Jagt, Republican of Michigan. **********''We're feeling optimistic'' that the benefits will be extended, Ms. Pecarich said, but passage is not assured. The problem is budgetary: the Government estimates the cost of a one-year extension at $300 million in lost tax revenues. **********The real cost would be more like $112 million, Ms. Pecarich said, citing a study Coopers & Lybrand has recently completed under her direction for the Employee Educational Assistance Coalition. She said the firm relied on Department of Education data that were previously unavailable, from the National Post-Secondary Aid Study for 1986, as well as on the Triennial Adult Education Survey, which has been conducted since 1969 and was also used in arriving at the Government cost estimates. **********None of the estimates take into account the possibility that higher tax revenues could be collected in the long run from better-educated people. ''The focus is short-term - you're spending resources,'' Ms. Pecarich said. But cost is not the only issue. Another part of the debate centers on whether Section 127 has achieved its original purposes - to help people become upwardly mobile and more productive members of society, and to reduce administrative costs and simplify the tax code by no longer requiring the I.R.S. to scrutinize tuition payments to determine whether they are job-related. **********The Treasury Department contends that the program has failed to help entry-level or lower-paid employees, benefiting instead better-skilled workers. **********In the Coopers & Lybrand study, however, Ms. Pecarich found a far more egalitarian picture: *********** The distribution of educational benefits closely follows the distribution of earnings among the labor force as a whole: 99 percent of those receiving assistance earn less than $50,000 annually, 71 percent earn less than $30,000 and 36 percent earn less than $20,000. *********** Those attending professional schools - law, medicine, architecture - account for less than one-half of 1 percent of all beneficiaries. *********** Nearly half the students with courses of study that could be identified are in business-related courses. Many others were in engineering, health sciences and nursing, education and computer science. *********** More than 63 percent of all eligible tuition payments are for $500 or less. More than 90 percent are for less than $2,000. **********''In the face of broad Federal cutbacks in aid to education since 1981,'' the Coopers & Lybrand study concluded, ''and given the much-proclaimed national consensus that work-force training and education are essential to American economic progress and industrial competitiveness, proposals to end Section 127 benefits seem premature, if not altogether unfounded.'' The report recommended that the legislation be renewed, at least long enough to gather and study all relevant data. **********''We also question the wisdom of returning to the pre-1979 climate of administrative chaos and extensive litigation in resolving Section 162 issues about educational training expenses,'' the report said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/15/business/alcoa-can-collection.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alcoa Can Collection", "print_headline": "Alcoa Can Collection", "body_text": " **********The Aluminum Company of America said Monday that it had collected a record 16.1 billion used aluminum beverage cans for recycling in 1988, up 35 percent over the 11.9 billion containers collected in 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/24/business/business-people-calfed-chief-quits-at-board-urging.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1989-07-24", "snippet": "LEAD: John R.

Firm Divided Into 2 Units **********The restructuring plan was approved by roughly 85 percent of the firm's partners at a meeting in Dallas on Thursday. The partners voted to divide the firm into two business units: audit/tax and consulting. Each unit will be headed by its own managing partner and will be responsible for its own operations. **********The partners also decided to increase the number of elected board members to 24 from 18. Although the percentage of board representation for consulting has remained the same, the new system guarantees a certain number of seats will be held by partners in the various practices. **********The system of compensation for Andersen's partners was also revised. The firm will set aside funds to reward individual partners and teams of partners for superior performance. Under the new system, if Andersen's consulting unit outperforms the other practices, the unit's partners would be rewarded. Some Still Skeptical **********Despite these initiatives, some observers remain skeptical that the plan has addressed all of the consulting partners' concerns, and said that further departures might result. **********''My impression is that the consultants did not get all that they wanted,'' said David A. Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, based in Fitzwilliam, N.H. ''I was very suprised they didn't get more representation on the board,'' said Chuck Petersen, who left Arthur Andersen several months ago to set up his own consulting firm in Chicago. **********Rival executives also expressed doubts.

She put the range of reasonable prices at 2,850 to 3,000 for the Dow, up from 1,750 to 1,800 then. **********''The valuations are a lot different,'' she said yesterday. ''The Federal Reserve was tightening then. Now they are not. The dollar was getting hammered then, while now it is pretty strong.'' **********Earnings for corporate America are up sharply, perhaps as much as 40 percent, and corporations are paying more in dividends than they did. But there is still caution among some analysts, who say that much of the rise in earnings is past. They caution that real earnings - after taking out inventory profits and adjusting for the effects of changing tax laws -may be starting to decline. **********For many months after the crash, both individual and institutional investors were hesitant to return to stocks. Some still are, but since the spring, equity mutual funds have seen investors put in more cash than they have withdrawn, for the first time since the crash. **********One factor driving the market has been that the wave of takeovers and leveraged buyouts continued after the crash, thereby reducing the supply of stocks. Moreover, while buyouts had been concentrated in companies with relatively stable cash flows even in recessions, takeovers have turned to more cyclical companies, including airline companies like NWA, the owner of Northwest Airlines, and UAL, the owner of United, as well as Falconbridge, a nickel producer. **********The latest rise in stock prices has come as many portfolio managers have concluded that they need fear neither an immediate recession nor a rise in inflation. The budget and trade deficits, which seemed to loom large two years ago, are seldom mentioned now. Foreign investors are again buying in the American stock and bond markets, no longer fearing the deficits will drive the dollar sharply lower. **********''There are times when things work out,'' said Steven Einhorn, the chief investment strategist of Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''This looks to be one of them.'' Mr. Einhorn, who was negative on stocks both before the crash and for many months after it, turned bullish earlier this year. He said he believed ''most portfolio managers are surprised by the strength of it,'' adding, ''There is still a fair degree of skepticism.'' **********After the crash, the widespread view was that it was a precursor of a recession in the economy. While opinions vary, the crash now is largely seen in part as an adjustment of overvaluation and in part as a result of a trading strategy known as portfolio insurance, in which many institutional money managers believed they could get out of stocks quickly by selling stock index futures as soon as share prices began to fall. That selling speeded up and exaggerated the decline. **********In the aftermath of the crash, many institutions abandoned portfolio insurance and adopted a strategy known as tactical asset allocation, in which relative levels of interest rates and stock prices were used to judge whether assets should be in stocks, bonds or cash. The relative handful of money managers who had followed that strategy in 1987 managed to get out of stocks well before the crash. **********But since then, tactical asset allocation has been a failure. Relatively high interest rates for much of 1988 persuaded those managers to avoid stocks generally. While some have bought more shares this spring and summer, many analysts think managers following that strategy will provide much more buying power to push prices higher. **********Such expectations of buying, it should be noted, were also widespread before the crash. The market's recent gains, while they are not so large as in 1987 before the crash, are still extraordinary, including a rise of almost 500 points in the Dow in last five months. **********To some, such rapid gains are a sign that speculation is on the rise. But others insist that a new era is here. ''The pessimists aren't seeing the big picture,'' Edward Yardeni, the chief economist of Prudential-Bache Securities, said recently. ''Communism has failed. Capitalism has triumphed. By 1993, United States Government bonds should yield 5 percent and the Dow should be at 5,000.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/world/arms-costs-now-and-then.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arms Costs, Now and Then", "print_headline": "Arms Costs, Now and Then", "body_text": " **********The United States military budget of $299 billion for fiscal 1989, the current budget year, roughly equals, in constant dollars, military spending during the height of the Korean and Vietnam wars. **********In 1953, the military budget was $297.8 billion and in 1968 it was $297.9 billion, in constant 1990 dollars, according to Defense Department budget tables. **********As a proportion of the American economy, military spending has ranged from 14.5 percent in 1953 to 4.7 percent in 1979, before the Reagan Administration defense buildup began.

Doubts of a Quick Resolution **********Administration officials said that hopes have faded for a quick resolution to the case of the Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who have been in the United States Embassy in Beijing since June 4. Washington had suggested to the Beijing authorities that the couple be allowed safe passage to a neutral third country, but given the cool Chinese attitude, that is no longer a ''live option,'' and, as a result, the couple could find themselves staying in the embassy for a while, the officials said. **********After several days in which the Chinese authorities seemed to be playing down the Fang affair, Beijing has once again turned up its polemics, with the official People's Daily newspaper for the first time accusing the United States today of breaking Chinese and international law by harboring the couple. The official New China News Agency also labeled as ''ridiculous'' recent White House condemnations of Beijing's military crackdown. **********Reacting to these latest broadsides from Beijing, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D.

Solidarity began as a grass-roots pro-democracy movement, was suppressed by martial law in 1981, but eventually emerged in a more powerful and now officially sanctioned form several years later after the Communist authorities in Warsaw found that they simply could not rule, or maintain a sufficient level of economic development, without sharing power. **********For now, the Bush Administration has decided to continue its low-key, wait-and-see approach toward Beijing. **********The Chinese authorities ''are now as isolated in world affairs in some respects as they were eight to 10 years ago before their open-door policy began,'' said Michel Oksenberg, a China specialist at the University of Michigan who formerly worked on the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter.

The advanced video product has become the focus of efforts to bring American companies back into the consumer electronics business, which they have all but abandoned to Japanese and European companies. **********The Bush Administration is divided on that issue, and it has recently backed away from the idea of offering support for any particular industry. But members of Congress and electronics industry representatives say the new report could help swing momentum their way. 'Serious Consideration' **********''I think it's a report that will get serious consideration,'' said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California and a leading proponent of a national policy on high-definition television. ''Hopefully, something like this will move the debate, both within the Administration and beyond it.'' **********Mr. Levine said he expected to introduce a bill soon that would create a Technology Corporation of America, which would be similar to the semiconductor committee's proposed investment company. The major difference, he said, is that his proposed corporation would get direct Federal financing while the semiconductor committee's proposed company apparently would not. **********The semiconductor committee consists of semiconductor and computer industry leaders and high-level Government officials. Its proposal calls for an investment company that would be known as the Consumer Electronics Capital Corporation, which would be privately managed and run for a profit and would serve as a source of ''low-cost, very patient capital'' for companies wishing to enter the consumer electronics business. **********The Government would provide loan guarantees that would enable the corporation to borrow money at low interest rates and invest in new consumer electronics technologies and companies. **********The group issuing the report, known as the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, was created by last year's trade act to come up with policies to maintain a competitive American computer chip industry. **********The panel recommends that the investment company would get initial equity funding from industry sources, private and institutional investors, and state and local governments. The corporation would raise billions of dollars in commercial debt, using Federal, state and local government loan guarantees to insure a low interest rate. **********Such an investment corporation would counteract a key advantage the Japanese have in their access to low-cost capital. Many American companies have said they cannot afford the heavy long-term investments needed to get into the manufacture of televisions, videocassette recorders and other consumer products while still showing a profit for their shareholders. Financing for Sematech **********The report, which has not yet been released, also recommends that financing for Sematech, the Government-backed semiconductor research consortium, be immediately increased to $300 million a year from its current level of $200 million, and by $800 million over the next three years. **********In his cover letter to the President, the committee's chairman, Ian M. Ross, the president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories, acknowledges that the recommendations may be controversial. **********''We have not shied away from controversy,'' Dr. Ross says. ''In this report we present necessary first steps toward a national semiconductor strategy. We believe that the country needs bold and innovative action.'' **********The report never mentions high-definition television, preferring to focus on all of consumer electronics and avoid the criticisms from those who say the importance of high-definition television has been overblown. **********The report documents a decline in the competitiveness of the American semiconductor industry, which makes the silicon chips that are the heart of everything from computers and telephones to robots and weapons. The report finds an equally serious decline in the American industry that produces the sophisticated machinery and raw materials used to make chips. **********The 29-page report also calls for the Government to play a stronger role in insuring that American companies can participate in consumer electronics. For instance, it asks the Government to consider requiring products sold in the United States to use a certain number of United States components. It also calls for the Government to help American companies license the technology they need from foreign companies that now control many of the key patents in consumer electronics. Tax Breaks **********The report also recommends numerous steps to lower capital costs by making the research and development tax credit permanent, reinstating the investment tax credit, reducing taxes on capital gains and facilitating the formation of industry consortiums. It also recommends steps to improve education, protect American patents and copyrights, and promote access to foreign markets. **********Members of the advisory committee from industry were John A. Armstrong, vice president for science and technology at I.B.M.; Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta; Robert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola; Jerry R.

But the proposal leaves open the possibility that a portion of this amount could be used to finance some aspects of the presidential campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the opposition candidate. Objections to Original Plan **********Congress objected to President Bush's original proposal to finance Mrs. Chamorro's campaign by channeling more than $3 million through the National Endowment for Democracy, a private nonprofit corporation that receives almost all its funds from the Federal Government. The Administration withdrew that plan last week, amid Congressional complaints that it would violate the charter of the endowment and taint the organization. **********In addition to the $4 million earmarked in its new request to support the ''election process,'' the Administration is seeking $5 million for the endowment to use in Nicaragua to support ''the democratic process.'' This would include election monitoring and voter registration but not political campaigning. The proposal is intended to comply with a 1985 law under which the endowment is forbidden to ''finance the campaigns of candidates for public office.'' **********Under the Administration proposal, some of $4 million portion - which would not be channeled through the endowment - could be made available to opposition groups including Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the National Opposition Union. Nothing in the proposal would explicitly prevent the use of such money in her campaign. **********Democratic members of Congress said they were confused about details of the Administration proposal and regarded $9 million as excessive, but wanted to negotiate and cooperate with President Bush. **********''This is much better than the Administration's original proposal,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on Latin America. ''I like the idea of supporting the democratic process in Nicaragua, but I reserve judgment until I have a chance to go over the new proposal more carefully.'' **********In a letter to Congressional leaders, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d stressed ''how important it is that we do everything possible to level the playing field'' in an election that ''pits an under-financed democratic coalition against an authoritarian state.'' **********''In Nicaragua,'' he said, ''the Sandinistas are in a box.

Quite the contrary: the market soared to a post-crash high. **********How come? The standard explanation being offered in Wall Street may be called the theory of failed expectations: that when a report is better (or less bad) than expected, the market rises, or, conversely, when the news is worse than expected, the market falls. **********Failed expectations may be closer to reality than the theory of efficient markets, which maintains that markets process all available information, peer ahead and cannot be surprised. **********But the trouble with using the expectations theory to try to explain the market's strong response to this week's inflation report is that the rise in consumer prices was just about in line with expectations, neither above nor below them. The consensus of economists has been that consumer prices would rise in 1989 by about 5 percent. If anything, the March report was worse (not better) than expected. But excluding food and fuel prices, which jumped, the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of about 5 percent. **********Since food and fuel prices are still rising well above that rate and could continue to do so for the next few months, there is reason for concern that the overall increase in the Consumer Price Index for the second quarter could top 6 percent, as it did in the first quarter. That would mean a hefty increase over the 4.4 percent rise in consumer prices for the whole of 1988. **********It is too early, however, to conclude that the underlying inflation rate, determined by the rate of increase in total labor costs, has moved up to 6 percent or higher. The underlying trend of labor costs remains close to 5 percent, and it would take longer than two quarters for a 6 percent rate of increase in consumer prices, assuming that it lasts through this year's first two quarters, to filter into wage rates. It would also take continued pressure of demand for goods and services against the available labor supply and industrial capacity. **********Indeed, if there was a logical foundation for the stock market's rise this week, it was the accumulating evidence that the real economy is slowing down, relieving the pressures on supply. The latest indication of this slowing was the 5.4 percent drop in housing starts, to an annual rate of just under 1.4 million units. If that proves to be the annual total in 1989, it would be the lowest level of housing construction since the deep 1981-82 recession. **********Such a big and spreading soft spot as housing, together with the flattening of industrial production and the softening of retail sales, is likely to stay the hand of the Federal Reserve from further tightening, lest it dump the economy into a recession. The Bush Administration, in the worst way, does not want a recession; given the weaknesses in savings and loan institutions and in the third world debt problem, a steep American recession could play havoc both at home and abroad. **********The highly leveraged position of many American corporations increases anxieties of what a recession would mean now. A drop in the secondary high-yield bond market has resulted from anxious investors' looking for safer havens. And, with relatively high returns available in Treasury bills, notes and bonds, money market funds, insured bank certificates of deposit and highly rated corporate bonds, it is easy enough to find safer harbors. **********Loath as it is to start a recession, the Fed is just as wary of losing its credibility as an inflation fighter: Alan Greenspan, its chairman, and his colleagues are caught in a corner between ''tighter'' and ''looser.'' In that bind, the Fed is likely to stay about where it is until it can determine where the greater threat is coming from. **********As Mr. Greenspan said in Congressional testimony earlier this year, ''If we remain attentive to the course of events and take prudent actions on a timely basis, I am optimistic that we can make further progress toward the objectives of full employment and price stability.'' **********At the start of the year, Mr. Greenspan said that given the inflationary pressures, it would be wiser for the Fed to err on the side of restraint. But the situation has been changing, and it is now more difficult to be sure whether the greater threat is from recession or inflation or from a recurrence of that ailment of the 1970's known as stagflation. **********About half the economists polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators now expect a recession to start by the end of this year or early next year. And the latest price data imply the persistence of the inflationary danger, which could be worsened if the Fed were to switch from a tight to a loose monetary policy too soon. **********Weakness in the dollar could add to the inflationary pressure, and the narrowing of the gap between interest rates in the United States vis-a-vis those in West Germany and Japan is contributing to dollar weakness.

They are demanding that affirmative-action laws deliver on promises to improve the lot of one of Hinduism's poorest rural castes. **********The new movement of farm workers, members of the Vanniar caste, is being watched all over India. Here, the powerless lowest social groups often suffer discrimination and abuse, according to public-action organizations, whose assertions are supported by extensive reporting in the Indian press. **********To some political observers and welfare organizations, the Vanniar movement in Tamil Nadu, India's southernmost state, holds promise as an example to the disadvantaged of success through unity and the strength of numbers. To others, it sounds an alarm, provoking fears of caste-based politics that could further fragment Indian society. **********Where the Vanniar movement leads, and what kind of a model it creates, depends to a great extent on the next moves made by its leader and founder, Sanjivikaundar Ramadoss, politicans in Tamil Nadu and foreign diplomats watching the campaign say. Impatience With Politicians **********The state has a new government, which Dr. Ramadoss said he had already put on notice. The Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assigned a Cabinet minister to meet with him last year and has pledged to study his complaints.  [ A newly elected state government in Tamil Nadu has suggested changes in a state affirmative-action program on Monday in response to Dr. Ramadoss's demands, but militant Vanniars rejected the proposals the same day as ''treacherous and an insult to the Vanniar community,'' the Press Trust of India reported from Madras. The Vanniars are reported to be planning more protests. ]  Somewhere between his birth into a small, dark hut in the village of Keel Siviri, about 10 miles from this market town of 35,000 people, and his comfortable life now as a physician , Dr. Ramadoss grew impatient with politicians, who, he said, cheated his people of their fair share of a generous affirmative-action program. **********Dr. Ramadoss said the Vanniars, scattered in small villages around the town, number 20 million, about a third of the state's population. Federal officials, questioning the figures, say they would like to take a new census and work from that. Shortage of Arable Land **********But whatever the final count, there is no doubt among residents of Tamil Nadu that the Vanniars dominate a large area of rural hinterland west and south of Madras, the state capital. There, mostly on other people's land, they labor in the rice, sugar cane, peanut and vegetable fields. Some Vanniars, less than a fifth of them, own a few acres of arid ground. **********Their villages, already suffering shortages of arable land, have this year been struck by a drought that has emptied their ponds of water and is beginning to dry the wells. **********Dr. Ramadoss, who lives above his private clinic in Tindivanam, said the children in Keel Siviri suffer ''all the diseases associated with malnutrition.'' Affirmative-Action Plan **********At a small, ramshackle building that serves as the Vanniar Organization headquarters in Tindivanam, N. Govindarajan sits at a worn desk listening to complaints of Vanniar men and women. Most need help in dealing with authority or financial assistance. Many want to find a way to educate their children or get them jobs. **********Dr. Ramadoss, who is 52 years old, said that in the 1960's, when Tamil Nadu's affirmative-action program for the lowest of the state's 570 castes was introduced, 105 groups were listed as disadvantaged. Fifty percent of places in educational institutions and jobs in government were set aside for them. **********Eighteen percent was reserved for outcastes, called harijans by Mohandas K. Gandhi. The remaining 32 percent was open to competition among the higher castes and anyone from the lower groups wanting to apply on merit. Rise in Disadvantaged Castes **********In 1967, when a forerunner of the Dravidian nationalist party now in power was the government of the state, Dr. Ramadoss said, the number of castes described as disadvantaged rose to 202, an addition of 97 castes. **********But the 202 shared the same 50 percent of educational and employment opportunities. Worse, the new castes added to the list were able to take a lion's share of the reserve places because they had come from communities with more advantages. The Vanniars, Dr. Ramadoss said, were pushed back further. **********''This Vanniar community has been the most backward educationally, socially and economically for the last 41 years since independence,'' he said. ''The literacy rate of our people is only 20 percent - that state average is 35.'' ''In higher education, in professional courses - medical, engineering, agrcultural science, law -we get only 1 percent, sometimes 2 percent of the places. But our population is one third of the state.'' **********In 1987, under Dr. Ramadoss' leadership, the Vanniars - a caste largely confined to rural Tamil Nadu - began their acts of civil disobedience. In September of that year, they left the fields to blockade major highways for seven days. Nineteen Vanniars were killed in battles with the police - 11 shot and 8 clubbed to death, Dr. Ramadoss said - and 40,000 people were arrested. Occasional Protest Actions **********Since then, there have been sporadic demonstrations intended to keep the case in public view. **********Dr. Ramadoss said that to speed up the caste's development, the Vanniar Organization is asking for 20 percent of the places reserved in schools and jobs for the backward castes in Tamil Nadu and 2 percent at the national level, proportions closer to the Vanniars' percentage of the population. **********''We have conducted more than 10,000 meetings, had 25 district conferences and many agitations,'' he said. ''If our demands are not met, there will be more.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/13/business/the-media-business-publishing-a-growing-acceptance-of-goliaths.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; A Growing Acceptance Of Goliaths", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; A Growing Acceptance Of Goliaths", "body_text": " **********WHEN the Robert M. Bass Group disclosed recently that it had acquired 5.6 percent of the Houghton Mifflin Company, little reaction was heard from the publisher's authors. But 11 years ago, when Western Pacific Industries acquired a slightly larger stake in the same company, that was not the case. **********Fearing a takeover attempt, prominent Houghton Mifflin authors like Archibald MacLeish, John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. raised a ruckus. In a reference to Western Pacific's ownership of a railroad, they protested that they did not want to be published by a railroad and implied that they might take their books elsewhere. **********But that would be unlikely to happen today, no matter what the conglomerate or publisher involved, because book publishing has become a very different business. And many authors are realizing that working under a huge corporation with deep pockets can have its advantages, most of them financial. **********''Not long ago it was considered less than acceptable to be published by a giant corporation,'' said Sterling Lord, a literary agent. ''Now people feel it pays to be published by a giant, even by a foreign giant.'' **********Even Mr. Galbraith seems resigned to what has happened. ''I very much hope that Houghton Mifflin remains independent,'' he said in a recent telephone conversation from Switzerland. ''But in case of a takeover, I probably wouldn't resist the inevitable. In fact, if the purchaser were affluent, my whole bargaining mood might change, and I would try to take advantage of it.'' **********The inevitability to which Mr. Galbraith referred is the transformation of American book publishing from independent houses to conglomerate-owned enterprises. ''For an author to say he doesn't want to be published by a conglomerate is almost like a homeowner saying he doesn't want his electricity provided by Con Edison,'' said Richard Curtis, a literary agent. **********Even the occasional rebellion by an author against a conglomerate publisher is not always what it appears to be. For example, Ken Follett, the British thriller writer, recently declared that he would no longer publish with William Collins & Sons in Britain. According to his agent, Al Zuckerman, Mr. Follett does not like Rupert Murdoch, who recently won control of Collins. But Mr. Follett has no philosophical objection to being published by a large company. Indeed, in this country he is published in hardcover by William Morrow & Company, a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation, and in paperback by New American Library, owned by Pearson. **********''Authors don't have much of a choice, because almost all the houses are mega-companies,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. Besides, ''they are quite happy to accept mega-bucks. They all want million-dollar promotions and they all want to get on television, and the small houses usually aren't equipped to give them that.'' **********William M. Shinker, publisher of Harper & Row's adult trade division, said there has been no adverse reaction from authors or agents to Mr. Murdoch's ownership, since May 1987, of Harper & Row. **********In many cases, authors have been pleasantly surprised by their new corporate parents. For example, not only have conglomerates not cut costs on the physical appearance of their books, but the average book published under Doubleday's current owner, Bertelsmann, is superior in appearance and design to books published when Doubleday was independent. **********Moreover, conglomerate owners, whatever their affection for books, have rarely acted like the corporate bull in the literary china shop. While uncertainty surrounds every takeover, probably none was more feared by the target company than Robert Maxwell's recent takeover of Macmillan. But instead of being ruthless, Mr. Maxwell has been diplomatic. **********Indeed, conglomerate owners and managers have eased fears by adopting a hands-off policy toward their publishing houses, except on the business side. There they have closed units, consolidated operations and reduced staffs - sometimes with a callousness right off the pages of Upton Sinclair. **********That is not to say that the influence of the large owners is not being felt in editorial offices. Ted Solotaroff, now an editor-at-large at Harper & Row, charged in 1987 that ''the corporate mentality'' was so entrenched at major houses that ''midlist books'' -books, including novels and poetry, that are thought to lack strong commercial appeal - had been all but ignored in the search for blockbusters. **********Many such interesting and important books are being published by small and academic presses. But it is hardly to the credit of conglomerate publishers that, after virtually abandoning a class of books and writers, their smaller competitors have sometimes had to step in to remind them of an important role of book publishing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/13/business/dividend-meetings-240889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 334, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of Nov. 12, 1989:  MONDAY  Meredith Corp  Minnesota Mng & Mfg Co  Stone Container Corp  TUESDAY  Amax Gold Inc  CPI Corp  Equimark Corp  FGIC Corp  Guardsman Prods Inc  Longs Drug Stores Corp  Suntrust Bks Inc  WEDNESDAY  Alco Std Corp  Avnet Inc  Bowater Inc  Combustion Engr Inc  Eldon Ids Inc  First Bk Sys Inc  First Va Bks Inc  Fleet/Norstr Finl Grp Inc  Florida E Coast Inds Inc  Foote Coe & Belding  Geico Corp  Home Depot Inc  IBP Inc  Johnson Ctls Inc  Kansas Pwr & Lt Co  Northrop Corp  Pacificorp  Southwest Airls Co  Unionfed Finl Corp  THURSDAY  Air Prods & Chems Inc  Alex & Alex Svcs Inc  AmSouth Bancorp  Black & Decker Corp  Champion Intl Corp  Continental Corp  Dresser Inds Inc  First Fid Bancorp  Florida Progress Corp  Greyhound Corp  Halliburton Co  Hilton Hotels Corp  Laclede Gas Co  Lone Star Inds Inc  Louisiana Gen Svs Inc  Pepsico Inc  Perkin Elmer Corp  Plains Pete Co  PNC Finl Corp  Sterling Bancorp  Tiffany & Co  Time Warner Inc  Wyle Labs  FRIDAY  Barnes Group Inc  BRT Rlty Tr  Campbell Soup Co  Donaldson Inc  Edwards A G Inc  Fays Inc  Millipore Corp  Reynolds Metals Co  South Jersey Inds Inc  Txas Utils Co  Williams Cos Inc"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/29/business/company-briefs-340889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Acme Steel Co., Riverdale, Ill., said it plans to acquire Sudbury Inc.'s Alpha Tube and Beta Tube business.

'Could That Be Done?' **********''Mr. Sherwin called and asked me in summary and in substance: if they wanted to have Union Carbide close for a specific price for several days, could that be done?'' Mr. Jeffries testified. ''And I said, 'Yes.' And Mr. Sherwin said, 'We'll make up any losses.' '' **********He said that on Oct. 29, while he was in New York, he got another call from Mr. Sherwin. **********''In substance he said do you think you can close Union Carbide at 22 today, and I said, 'Sure, I think so,' '' Mr. Jefferies testified.  He said he then called James Melton, the head trader at Jefferies, in the Los Angeles office.

''I told Jim Melton when the request was made to me by Mr. Sherwin that we would close Union Carbide at his request at a specific price and that Mr. Sherwin had guaranteed us against loss.'' **********The trade was then executed at Mr. Melton's direction in an account under the control of Mr. Jefferies. No Buying on 3d Day **********Mr. Jefferies testified that Mr. Melton bought the stock around the close of the business day for two days; on the third day, the stock closed at about $22, so Mr. Melton did not have to do any buying. **********He said that on Friday, Oct. 31, he and his wife had lunch at a resort with the chairman of GAF, Samuel J. Heyman, and his wife, who were vacationing near Tuscon, Ariz.

The emigres have been arriving here in increasing numbers as Asian ports like Hong Kong have taken a harder line against accepting boat people. The Government also said it would evaluate claims for political asylum from mainland Chinese and others. **********Japanese officials said the Chinese being deported were either mainland Chinese or natives of Indochina who took asylum in China in recent years.

In 1985, Japan took the extraordinary step of agreeing to absorb 10,000 Indochinese refugees, and more than 6,200 Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians have resettled here.

Any sensible person would, he added, even if most people would probably call his job less than sensible. **********Captain Miniscalco is a member of the Frecce Tricolori, or Tricolor Arrows, the acrobatic squad of the Italian Air Force. His position is third right wingman. **********Stripped of military jargon and technical subtleties, it means that he helps bring up the rear for an exclusive team of stunt pilots, if one may so inelegantly describe a man whose life is spent performing intricate loops, dips and whirls at speeds of up to 350 miles an hour. **********The inherent danger of his job was brought home in horrifying fashion last year at a United States air base in Ramstein, West Germany, when a fellow pilot, apparently through miscalculation, touched off the worst disaster in air-show history. Nearly 70 spectators and 3 Frecce Tricolori flyers were killed. About 300 other people on the ground were injured, some of them with serious burns. Back in the Public Eye **********After a year of controversy, grief and self-examination, the Frecce Tricolori have only recently begun to appear once more in public, usually as the eye-filling finale at air shows where the other planes are far less spectacular than their Italian-made MB-339A jet fighters. They went first to Belgium in late August, exactly a year after Ramstein, and have since traveled only within Italy, with plans for a few more shows before their season ends in mid-October. **********The calamity last year occurred in the midst of a relatively easy maneuver, one that had been performed countless times without incident since the squad was organized in 1961. **********Nine jets were supposed to split into two formations, tracing a heart in the sky with smoke trails of red, white and green, the colors of the Italian flag. Meanwhile, a 10th pilot, the so-called soloist, was to pierce the heart by flying in from the opposite direction. Instead, the soloist clipped two of his passing teammates, sending them crashing into a runway, while he himself turned into a tumbling fireball that fell into a crowd of 300,000. Remembering the Unspeakable **********Even now Frecce Tricolori members are not sure what happened. Capt. Maurizio Guzzetti was the second left wingman, putting him only eight feet from one of the stricken planes, but all he saw out of the corner of his eye was an indistinct burst of flame and smoke. Later, he and his colleagues watched videotapes of the disaster, and those images still sear their memories. **********''If we didn't have any worries about flying, we would be less than normal,'' Captain Miniscalco said. ''We all think about our lives, about our families. But we have faith in our professionalism, and we understand the importance of our job.'' **********On Sunday, a relatively small crowd of 20,000 turned out to watch the razzle-dazzle at a tiny air strip outside Ravenna, an Adriatic city where visitors tend to be attracted more to the dramatic mosaics in fifth-century churches. **********It was not a perfect day for acrobatic flying. Haze clung to Ravenna like gauze, and so the group's ground commander, Lieut. Col. Luigi Lorenzetti, decided to trim the normal 20-minute program, eliminating maneuvers that required greater visibility than the two miles that the pilots had today. A Sunday Spectacle **********Still, there was more than enough to entertain an audience that had started to form in midmorning. Some people made a full day of it, picknicking on a grassy field or setting up lunch tables in the parking lot. A few arrived early enough to attend a Roman Catholic Mass held alongside the short runway - an appeal for divine protection that even nonbelievers agreed was not a bad idea. **********No one needed a surgeon general's reminder that watching overhead loop-the-loops could be hazardous to one's health. But a prevalent attitude seemed to be that lurking danger was no cause to stay home. **********''Formula One races are dangerous, too, but people keep going to them,'' said Gianfranco Fiore, president of the Ravenna Air Club. **********Nevertheless, there were echoes and whispers of Ramstein. **********Even though team leaders insisted that they had always put safety first, there were conspicuous changes in their program. Somewhat more perilous routines involving a soloist have been dropped, at least for now, because that position of privilege remains vacant. More significantly, the jets no longer scream directly above the crowd, for the flight line is kept at least 1,500 feet away. **********But that is still not enough to help everyone overcome fear of this type of flying. Risks vs. Morale **********After last summer's debacle, West Germany banned such acrobatic displays, as did Ferrara and one or two other Italian cities. For a while, air shows became targets of protest in Italy, usually from left-wing and Green parties and from newspaper editorial writers who argued that such exhibitions served no purpose that justified their risks. **********But team members insist that there are good purposes, even if they may be the ephemeral rewards of publicity and lifted morale. Bluntly put, these young men - able and patently brave - are considered good public relations agents for Italy's armed forces at a time when many Western Europeans feel that the Soviet threat has receded enough to warrant military cutbacks. **********For the nine flyers of the Frecce Tricolori there is sufficient compensation in knowing that they belong to a rarefied squad that has had only 76 members in 28 years. **********''We're not part of a circus,'' Captain Guzzetti said. ''We're not daredevils who put their own lives and other people's lives at risk. The only people who love risk are those who never risked their lives before.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/09/business/the-media-business-advertising-bsb-buys-agencies-in-norway-and-sweden.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "B.S.B.

He said unnamed party leaders failed to see the coming crisis or the gravity of the Kosovo strife because their chief concern was ''to preserve their influence and social status.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/business/a-big-bite-for-nolan-archibald.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1989-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Big Bite For Nolan Archibald", "print_headline": "A Big Bite For Nolan Archibald", "body_text": " **********There is no getting around it - this is a frustrating time for Nolan D. Archibald. For nearly a year he has been shopping for a suitable acquisition to round out the product line at the Black & Decker Corporation, the Towson, Md.-based power-tool and household-appliance company he's headed for three years. A run at American Standard Inc. fizzled when the price got too high. And a run at Sunbeam/Oster fell apart when Allegheny International Inc., Sunbeam's parent, changed its plans for emerging from bankruptcy proceedings. **********Now, Mr. Archibald is on tenterhooks about whether he can land his latest target: the Emhart Corporation. **********This month, what Mr. Archibald calls ''the classic marriage made in heaven'' practically fell into his lap when Emhart turned to Black & Decker to rescue it from an unwanted $35-a-share bid from Topper L.P., a New York investment group. Emhart's distribution channels and products - including Kwikset door locks, Bostik adhesives, Price Pfister faucets and True Temper lawn products - mesh so neatly with those of Black & Decker that they could be parts of a jigsaw puzzle. **********To make matters even nicer, Emhart's 61-year-old chief, Peter L. Scott, readily agreed to become the merged company's chairman and let Mr. Archibald, who is 45 years old, run the combined show. Best of all, Citibank and some other sources stand ready to provide the $3.7 billion that Black & Decker will need to consummate the deal and restructure some of its existing debt. **********But although Topper has not upped its bid, it refuses to bow out. Indeed, instead of letting its offer expire as scheduled last Thursday night, Topper extended it for a week. No one quite knows what Topper is up to, and the company is not saying. But Emhart's stock persists in trading above the $40 per share that Black & Decker has offered - a clear sign that the arbitragers, at least, think the Hartford-based company is still in play. **********Black & Decker's stock, meanwhile, is taking a beating. It has been trading below $20 all week, well below the $23.375 it closed at on March 17, the last trading day before it announced its merger plans. ''The acquisition will certainly move Black & Decker into higher-margin products, but it still has two big negatives,'' said Fred Anschel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. who maintains a ''neutral'' position on Black & Decker's stock. ''They are taking on a huge mountain of debt, and they are looking at significant earnings dilution for at least the next 18 months.'' **********Mr. Archibald insists that Wall Street is silly to dwell on the drawbacks. ''There has not been one analyst, one banker, one shareholder I have talked with who doesn't think Emhart is an ideal fit for us,'' he said. ''But everyone is scared about the impact on short-term earnings. It is awfully frustrating for a C.E.O. who's trying to build the best company he can build to see that the market just doesn't value what he's doing.'' **********There is little question that, short term, the Emhart acquisition will mean some hard going for Black & Decker. Mr. Archibald had been looking for companies with sales of about $300 million or so - companies that would be cheap to buy and easy to digest. Emhart certainly does not fit those specifications. Its 1988 revenues were $2.7 billion, almost identical to those that Black & Decker expects to have this year. That means that if the merger goes through - and Mr. Archibald seems sure that it will - Black & Decker will become a $5 billion behemoth. **********But companies like Emhart do not come cheap. The acquisition means that Black & Decker's debt will skyrocket to more than 80 percent of capitalization, a ratio that makes even the most inveterate risk-taker wince. Earnings will be diluted, and by the time they can conceivably hit respectable levels again, Black & Decker will be facing another financial whammy: the tax-loss carryforwards that have cushioned it since a massive restructuring a few years ago will run out in two years. **********Still, the merged company will have a lot going for it. For one thing, the management teams fit well. Richard H. Campbell, who runs Emhart's consumer products business, spent 14 years at Black & Decker before joining Emhart. And Mr. Scott is said to have circulated a recent Fortune magazine article lauding Mr. Archibald around Emhart, with a note saying this was the type of manager he admired. **********''Black & Decker's team is very marketing oriented, while the Emhart team is very operations oriented,'' said Martin C. Murrer, director of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers, Black & Decker's investment banker in the deal. ''But their personality styles and drives are similar,'' he added, ''and they have a lot of respect for each other.'' **********Moreover, their distribution systems and products fit like a glove. Black & Decker has some commercial sales, but its forte is selling to homeowners. And it has excellent overseas distribution. Emhart is almost the mirror image of its would-be parent. Its primary markets are industrial, and its international distribution needs a shot in the arm. **********The merged company's power-tools and do-it-yourself-products business would have sales of about $2.8 billion; industrial and commercial products would be about $1.4 billion; and household products would be about $800 million. Mr. Archibald is predicting that the merged company can generate additional revenues as high as $50 million just by funneling existing products through the combined distribution system. **********Black & Decker will badly need those added sales to cover costs. Indeed, Mr. Archibald and Mr. Murrer both say that if it were not for the distribution system fit, $40 a share would be too high a price. **********Black & Decker must now make some tough choices. Mr. Archibald intends to sell Emhart's information and electronics systems business, a division that had $654 million in sales last year and that analysts say will probably fetch upward of $500 million. And he says he can slice $70 million to $100 million out of the combined companies' costs. **********Mr. Archibald will not give specifics, but analysts say that closing Emhart's headquarters will save $40 million a year. Mass firings are probably on the agenda, too - Black & Decker plans to set up an $80 million contingency fund for severance pay. Moreover, Mr. Archibald recently told analysts that he could reduce inventories at the combined company by as much as $1 billion. **********Emhart also has a few sundry businesses - for example, it makes machinery for the glass container and footwear industries - that do not fit the merged company's product portfolio. But they do generate a lot of cash and derive a good part of their revenues from recession-resistant parts and services businesses. Mr. Archibald has no desire to get rid of them, but in a financial pinch he could probably sell them for a good price. **********This will not be the first time that Mr. Archibald has implemented an austerity program. When the company hired him away from the Beatrice Companies in 1985 to be its president, Black & Decker was hemorrhaging badly. It lost $158 million that year on sales of $1.7 billion. Customers were defecting to overseas competitors like Japan's Makita and West Germany's Bosch. And its managers, far more attuned to manufacturing and production than to marketing and customer relations, were watching helplessly as the company sank. **********Mr. Archibald, who was named Black & Decker's chief executive six months after he joined, immediately implemented what he calls a ''cut and build'' strategy. He took a $215 million write-off for restructuring. He closed five plants, putting more than 2,000 people out of work. He got rid of a lot of veteran managers, and replaced them with his own handpicked team. He brought George Sherman over from the Emerson Electric Company's Skil division - a direct competitor of Black & Decker - to revamp the ailing company's power-tool division. He pulled in Dennis Heiner, a former colleague at Beatrice, to redo household products. **********Together, the new team turned Black & Decker inside out. They eliminated whole layers of management. They beefed up quality and cost control. They moved to a ''just in time'' inventory-control system. They got rid of the company's geographic management structure, replacing it with a structure in which product managers were responsible for developing products that would sell throughout the world. And they started pumping money into product development and marketing in order to woo recalcitrant customers back to the Black & Decker fold. **********The strategy worked. Earnings for fiscal 1988, which ended Sept. 25, were $97 million on revenues of $2.28 billion. Most satisfying to Mr. Archibald is that at least $300 million of sales came from 150 household and power-tool products and 800 new accessory products that the company has introduced over the last three years. ''That proves that we emphasized the 'build' part of cut-and-build as much as the 'cut,' '' he said. **********That track record undoubtedly made it much easier for Mr. Archibald to raise the money he needed for the acquisition. ''We've known Nolan Archibald since he joined Black & Decker,'' said a senior Citibank executive who asked not to be identified. ''His abilities, and the quality of the people he has hired to surround him - well, you don't find too many teams this good at any company.'' **********Black & Decker still has a way to go before Mr. Archibald can call his turnaround a complete success. The company's return on equity hit 14.1 percent this year - a respectable leap from 1987's 8.8 percent, but still not stellar. Mr. Archibald has said that he wants returns to be in the top one-third of industrial America; last year, that would have taken better than 16 percent. **********If the current deal goes through, Mr. Archibald insists, future increases in profits and returns are virtually guaranteed. ''On its own, Black & Decker could probably earn $3 or $4 a share over the next three to five years,'' he said. ''This combined company has the potential for earning $5 to $6 a share. Isn't the dilution of earnings for a short time a reasonable price to pay for doubling the earnings of the company?'' **********Clearly, his bankers think so. Whether Wall Street comes around - well, that remains to be seen.

Gorbachev, appearing wary and temperamental, today beat back attempts by the national Congress to question the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power and politics in the Soviet Union. **********In the vote rejecting the proposal to take the issue up now rather than later, Mr. Gorbachev was supported by 1,139 deputies, while 839 others favored enlarging the agenda to include debate over the existing Article Six, which gives Communists dominance. Fifty-six other legislators abstained. **********The issue, an echo of the rush from Communism now under way in the Soviet Union's once-obeisant Eastern European satellites, was settled early and quickly by Mr. Gorbachev in the Congress's opening winter session. A Hint of Testiness **********The Soviet leader's obvious concern veered toward testiness at times, as he allocated most debating time to his own insistence on the party's necessary primacy and cut off some speakers, waving his hand dismissively and snapping, ''That's all, that's all.'' **********The debate demonstrated Mr. Gorbachev's overwhelming, near bullying parliamentary dominance of the 2,106-member assembly. The Congress of People's Deputies, the nation's new lawmaking forum, is trying to come to grips with the limited democratic initiatives introduced last spring by Mr. Gorbachev in the nation's first partly competitive elections under its one-party system. **********Only a few deputies came forward to present a call for multiparty politics and an end to Communism's seven decades of monopoly over society. **********Among them was Andrei D. Sakharov, the nobel laureate and human-rights champion, who was unceremoniously cut short by Mr. Gorbachev. But the final vote still managed to put a considerable measure of minority interest in the issue on the public record, indicating, as Mr. Gorbachev conceded, that it likely would return if only as part of a less timely, more drawn out attempt to revise the Constitution. 'A Way Will Be Found' **********''I think a way will be found,'' he declared, while tenaciously defending for now the party supremacy that the Eastern European nations have been typically shedding in their first days of poltical revolt. **********The vote took place in the Palace of Congresses. **********In a long, emotional, at times desk-slapping defense of Communist hegemony, Mr. Gorbachev contended the issue was a choice between remaining on an intensified quest for his perestroika program of national review while guided by the party, or veering off on a ''hasty'' political tangent. **********''We would be making the biggest mistake,'' he said. He argued that he did not necessarily disagree with the proponents of change in the long run, but that changes should come ''in the framework of the normal constitutional process.'' **********That is a framework for procrastination, in the view of critics, but Mr. Gorbachev dismissed their attempt to raise the issue in the Congress as a ''bell ringing'' fire brigade. **********''We must not involve society in clashes,'' he told the lawmakers, some of whom predicted there would be repeated future attempts to debate the party's privileged status. **********One leader of the nationalist movement in Estonia, Marju Lauristin, cautioned Mr. Gorbachev that the issue, now flaming with popular sentiment in Eastern Europe, had arrived. ''It has ripened for discussion,'' she said in a direct, brief summary. ''It's obsolete for our political system and now has become an obstacle.'' Control of the Debate **********Mr. Gorbachev, a lawyer and ever-vigilant master of the Congress's agenda, worked hard to hold the debate to the procedural question of changing the agenda and to rule out substantive statements questioning the party's monopoly on politics and power. **********''I'm asking you two to leave,'' he told two deputies, ruling even before they spoke that their points were not germane. **********''All deputies who do not have something new to propose may return to their seats,'' he announced, waving his hand in frowning contrast to the beaming, cooperative summit leader that so recently was on display in his role more familiar to the outside world. **********One deputy who did reach the rostrum, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the poet, spoke directly as a non-party member to the many Communists in the hall, warning them that in these times the party would be wise to take up the fight to open up the pluralism debate. **********''You cannot gain prestige from a single paragraph,'' he said, referring to Article Six. ''Such authority should be earned daily.'' **********At the last minute, after Mr. Gorbachev had winnowed the speaker's line away, Dr. Sakharov arose from his sixth-row seat and walked slowly toward the microphone. **********His approach prompted groans from some party stalwarts as he advanced to speak. Leaning to the microphone, he pleaded in his characteristic sharp-toned voice for the fullest congressional debate of such amendments crucial to revamping Communism as property ownership and party pluralism. ''We have to open up a way for the Parliament to adopt these laws without amending the Constitution,'' Mr. Sakharov said, speaking of the urgency of the nation's needs. Courtly Appearances Put Aside **********''This will not do,'' Mr. Gorbachev interrupted at one of Dr. Sakharov's points, for a brief moment no longer taking his usual care to appear courtly toward a man respected in the West as a voice of conscience. **********Dr. Sakharov sought to raise Article Six by citing telegrams from the public, but Mr. Gorbachev, unimpressed, interjected: ''I can show you three folders of them with thousands.

Stable Situation Called Aim **********Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, has directed Richard Haass, the newly appointed senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council, to take direct charge of the review, White House officials said. **********''It's in our interest to see a stable situation emerge in Afghanistan, to see the Afghans sort out their problems internally in a way that produces legitimate self-determination on the one hand and a stable government on the other,'' a senior Administration official said. **********Another senior official said, ''The most important thing that can be done at this point is to give the President recommendations and get a general sense of what he wants for Afghanistan.'' **********Mr. Baker's thinking on the policy review by the National Security Council is not known. Nor is it clear whether Mr. Baker will try to take the lead in formulating the Administration's Afghan policy or leave it to the National Security Council. Military Aid Is Issue **********The most immediate issue that Mr. Bush intends to confront is whether the United States should rethink its large covert military aid program to the various Afghan guerrilla groups, senior Administration officials said. **********Mr. Bush and his advisers will also discuss the extent to which the United States should use its influence in telling the guerrillas how to organize their own affairs and an interim government without interfering in their process of self-determination. **********Finally, the President will review recommendations of how to help the United Nations provide food and other emergency aid. Among the daunting tasks are the repatriation of as many as five million refugees from Pakistan and Iran and the resettlement of two million displaced people inside Afghanistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/04/business/gm-seeks-new-image-with-zr-1.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1989-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M. Seeks New Image With ZR-1", "print_headline": "G.M. Seeks New Image With ZR-1", "body_text": " **********Chevrolet's new Corvette ZR-1 zips from zero to 60 miles an hour in a shade over 4 seconds. The car tops out at 180 miles an hour. It meets all fuel-efficiency standards, and it will deliver this performance for about one-third the price of a Ferrari of comparable performance when it reaches the market this fall. **********Priced at $50,000, this muscular version of Chevrolet's two-seat sports car will appeal to relatively few customers. What is more, the 3,500 ZR-1's planned for 1990 can be no more than a blip on the bottom line at the General Motors Corporation, a $100 billion company that normally counts cars by the hundred thousands. **********But in this case, General Motors has made an exception because it is counting on the Corvette ZR-1 to spread its aura over the company's other cars. The auto maker approved the Cadillac Allante and the Buick Reatta because of their image of luxury. Now it is looking to the ZR-1 to project sheer power - what aficionados call performance. **********''The purpose of the ZR-1 is to create an image that is so sensational, so erotic, if you will, that it will draw consumers for Chevrolet's mainstream products,'' said Chris Cedergren, an automobile analyst at J. D. Power & Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif. ''The ZR-1 is definitely a fabulous vehicle, and I think it has the opportunity of doing wonders for G.M. and the Chevrolet division.'' **********Most of the ZR-1's technological wizardry is under the hood, where a 32-valve, 380-horsepower V-8 engine has been packed without an inch to spare. The engine's significance is not so much in its peak output or its band of power at different engine speeds, but rather in the efficient way this performance is generated. **********At low power, some of the valves that admit air and fuel close down, so that the engine mimics a much smaller power plant. This helps the handling in slow traffic and economizes on fuel on the highway. At high power, all the valves kick in to provide the acceleration of a gas-guzzling Ferrari Testarossa. The engine was designed with the help of G.M.'s Group Lotus unit in Britain and is being manufactured for Chevrolet by Mercury Marine, a division of the Brunswick Corporation. Too Costly to Mass-Produce **********Nothing like this engine, however, is expected to find its way into the family car. Chevrolet officials said it would be too expensive to mass-produce. **********About 25,000 standard Corvettes were sold last year and a similar number is expected to be sold this year. Corvettes, with prices starting in the mid-$30,000 range, account for nearly half of the high-performance corner of the new-car market. **********General Motors authorized the four-year ZR-1 project, at an undisclosed cost, less for spinoffs than for the halo effect. Executives hope visitors attracted to Chevrolet dealerships to admire the ZR-1 will wind up buying a Camaro or Cavalier. **********''The ZR-1 makes a strong statement about G.M. and Chevrolet being able to pull it off,'' said Jim Perkins, the new head of the Chevrolet division. ''If a Japanese or European company had done this, probably everyone would be shouting from the rooftops, 'Why can't an American company do this?' '' **********The ZR-1's visibility is already so high among car buffs that it may not need to be advertised. Most of the attention has come in cover articles in automotive publications like Road & Track, Car and Driver, Motor Trend and Automobile magazine. They have given the ZR-1 favorable coverage. **********Chevrolet stoked the publicity fires last month by paying for a press junket to the south of France, where magazine writers test-drove the car. **********Chevrolet said it showed the car in Europe to emphasize its world-beating mission. But other considerations appear to have played a part. Pete Lyons wrote in Car and Driver of ''the grandeur setting, the underpopulated mountain roads and under-patrolled open auto routes of south-central France.'' **********Some writers criticized the car's appearance and price, however. **********''The problem with the Corvette all along has been that its price is out of the ken of the very people Chevrolet's trying to impress,'' said David E. Davis Jr., publication director of Automobile magazine in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''Also, the ZR-1 looks like any other Corvette. The engineers tried to get some new body panels, but there were money problems. An image car should look different.'' May Sell at a Premium **********In any case, eager dealers have already bought out the first year's planned production, leading to speculation that the ZR-1 may be sold at a fat premium over its sticker price. **********''We're probably going to get only six to eight cars next year, and we've already got nearly 25 deposits of $2,000 to $3,000,'' said Mark A. Eddins, president of Friendly Chevrolet in Dallas. **********Most auto companies have at least one car designed primarily as an image enhancer. The Ford Motor Company's Taurus SHO (for Super High Output) is meant to sell tamer Tauruses. Similarly, the Honda Motor Company's Acura division next year will introduce the NS-X sports car, priced at $50,000 to $60,000. ''The only reason Honda's doing that car is to have an image builder to sell more $13,000 Integras,'' Mr. Cedergren of J. D. Power said. No Exotic Chryslers **********The Chrysler Corporation makes no image-performance cars. Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors, has favored building a concept car called the Dodge Viper, whose price would be below that of the standard Corvette. But he has said he may have to kill the project because of the tightening Federal fuel economy standards. **********The image cars, known as exotics, are designed by small, boutique-like European companies like Lotus. Most of these grand names have been bought by larger companies in search of technology and panache. Ferrari is owned by Fiat, Lamborghini by Chrysler and Aston-Martin by Ford. **********The American companies have not made much of their acquisitions, in part to preserve the independence of the famous names. Most consumers are probably unaware that a Ford subsidiary makes the Aston-Martins that James Bond has been portrayed as driving, or that a branch of Chrysler makes the swoopy Countach (pronounced KOON-tash). **********Until the ZR-1, the Big Three American auto companies did not try to imitate the latest European exotics, which tend to sacrifice utility, comfort, ease in handling and fuel efficiency on the altar of performance. Most must undergo power-sapping conversions to meet American emission standards. Even then, they cannot be driven as they were made to be driven, which is also a problem for the ZR-1. **********''You can't get it on the highway in the U.S. and go 100 miles per hour, unless you want to go to jail,'' Mr. Perkins of Chevrolet conceded. ''But some people want to have that power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/06/business/the-media-business-suez-of-paris-buys-insurer-for-4-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1989-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Suez of Paris Buys Insurer For $4 Billion", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Suez of Paris Buys Insurer For $4 Billion", "body_text": " **********Ending the largest takeover battle in French history, Compagnie Financiere de Suez, the Paris-based banking group, today sweetened its bid to $4 billion and won control of Groupe Victoire, the nation's second-largest insurer. **********After a bitter four-week battle, Jean-Marc Vernes, a colorful financier who is Victoire's chairman, said today that he was giving up the fight. He said he had agreed to sell Suez the large Victoire holdings he controlled. **********Suez persuaded Mr. Vernes to sell his stake in Compagnie Industrielle, a holding company that is one of Victoire's largest shareholders, by raising its bid for Compagnie Industrielle to 14,800 French francs ($2,242) a share, from 13,000 francs ($2,008). 10 Options Two weeks ago, Mr. Vernes said he had 10 different options to counter Suez, but today analysts said he had succumbed to the inevitable. ''It was the little guy against the big guy,'' one analyst said. **********This is the second recent coup for Suez, which has $65 billion in assets. Last year, it bested Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, for control of Societe Generale de Belgique, the Brussels-based holding company with large stakes in industry and finance. **********Suez also controls Banque Indosuez, a primary French investment bank. The company was founded in 1858 to finance, dig and operate the Suez Canal, which was nationalized by Egypt in 1956. **********Mr. Vernes said today that he had agreed to sell to Suez because he did not want to threaten Victoire's two-month agreement to buy Colonia Versicherung A.G., one of West Germany's largest insurance companies. He said that Baron Alfred von Oppenheim, whose family controlled Colonia, had told him last weekend that he was worried that the Victoire-Colonia accord might be threatened by the battle with Suez. **********''This was the best solution for Victoire and its shareholders,'' Mr. Vernes said. Rejoicing at Accord **********Suez said that it ''rejoices'' at its agreement with Mr. Vernes. The accord will ''allow it to concentrate fully on the European development of Group Victoire-Colonia,'' the company's statement said. The analysts related Suez's effort to acquire control of Victoire to an expected restructuring of Europe's insurance industry in anticipation of the European Community's elimination of trade barriers at the end of 1992. **********Last weekend, Mr. Vernes began a vigorous campaign to urge shareholders not to tender their shares to Suez. But at a news conference today, he was upbeat, even though he was ceding control of Victoire. **********''I don't consider this operation a failure,'' he said. A holding company controlled by his family, Societe Centrale d'Investissement, is selling its stakes in Victoire and Compagnie Industrielle for more than $3.5 billion, compared with the $530 million Suez had paid for the stakes, he said. **********Trading in Compagnie Industrielle's shares was suspended today on the French Bourse. But on Monday, the stock rose to 14,620 francs ($2,215) a share, the only time its shares were traded since being suspended on Aug. 25. The analysts said this showed that shareholders believed that Suez would have to raise its bid above 13,000 francs a share. **********''Suez paid quite a high price for an insurance company, but it is was the insurance company with the best profit margins in France,'' said Frederic Bombrun, an analyst with Hoare Govett in London. ''That's what they had to pay to insure control.'' **********Suez owned 18 percent of Compagnie Industrielle, while Mr. Vernes's holding company, Societe Centrale d'Investissement, owned 25.2 percent. The analysts said that unless Suez had raised its bid, many shareholders might not have tendered. This could have left Suez without a majority and could have left Mr. Vernes and his allies with a blocking minority. Seeks Other Victoire Shares **********Compagnie Industrielle owns 40 percent of Victoire's shares, while Suez owns 33 percent. In today's statement, Suez also said that it was raising its bid for the Victoire shares it did not own to 2,276 francs ($344) a share, up from its previous offer of 2,000 francs ($303). **********Suez began its bid after it became convinced that Mr. Vernes was seeking to dilute its voice in Victoire as he was preparing to raise capital to finance the Colonia acquisition. Many of the analysts predict that Suez will have to issue more stock soon to finance its acquisition of Victoire, as well as the Colonia acquisition. **********Mr. Vernes said he did not make a counterbid because he did not want to prolong the fight, but many of the analysts said he could not muster the financial wherewithal for an offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/business/briefs-411889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Transamerica Corp., San Francisco, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to $500 million in debt securities with various maturities.

Mr. Savimbi's 26,000-member group has been battling the Soviet-supported Angolan Government since the nation became independent from Portugal in 1975, when China was Unita's principal backer Under the peace accord, South Africa agreed to stop its assistance to Unita, the intials in Portuguese for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. The United States has given Unita at least $15 million a year in aid in the last few years. **********Witnesses have told Amnesty International, the human rights organization, that Mr. Savimbi has had opponents accused of being ''witches'' and then burned in bonfires at public rallies. One entire family, including three children aged 7 to 15, is said to have been killed this way in Jamba, Mr. Savimbi's military headquarters in southern Angola, in September 1983. **********Isaias Samakuva, the Unita representative in London, dismissed the claims today as ''disinformation'' inspired by the Government in Angola. Joao Soares, a leading member of the Portuguese Socialist Party and a longtime Unita supporter, also said he had doubts about the motives behind some of the charges. **********Politically, the most damaging of the accusers is Fred Bridgland, a British journalist who has long portrayed Mr. Savimbi as the leader of a free, independent and democratic anti-Communist movement deserving of Western support. Mr. Bridgland is expected to denounce the guerrilla leader as a repressive totalitarian on a program to be broadcast on London's Independent Television Network Saturday evening. **********Gillian Nevins, a researcher for Amnesty International, said: ''We have reports of well known Unita officials being extra-judicially executed. Unita has denied these claims. We also have reports of military people on the Government side going into areas and torturing, sometimes killing and executing people, but we have been unable to confirm them.'' **********Mr. Bridgland was led to break with Mr. Savimbi by his belief that Unita's former Washington representative, Tito Chingunji, has been detained in Jamba against his will since November. **********Mr. Bridgland said: ''Tito Chingunji failed to return as scheduled from Jamba in November. I have evidence that Savimbi put him before a kangaroo court, accusing him of witchcraft and plotting a coup against him.'' **********''He denied the charges, but was later tortured to confess,'' Mr. Bridgland said. Congressman Questions Report **********In Washington, Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, said he met with Mr. Chingunji in February in Angola. ''If he was dead or being held against his will, I think I would have been able to tell,'' Mr. Burton said in a telephone interview from his home in Indianapolis. **********Mr. Chingunji was also made available to see Mr. Bridgland on his last visit to Jamba. Contacted in London, Mr. Bridgland declined to go into the details of the encounter, but he had earlier described the meeting to Jonathan Kwitny, an American journalist who is preparing a program on Mr. Savimbi for ''The Kwitny Report,'' a television program syndicated on the Public Broadcasting System. **********Mr. Chingunji ''was presented to me as a free man,'' Mr. Bridgland told Mr. Kwitny, ''but he was surrounded by 13 members of the Politburo and it was clear to me that he was in a hostage situation.'' **********The British journalist went on to say that he himself was then put on trial for three hours by a ''kangaroo court'' and ''terrorized'' for expressing his misgivings about Mr. Chingunji's condition. **********Ms. Nevins said her organization had also received reports that Mr. Chingunji had been arrested and mistreated, but had not been able to confirm them independently. **********Unita representatives here said Mr. Chingunji left Washington in November, was promoted to be a deputy secretary general of the movement and has therefore remained in Jamba. He was seen there recently by an American Congressional delegation, they said. **********Mr. Bridgland and a group of students who fled Angola and have now obtained political asylum in Scandinavia have said Mr. Savimbi is also detaining Wilson dos Santos, another Unita diplomat who is related by marriage to Mr. Chingunji. Officials Said to Disappear **********They also said other senior Unita officials had disappeared and were believed to have been killed on orders from Mr. Savimbi. They said the victims included Mr. Chingunji's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jonatao Chingunji, and the former Unita military chief of staff, Jose Alberto Chendovava. **********Mr. Samakuva, the Unita representative here, said the elder Mr. Chingunji had died of natural causes. As for Mr. Chendovava, he said: ''The chief of staff was on the way to a strategy meeting in Mavinga called by Dr. Savimbi. He got out of the truck at 4 o'clock in the morning, just outside the post, and slipped and fell under the wheel after telling the driver to move on and trying to swing back up onto the vehicle. He died two hours later.'' **********The students who have fled - Dias Kanombo, Andre Yamba Yamba and Ermelindo Kanjungu - first made their charges in Lisbon last May. They said that they had decided to investigate Mr. Savimbi's practices after seeing some disturbing sights in Jamba, and that they collected evidence for two years. They said they presented their findings in a collectively edited document to the Unita leadership last year, with a demand for change, but were denounced as traitors, so they made their findings public instead. **********Mr. Kanjungu, 22 years old, is the son of a prominent Unita official still in Jamba. In the document, he said he saw the public beating of three officials accused of disloyalty to Mr. Savimbi when he attended Unita's fifth congress at Chingunjangu, near Mavinga, in 1982. One of them was the group's foreign affairs chief, Tony Fernandes, who he said was saved from death only by the intervention of friends. Report of Family's Burning **********On Sept. 7, 1983, Mr. Kanjungu said, he witnessed the burning on a bonfire of an entire family accused of witchcraft, in the presence of Mr. Savimbi and hundreds of people. Each person present, he said, was told to bring logs to the pyre, and then the accused were brought in, tied to poles. Some tried to escape the flames at the last moment but were thrown back, he said. **********Mr. Kanjungu identified the victims as Joao Kalitangue, a nurse; his wife, Isabel, a kindergarten teacher; their three children, and a 12-year-old nephew. Mr. Kanjungu said a woman called Aurora Katalaio and her two children, one of whom was 7 years old, had also been burned to death. Mr. Kanjungu asserted that Mr. Savimbi had said, ''The party is not going to support the children of witches.'' **********According to Amnesty International, Joao Kalitangue had been accused of plotting against Mr. Savimbi's life, while Aurora Katalaio, who had studied psychology in Switzerland, was the widow of a senior Unita official, Mateus Katalaio, who has disappeared. The students believe Mr. Savimbi had him executed. Mr. Samakuva, the London representative of Unita, said Mr. Katalaio was killed in combat in Lubango in 1982. **********He also dismissed the account of the burnings as an invention by Unita's enemies. ''Burning witches is a common process in Africa,'' he said, ''unless the authorities prevent it, and we do in the areas under our control.'' Interviewed in Sweden **********Dias Kanombo, one of the students, now ekes out a living as a writer in Sweden, where he agreed to talk with a reporter this week after trusted intermediaries abroad relayed messages to him through a post office box. **********''Savimbi is not the originator of these practices in Africa, nor is he a barbarian,'' Mr. Kanombo said. ''He is a leader caught between modern political ideas and African traditional practices. To eliminate the opposition is a Leninist practice, a Stalinist practice.'' **********''The same practices are common on the M.P.L.A. side, including the killing of witches,'' he said, using the Portuguese initials of the Government party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.  CONGRESSMAN CITES VIDEOTAPE **********WASHINGTON, March 10 (Special to The New York Times) - Representative Burton speaking of his meeting with Mr. Chingunji In February, said of him: ''He was on two legs and walking around. I have it on videotape.'' Mr. Burton visited Angola with three other House members. He said Mr. Chingunji had been introduced to them as a leader of Unita. **********A State Department spokesman said the United States had no information confirming the charges by former supporters of Unita.

Many had been bused in from outlying villages the night before and given a free meal, a party T-shirt and lodging. Protective U.N. Presence **********Truckloads of policemen parked under shade trees alongside the white vehicles of United Nations soldiers, assigned to insure free and fair elections. **********In the Ovambo area, United Nations officials have expressed concern that the election campaigning could be thrown into turmoil by South African-led counterinsurgency forces who have been incorporated into the local police force. Swapo has expressed similar concern in the past. But there was no apparent interference by the security forces at the rallies today, and a high-spirited tone prevailed. **********As a few cars, covered with alliance posters, drove along the crowded route outside the Swapo rally, there was good-natured heckling on both sides. **********Simon Kaukungwa, a Swapo leader who had been away for 25 years, addressed the crowd and called for a spirit of forgiveness. **********''We are not advocating a one-party state,'' he said. Declaring that Swapo could count on the support of Namibian business, a group generally supportive of the alliance, he added: ''We won't bite the hand that is now feeding us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/21/business/briefs-421889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Merrill Lynch & Co. is offering $125 million of 10.75 percent notes due on March 30, 1990, at 100 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

Thus, a smaller turnout seemed a certainty, an irony quite familiar in American democracy. **********''This year there was no pressure,'' said one of the former agitatori, Yekaterina A. Kostina. ''The only pressure was from inside.'' **********The option of choice was not universal, with about one quarter of the 1,500 seats for the Congress of People's Deputies being selected today uncontested. But in the other three-quarters, the alternatives ranged from two to 12 candidates and voters in the curtained booths at the polling places drew a line through the names of those they did not prefer. Then, they stepped to a stout ballot box and slipped the folded, unnumbered result inside. The process was prosaic but beautiful to witness in the context of Soviet history. **********''This is the first time and it is all very interesting for us,'' said Dr. Viacheslav Leonov, a physician from the Ministry of Health assigned to help out at the culture center election place on Petrovsky Lini Street. Unhurried and Polite Voters **********He was cordial to a foreign visitor who entered unannounced, showing him all the way into the voting booth and up to the ballot box, past the ubiquitous stare of a Lenin bust, handsomely potted flowers, a tempting buffet of homemade cakes and eight election clerks who smiled busily. **********Outside was the first sight of a crowd gathering, but their enthusiasm was directed at a street peddlar displaying apples and cucumbers. Voters were unhurried and polite. Some were so interested in the election that they remembered to set their clocks ahead Saturday night for the coincidence of Soviet daylight-saving time and so be waiting for the polls to open at 7 A.M. **********By that time three Soviet astronauts had already voted from the spaceship Peace in one of the more surreal displays of openness, floating weightless on the nation's television screens as they earnestly discussed which hometown candidate to choose. **********Lacking mundane paper ballots, the astronauts had to tell their decision by radio, finally voting like self-interested groundlings in choosing the candidate from Star City, the astronauts' privileged hamlet. 'Comrades Vote' **********Down on the streets of Moscow, there were sudden bursts of sunshine amid a day of cold sleet and rain that did not discourage one young couple from stopping to embrace, brazen as all glasnost, and kiss slowly amid the crowds passing near the doors of the Gum Department Store, closed for the day. They held one another, oblivious to the flappings of a large street banner: ''Comrades vote. In your hands is the fate of perestroika.'' **********The voters seemed long inured to such melodramatic slogans. They lined up for ice cream and craned curiously from crowds at the sudden appearance of street hawkers' fresh wares. They closed their eyes and had their hair done in beauty parlors that flourished beyond the red-bannered polling stations. **********In Red Square there seemed a silverly gloom as people crowded idly at police barricades to stare through the drizzle across the empty square beyond the striped towers of St. Basil's Cathedral. They eyed the stolid walls of the Kremlin, as if awaiting some royal birth. In a park to the north, a father cautiously tried his own perestroika, removing one of the two training wheels from his son's bicycle and racing just behind with his hand outstretched lest the experiment fail. **********Television was merciful by Western standards, with barely a few indeterminate reports on the voting, and no mammoth action-news central anchor desk of forced anxiety and matching national map ineluctably turning red once again. 'I Left My Glasses Home' **********Voters cooperated rather freely with an informal sampling organized by Western news reporters. One old woman, asked for whom she voted, confessed: ''I don't know. I left my glasses home.'' **********Others gave their names after liberally criticizing the current regime, a display of personal freedom rated courageous not too long ago. One woman at first declined to give her name and walked on for two blocks but then returned to identify herself as if feeling guilty on this special day. **********''Yes it's a step forward, uncertain and a little ragged,'' said Leon Lipson, a professor from Yale Law School, speaking personally after a day spent monitoring various polling places. Members in his group, a delegation of American monitors from the International Human Rights Law Group, will make a formal statement later this week. **********But as a long-time Russian-speaking student of the nation, Professor Lipson clearly enjoyed the day, particularly in recognizing what he saw as the universal ability of politicians to hypocritically shift their rhetoric to survive in changed times. **********''Generally speaking, a reduction in the high level of violence means a rise in the level of hypocrisy,'' he said as election officials tackled the novelty of sorting out the peoples' choices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/16/business/key-rates-131889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-murdoch-to-introduce-sports-travel-in-june.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Murdoch to Introduce Sports Travel in June", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Murdoch to Introduce Sports Travel in June", "body_text": " **********In June Murdoch Magazines will introduce Sports Travel, a trade magazine catering to sports-minded travel planners, athletic directors, promoters and travel agents. **********Murdoch Magazines, a unit of the News Corporation, also puts out other travel publications, including Travel Weekly, Hotel & Travel Index and Meetings & Conventions.

The protesters carried banners with such slogans as ''Hooligans Go Home,'' ''Protect Women's Rights'' and ''We Demand a Safe Campus.'' **********At the same time, angry posters were illegally stuck to walls at Beijing University. **********The unrest began Dec. 24 with an interracial brawl in the Eastern city of Nanjing, leading to demonstrations by thousands of Chinese calling for punishment of the Africans involved in the fight. The racial confrontation then spread to the nearby city of Hangzhou, where African students briefly kidnapped a university official and then began boycotting classes to protest what they said was officially sanctioned racism. Largest Protest in 2 Years **********Today's demonstration and posters were nominally directed at a small number of African students, but in China they inevitably took on a political tone. Implicit in the protests was the suggestion that the Government gives preference to foreigners and does not adequately protect Chinese women from African students. **********The demonstrations last week in Nanjing were the largest since pro-democracy marches around the country two years ago led to the purge of the Communist Party leader, Hu Yaobang, and to a crackdown on intellectuals. The spread to the capital is significant because that is where unrest is most likely to have a political effect. For example, Beijing University, where the posters were put up, is the country's most famous institution and is attended by the sons and daughters of many leading officials. **********The march and the posters were prompted by an incident early Sunday morning in which a Chinese woman was said to have been attacked by an African student in her dormitory. The marchers said the woman was injured when she fell trying to escape. **********''Such things have taken place many times,'' read a statement distributed by the marchers. ''This time we want the authorities to arrest the criminal and deal with it according to law.'' Boycott Is Begun **********One marcher said: ''We're not against all Africans, but only those who molest our women. They must be punished and expelled.'' **********In Nanjing, where the unrest began, African students who have been released by the police said today that they had begun boycotting classes until their fellow students were also released. **********Some 140 African students, nearly all of those in Nanjing, were rounded up a week ago and taken to a Government guest house to protect them from Chinese screaming racial epithets. But the police then refused to allow them to leave except to return to their universities, where most of the Africans said they felt unsafe. **********More of the Africans were returned to their dormitories today, leaving about 50 still still confined to a guest house or military base in the area. The Chinese Government says that one has been arrested for his role in the brawl that touched off the disturbances, but African students say that at least six others also have been arrested. **********Most of the seven who have been arrested, they say, were not involved in the initial fight but are leaders of an African students' committee that has condemned racism in Nanjing. The students today repeated charges that some of their leaders had been tortured by police; they said they were made to stand naked outside in freezing weather while they were beaten and shocked on the genitals with electric cattle prods. A European student who was with the Africans at the time, but declined to give her name, confirmed their account. **********The African students in Nanjing also reported that Africans studying in Shanghai today began to boycott classes and would continue to do so until the police released everyone detained in Nanjing.

Lawrence Garrett 3d, who played down charges from other computer companies that the Navy's procurement procedures favored I.B.M. **********But he acknowledged that there were systemic problems with the Navy's handling of its contract bidding process in general and announced a number of steps to insure that those problems did not recur. Some Rules Not Followed **********Mr. Garrett said that although an internal investigation found that Navy officials had not followed some regulations and rules in the I.B.M. matter, he was not aware of violations of Federal civil or criminal law by Navy officials. **********''Where facts are brought forward that civil law or criminal law or the military code of justice has been violated, those issues will be addressed within the system,'' he added. **********I.B.M. has admitted that it sold the Government used equipment that was billed as new and mislabeled equipment made in foreign countries as American. These contracts involved sales to the General Services Administration, the Government's purchasing agency, and did not involve the Navy. Violations Called Inadvertent **********I.B.M. has maintained that the violations in its G.S.A. contracts were inadvertent, and has said that it is cooperating with the Government. **********With regard to the Navy contract, the House Government Operations Committee has heard testimony over the last two weeks from Navy and Government officials that I.B.M. representatives helped the Navy write contract specifications; that Navy officials, in violation of the department's own ethics rules on gratuities, visited an I.B.M. training facility in San Jose, Calif., and that I.B.M. used minority contractors in sales to the Navy in an apparent attempt to circumvent certain procurement restrictions. **********But an I.B.M. spokesman, Mark Holcomb, denied that the company had violated any rules or laws. Responding to the possibility of a suspension from Navy contracts, he said in a telephone conversation today: ''There is no basis for suspension. Suspension is used primarily for situations of egregious misconduct by a vendor. Our feeling is that any discussion of suspension where I.B.M. is involved is unwarranted and inappropriate.'' Report of Second Case Denied **********In a related matter, I.B.M. officials denied a report in The Baltimore Sun today that the company was being investigated for a second instance of substituting used equipment for new, this time in a Navy contract. **********Mr. Holcomb said that the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, and not I.B.M., was the target of the second investigation. He added that an I.B.M. subcontract with E.D.S. allowed old equipment to be shipped to E.D.S. When I.B.M. learned from E.D.S. that E.D.S. was in trouble with the Navy because of the old equipment, Mr. Holcomb said I.B.M voluntarily replaced the machines. **********''The bottom line is that we were in complete compliance with the terms of our contract with E.D.S.,'' Mr. Holcomb said. The $544 million contract was awarded to E.D.S. in August 1987. Contracts Being Examined **********In acknowledging last week that it inadvertently sold the Government used equipment, I.B.M. said that this covered only 2 percent of the machines it sold to the G.S.A. The inspector general of the G.S.A. said he was examining more than $4 billion in contracts that it had awarded I.B.M. since 1980. **********In his testimony, Mr. Garrett refused to comment specifically on whether I.B.M. had acted responsibly in its dealing with the Navy. ''I would be remiss, I think at this point in time, in expressing an opinion on that question,'' he said. ''It's a very delicate question.'' **********Mr. Garrett added that he would welcome a request from Congress for a Navy panel to review whether I.B.M should be suspended until there were assurances that all the problems had been solved. **********''If facts were presented to me which raised that issue, I would not object to submitting the information to the suspension and debarment committee for review and to make a recommendation,'' Mr. Garrett said. No Formal Move by Panel **********The committee declined to formally recommend that the Navy should investigate whether to suspend I.B.M. But later in the day the Navy said it would initiate on its own a review to determine whether a formal suspension hearing was warranted. A spokesman for Mr. Garrett said that a timetable for a final decision had not been set. **********Mr. Garrett said that the major problem uncovered by an internal investigation of its own procurement process was the need to develop specifications for contracts with minimum requirements and a lack of expertise to handle the developments of the specifications. **********He announced a five-part plan to combat these problems. One would separate procurement from specification, by providing an independent specification review process to all contracting officers. **********He also said that the Navy should improve its dialogue with industry officials, spur competition for data processing contracts, hold roundtables for computer companies to hear their concerns and complaints, and strengthen the role of the Navy's ombudsman for acquisition matters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/31/business/move-gives-trusts-more-flexibility.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1989-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Move Gives Trusts More Flexibility", "print_headline": "Move Gives Trusts More Flexibility", "body_text": " **********The history of the Rockefeller family is the history of the word ''trust.'' **********In 1892, trust meant the Standard Oil Trust, the juggernaut of companies founded by John D. Rockefeller Sr. that would eventually give birth to Exxon, Chevron and Mobil Oil, three of the world's largest oil companies. Today, trust means the web of legal entities that keeps the patriarch's descendants - at last count, four generations totaling 88 people - from getting their hands on one of the world's legendary fortunes. **********The $846 million deal with the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Tokyo yesterday went far in closing the distance, although it will not enrich anyone immediately. The deal centered on Manhattan real estate - Rockefeller Group Inc. owns landmarks like Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. But it might just as well have centered on the complexity of the word trust. More Liquidity, Less Risk **********''I think it's a terrific deal,'' said David Rockefeller Jr., son of the retired chairman of Chase Manhattan and called by Fortune magazine the heir apparent to the Rocekefeller dynasty and one ''who wants to keep this kingdom strong.'' Mr. Rockefeller hailed the Mitsubishi deal by saying, ''The trustees will be able to invest in a greater range of assets, leading to greater flexibilty, liquidity and lower risk.'' **********There are 14 trusts in the Rockefeller Group, said George Taylor, a spokesman. The family will keep a 42.5 percent interest - 34 percent held by 14 trusts established in 1934 and 8.5 percent held by other family members outside of the 1934 trusts. **********It is no surprise that many Rockefellers are daunted by the complexity of the trusts. ''Many members of this family,'' said a 1986 Fortune magazine cover story on the Rockefellers, ''burn to get their hands on more cash - to spend, to give away, or simply to use as they damn well please. A webwork of trusts frustrates their efforts. But in spirit, if not in its ability to finish the job, this family is down to the cash-out generations.'' Concentration on Manhattan **********Mr. Rockefeller doubts that he or any Rockefeller will see any immediate benefit from the deal. But he does acknowledge that liquidity, the ability to turn a thing into ready cash, has weighed on minds of the fourth generation of Rockefellers, known as the cousins. They have worried about the Rockefeller Group having too much of its assets tied up in Manhattan real estate, which suffered in the disastrous market of the early 1970's. Now the Rockefeller trustees will be able to invest in more liquid assets, whatever they might choose, Mr. Rockefeller said. **********''We're not going to see any money immediately,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.

Fabbri, managing director and chief economist at Midland Montagu, suggested that temporary technical factors might also have kept investors on the sidelines. ''Today is the end of the two-week bank maintenance period, which usually causes banks to scramble to raise funds,'' Mr. Fabbri said. ''But the market should be somewhat reliquefied tomorrow, when $5 billion of 45-day Treasury cash management bills mature. The maturing bills should also free up a lot of collateral.'' Key Word Is 'Mixed' **********As for the release yesterday of the Federal Reserve's latest ''beige book,'' which analyzes economic conditions in the nation,'' Mr. Fabbri said the report contained few surprises. ''The key word in the report was 'mixed' and that is how many economists view the economy,'' he said. **********The latest report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The previous report, which also lacked surprises, was prepared by the Fed's San Francisco branch. **********Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, did find the Fed's behavior yesterday somewhat surprising. ''The first surprise was that the Fed came in about 10:45, or roughly an hour before its normal intervention time, to aggressively pump liquidity into the banking system,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said. ''It was a systemwide effort and the Federal funds rate was only at 9 3/8 percent. We think the Fed was making a statement. it was protesting the high funds rate. If we are correct, it was a signal the Fed is leaning toward further easing.'' **********The Federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for temporary loans and is thus considered the basic cost of credit. But at the end of the two-week bank maintenance period, banks often pay dearly for overnight loans they require to square their accounts with the Fed. Yesterday, for example, Federal funds traded as high as 9 7/8 percent and closed at 9 3/4 percent. Credit market analysts believe the Fed would like to see the funds rate no higher than 9 percent at this time. **********But the high funds rate had little if any impact on short-term rates, as is usually the case. The discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills dropped 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.82 percent; the six-month bills lost 6 basis points, at 7.74 percent, and the one-year bills plunged 10 basis points, to 7.65 percent. **********Today, the Treasury plans to auction $9.5 billion of new one-year bills."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/business/business-technology-one-man-s-fight-for-free-software.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1989-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One Man's Fight for Free Software", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; One Man's Fight for Free Software", "body_text": " **********Richard M. Stallman is a computer programmer obsessed with a mission. He wants to bring back the good old days when programming was a communal activity and those toiling at the craft freely shared their ideas - and their source code, the internal instructions that tell the computer what to do. **********Mr. Stallman, known among his colleagues as ''The Last Hacker,'' has spent the last decade battling a computer software industry that increasingly builds ownership walls around intellectual property. He believes that computer software should be freely shared and devotes himself to creating sophisticated programs that he gives away. **********He spends his days and nights in a cramped office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory working to spread his philosophy that software is different from other physical commodities since it can be copied at virtually no cost. He believes there should be no restrictions on freely copying and distributing it. **********Mr. Stallman's ideas have gained increasing importance of late because the computer industry has been moving toward ''open'' software that will run on many different brands of computers. Consortiums of computer companies have formed to champion their version of the open software, based on the popular Unix computer software operating system. **********But Mr. Stallman carries the idea one step further. Not only should the software run on different computers, but it should also be free. Bitter Objections **********Mr. Stallman is doing nothing illegal, but his is an argument that raises bitter objections from many programmers and companies. They counter that protecting intellectual property is vital to encouraging innovation. **********During the last two decades intellectual property protection has become the foundation of the modern software industry. However, Mr. Stallman asserts that what he calls ''the use of human knowledge for personal gain'' has had a negative impact because information is no longer widely shared. **********''It's impossible to do anything without copying something that has come before,'' he said. ''People talk about the bad effects of government secrecy in Russia. The U.S. is heading for the same place in terms of commercial software.'' **********In a manifesto that outlines his philosophy, Mr. Stallman says that software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them by making each agree not to share with others. **********''I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free,'' he writes. **********Perhaps Mr. Stallman's concept of free software would be easier to dismiss if he was not universally considered - even by his enemies - to be one of the nation's most outstanding programmers. And his body of software is considered distinguished by industry experts. **********The computer industry is now evenly split between two giant consortiums that each claim to champion open software systems based on the Unix system. They contend that the open systems will emancipate the computer user from a single company's private standards. One has allied I.B.M., the Digital Equipment Corporation and others opposite American Telephone and Telegraph and Sun Microsystems. Mr. Stallman is somewhere in the middle and his alternative of truly free software is gaining attention - and credibility. **********For example, Steve Jobs's Next computer comes bundled with Mr. Stallman's free software, and a number of other computer companies, including the Sony Corporation, Sun, the Hewlett-Packard Company, the Intel Corporation and the Data General Corporation, are now giving support to aid Mr. Stallman's development work. **********From his outpost on the M.I.T. campus, Mr. Stallman operates the Free Software Foundation, a loosely run organization of part-time staff members and volunteers that is now well on its way to creating a complete software system called GNU. The name is a Mobius strip-like acronym that stands for ''GNU's not Unix.'' **********When complete, GNU will include a computer operating system and all the tools needed by programmers to design and write the most sophisticated applications for a wide variety of computers. It will also include word processors, spreadsheets, data base managers and communication software, making it just as useful to non-programmers. **********It is a Herculean undertaking, comparable to those that corporations like I.B.M., D.E.C.and A.T.&T. each devote millions of dollars and hundreds of programmers to annually. **********But unlike commercial software ventures, GNU programs are distributed with source code, the original programmer's instructions. This permits any user to modify the program or improve it. While most software companies jealously guard their source code, Mr. Stallman argues that by freely sharing it he has created a software community in which each programmer contributes improvements, thereby bettering the program for all. **********Mr. Stallman, who likes to be called by his initials, R.M.S., forged his values as a member of an elite group of M.I.T. computer hackers who, during the 1960's and 70's, conducted pioneering research in developing the world's first minicomputers and the first time-sharing computers. M.I.T., which is where the term hacker was born, also served as the incubator for many early computer hardware and software companies. **********In that community, software was freely shared among the hackers, who would build their work on the earlier programming efforts of their friends. **********While the press has come to identify the term hacker with malicious individuals who break into computers over telephone lines, the hackers themselves have an earlier and different definition. A hacker, Mr. Stallman said, is one who ''acts in the spirit of creative playfulness.'' **********But while hacking began as intellectual sport and became a way of life in the mid-1970's, many of the hackers who had participated in the tightly knit community of computer researchers left to take advantage of lucrative employment opportunities at the new companies. Only Mr. Stallman remained behind, intent on carrying on the traditions. **********The breakup of the hacker community embittered him and for several years he labored in solitude intent on the incredible task of matching the world's best programmers, writing for free the same programs they were developing on a for-profit basis at their new companies. **********In his book ''Hackers,'' Steven Levy describes how during 1982 and 1983 Mr. Stallman matched the work of more than a ''dozen world-class hackers'' at Symbolics Inc., rewriting their programs and then placing them in the public domain. **********''He believes that information should be free and he interprets it in the most literal fashion,'' Mr. Levy said in an interview. ''Most hackers make accommodations with the way the world works. Stallman doesn't want to make those concessions. He's a total idealist.'' **********Some computer scientists believe there is a place for Mr. Stallman's free software. ''There is room in the world for free stuff and commercial stuff,'' said Brian Harvey, a computer science lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley. ''We don't have to take over the world. Its good enough that I can run his software on my computer.'' **********The most popular GNU program is an extremely flexible editing program known as Emacs. The software package, originally written by Mr. Stallman at M.I.T. in the early 1970's, has become one of the most widely used - and imitated - programming editors. Another widely used GNU program is a compiler, a program that translates text into a form that can be executed by a computer. **********For a programmer, a compiler and editor are equivalent to a carpenter's hammer and saw, the two most important tools of the craft. Emacs's popularity is due to its flexibility, programmers say. An entire computer language is embedded in the program, giving it the utility equivalent to that of a Swiss Army Knife. For tens of thousands of programmers Emacs has become virtually the only program they use because they can fashion it into a data base, word processor, appointment calendar or whatever else they need. **********''You start up Emacs and you never leave it,'' said Russell Brand, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in Livermore, Calif. **********GNU software is freely distributed, but in a different manner from public domain and ''freeware'' software among personal computer users. While public domain software can be freely copied, freeware authors ask users to contribute a fee if they find a program useful. In contrast, GNU programs are not placed in the public domain. Instead they are distributed with a public license that Mr. Stallman calls a ''copyleft.'' This license insures that the software will stay freely copyable and not be incorporated into a for-profit program. **********While Mr. Stallman's software is widely used at universities and research centers and by professional programmers, his zealous commitment to the idea of free software has angered others. **********Several years ago the idea led to a bitter dispute when executives at Unipress Software Inc., an Edison, N.J., company that sells a commercial version of Emacs, pointed out that some of their code appeared in a version of Mr. Stallman's Emacs. **********The problem stemmed from the fact that Mr. Stallman had decided that because the original idea of Emacs was his, he could freely borrow parts of a version written by another programmer, James Gosling, who now works at Sun. While a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Mr. Gosling had written his own version of Emacs and distributed it to friends before giving it to Unipress to sell commercially. **********Mr. Stallman said he had been told by a friend of Mr. Gosling's that he could use parts of the program. Angry messages passed back and forth over computer networks before Mr. Stallman decided that the way to end the dispute was simply to rewrite the offending passages. **********''We thought it was a little ironic,'' said Mark Krieger, president of Unipress. ''He says he plans on taking on the giants and then the first company he goes after is little Unipress.'' **********Despite the remaining bitterness over the quarrel, Mr. Krieger said he had great respect for Mr. Stallman's programming prowess. ''I would give him negative credit for his ideas on free software,'' he said, ''but give him a lot of positive credit as a brilliant design engineer and the creator of the first Emacs.'' **********Today, although he uses an office at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, he is no longer a staff member. He resigned a number of years ago when he set out to create the GNU software system. He makes a living as a part-time software consultant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/29/business/company-news-unilever-calls-off-deal-to-buy-faberge-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas McGill", "pub_date": "1989-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unilever Calls Off Deal To Buy Faberge Inc.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Unilever Calls Off Deal To Buy Faberge Inc.", "body_text": " **********The Unilever Group said yesterday that its agreement to buy Faberge Inc. for $1.55 billion had been terminated. **********Unilever, a multinational consumer products company, had agreed Feb. 10 to buy Faberge.

Largest Takeover Move **********Utility executives and analysts said that transforming investor-owned San Diego Gas into a government entity would be the largest such attempt undertaken so far within the industry. **********Thirty-one new public power systems have been created since 1980. In the same period, 26 public systems have been sold to private investors. At least 70 communities including San Diego are now considering public utility takeovers, the highest level of activity in recent memory, said Paul R. Fry, deputy director of the American Public Power Association in Washington. **********One of the more prominent efforts is taking place in New Orleans, where city officials are negotiating a buyout of two utilities that operate within the city limits. The city has already won court fights with Middle South Utilities Inc. that resulted in rate cuts of $2.9 billion. These victories have increased consumers' support for the city's efforts to acquire two Middle South subsidiaries, said Clinton A. Vince, a lawyer for New Orleans. ''As the public became educated, it's amazing what the city council has done'' to increase local control, he said. A Difficult Task **********Acquiring a local utility can, however, be difficult, and operating one has, in several cases, proved to be even more trying. **********Chicago's recent attempt to win operating control of the Commonwealth Edison Company was defeated, a result attributed to intense corporate lobbying. In Sacramento, Calif., city officials have been sharply criticized for the troubles that plague the municipally run nuclear power plant. And increased competition and consolidation within the industry is leading other cities, like Kansas City, Kan., to quit the utility business and put their plants up for sale. Potential earnings from investment income began to outweigh the priority of having local control. **********As might be expected, San Diego's effort to acquire San Diego Gas is opposed by utility executives and derided by some analysts. **********''There's no chance,'' said Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. 'Not One Penny Left' **********The chairman of San Diego Gas, Thomas A. Page, told The San Diego Union last month that the utility would fight a municipal takeover ''down to where there's not one penny left in the till.'' **********Howard P. Allen, SCEcorp's chairman, said he would not fight a move to put San Diego Gas under municipal ownership, but he doubted that San Diego would try such a move. ''We urge them to make that study,'' he said, adding that ''most studies don't add up.'' **********He added, ''I doubt if any objective study will conclude it's feasible.'' **********In fact, it has become much more difficult for municipalities to establish a public power system because of a provision of the 1987 Federal budget-reconciliation act. The provision prohibits using tax-exempt bonds to finance the purchase of investor-owned utilities. As a result, a public utility buyout must rely for financing on issuing taxable bonds that must pay higher interest rates than municipal bonds. **********In general, an investor-owned utility that is a candidate for conversion to municipal ownership must generate cash flow that exceeds its annual debt service and must be located in an area of continuing economic growth, said Arthur J. Grisi, vice president of Standard & Poor's municipal financing unit in New York. A municipal system has the built-in advantage of operating tax-free, he said. Adequate Cash Flow **********A preliminary financial evaluation of San Diego Gas conducted for the San Diego County Water Authority indicates that the utility has adequate projected cash flow to cover interest expense, even at interest rates of 13.5 percent. Even so, Mr. Grisi said, ''those numbers don't mean enough'' to make an initial judgment whether the resources of San Diego Gas can cover its projected needs as a public system. **********Wounded pride and potential economic losses aside, even officials in San Diego County concede that they will not support a municipal takeover that would be an economic burden. **********''If we can finance it, it's in our best interests, but I'm not willing to mortgage the city,'' said David L. Malcolm, a city councilman in Chula Vista. **********Utility executives, including SCEcorp's Mr. Allen, maintain that private enterprise operates utilities more efficiently than government. 'Statistics Don't Lie' **********However, an 18-year survey of the utility industry by the Energy Department shows that public systems overall have lower costs for production, distribution and administration. ''Statistics don't lie,'' said Mr. Fry of the American Public Power Association. **********There are exceptions. Geographical differences and the mix of energy sources for generating power make some investor-owned systems less costly to operate. **********Besides seeking potential customer savings, cities and counties pursue public control of utilities as a means of establishing social policies and serving economic interests. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was one of the first utilities to offer low-cost ''lifeline'' rates to the elderly. Cities have also used subsidized power as an inducement to lure industry. Broad Public Role **********''The role of a public entity is much broader than delivering power,'' said Austin V. Koenen, managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s public finance unit. The municipal utility's mandate, he said, must emphasize public services, ''something that isn't necessarily of interest to shareholders.'' **********San Diego officials figure they have at least a year's work to determine if a takeover of San Diego Gas can be accomplished. Moreover, they face a struggle against a company that has a reputation for persistence, political connections and good service. **********''Edison is extremely well managed and very professionally operated,'' said Norman E. Nickols, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles power agency. ''They provide us here with a very tough yardstick for competition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/world/soviet-paper-reports-discovery-of-slain-czar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 614, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Paper Reports Discovery of Slain Czar", "print_headline": "Soviet Paper Reports Discovery of Slain Czar", "body_text": " **********A well-known Soviet screenwriter and former policeman says he unearthed the bodies of Nicholas II, Russia's last Czar, and the Czar's family a decade ago and wants to give them a proper burial, Moscow News has reported. **********The screenwriter, Geli Ryabov, told the Moscow weekly newspaper that he was convinced he had found the remains of the last of the Romanov Dynasty's ruling families in a pit in Sverdlovsk in the Ural mountains by the number of corpses, the type of wounds and the dental prostheses. **********The bodies had been hidden to keep the burial place from becoming a shrine for monarchist pilgrimages, Mr. Ryabov said. **********The account was published Wednesday in the current Moscow News, along with a photo of a blackened skull the paper said Mr. Ryabov identified as that of Nicholas II. **********''The conviction ripened in me that I must find out and tell people the truth about the execution and burial of the Romanovs,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Ryabov as saying. **********In July 1918, soldiers acting on Bolshevik orders took Nicholas and 10 others, including a 14-year-old boy and six women, into a basement in a Sverdlosk house and shot them. Nicholas, born in 1868, was forced to abdicate in March 1917 as revolution swept Russia. **********The Communists seized power in November 1917. **********Until now, Moscow News said, investigators assumed they could not find the bodies because the remains were reported to have been dropped into a mineshaft where they dissolved under a layer of acid, leaving only meager traces including buttons, some jewelry and a cut-off human finger. **********But Mr. Ryabov said he embarked upon a quest to find the true resting place of the murdered family. He first went to Sverdlovsk, formerly known as Yekaterinburg, in 1976. Mr. Ryabov said he read everything ever written about the incident, including investigators' reports, and even enlisted the aid of the children of the commissar who oversaw the shootings, Yakov Yurkovsky. **********He said his police experience helped lead him to a clue: certain documents mentioned that the truck carrying the bodies got stuck in a swamp. **********''And I decided to find that place,'' Mr. Ryabov told Moscow News. ''Ten years ago, when we uncovered the burial mound - there's no other word for the pit into which they had thrown the naked bodies to lighten the truck - and even after that, I just couldn't publish the results of my investigation,'' he told the newspaper. ''Those weren't the right times.'' In the franker atmosphere fostered by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for glasnost, or greater openness, wider room has been allowed for discussing both current problems and some darker epsiodes of Soviet history. **********In Mr. Ryabov's reconstruction of what happened, the faces of the corpses were beaten with rifle-butts to prevent identification and acid was poured to dissolve their features. **********The house where the shootings took place was destroyed in 1977, the newspaper said. **********Mr. Ryabov says he is prepared to submit his find to experts, but only ''if permission is received for proper burial for the executed befitting people and Christians.'' **********Mr. Ryabov gave Moscow News only a partial account of his find.

Concern has been mounting in the industry that air travel is now considered too expensive by travelers who earlier in the decade were attracted by the low fares spawned by deregulation. **********But industry analysts questioned just how available the bargain tickets for children are likely to be. The airlines in recent years have established sophisticated computer systems that enrich a carrier's revenues by carefully managing the availability of discount fares as the demand for full-fare seats fluctuates. The carriers do not disclose the number of discount seats available. Should demand for higher-priced business seats remain high into the summer, the number of special discount seats might be meager. Getting People to Call **********And at least one consumer group said the availability of the special fares might be limited because the airlines see the fares as a way to generate travel inquiries that will lead to the sale of a higher-priced ticket when a discount seat is unavailable. **********''There was some leisure sticker shock out there,'' said John Nelson, Continental's executive vice president for marketing. ''We were facing a diversion of people from airplanes to cars this summer.'' He said response to the discount fare has been ''much bigger than we expected.'' **********The Continental offer, which carries many restrictions, allows children aged 2 to 17 to fly for $1 when accompanied by a parent. The offer is limited to travel on Tuesday or Wednesday, but children can fly for 50 percent of the Maxsaver fare the rest of the week. **********The promotional fares carry heavy restrictions, like advance-purchase and minimum-length-of-stay requirements. The tickets are nonrefundable, but the airlines will allow passengers to make one change to their itinerary without penalty. **********Most other airlines undercut Continental's symbolic $1 offer by allowing children to fly free. Northwest Airlines will also charge $1, which it will donate to the Boys Club of America and the Girls Club of America, a spokesman for the airline said. Follows Fare Rise **********The airlines' promotion comes on the heels of a fare increase announced by Continental earlier this month. Effective May 27, the airline will raise its discount fares by as much as 18 percent. Several other carriers have since matched the increases. **********Overall fares have risen about 15 percent since August, said Julius Maldutis, airline analyst with Salomon Brothers. Fares for the business traveler have been especially high, analysts said. **********Like any other discount fare, the number of seats available for the ''fly a kid for free'' promotion is limited. **********''It's highly capacity-controlled,'' said Alan Loflin, a spokesman for Pan American World Airways. On any given day, ''it's likely that the inventory of discounted seats will be sold out,'' he said. **********Chris J. Witkowski, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Washington-based group, said: ''The purpose of the promotional fare is to get people to pick up the phone. If you don't fit into the pigeonhole of restrictions, they'll suggest another flight at a higher fare.'' **********Mr. Witkowski said his organization petitioned the Transportation Department in 1987 to require airlines to allocate at least 10 percent of their seats at the promotional fare advertised or inform the public if fewer seats are available. The agency has not yet acted on the petition, Mr. Witkowski said. **********Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, parent company of Continental, said in a recent interview that the public is often deceived by promotional fares, because the number of discounted seats can vary greatly from one airline to another. A Strong Response **********But travel agents said the response to the promotional fares has been strong. ''A lot of people are rearranging their travel dates to conform to the restrictions,'' said Helene Coren, an agent with Travel Trends in Fort Lee, N.J. **********Continental has developed a reputation for offering the lowest fares, and some analysts said its latest promotion is intended to fortify its status as a discount airline. **********''Continental wants to be the first name you think of when you want a low fare,'' said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of Travel Agents. **********Because of the heavy restrictions placed on the offer, it will cost the airlines little, analysts said. **********''It generates a lot of good will, but the airlines are just giving up a few empty seats, '' said Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei. **********The promotional offer may help stimulate the leisure-travel market that airlines like People Express helped create in the early 1980's. Lately, airlines have concentrated on attracting the business traveler, who is generally willing to pay a higher fare, often because he must travel on short notice and his company or business is paying the fare."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/world/the-malta-summit-new-spur-for-a-new-journey-together.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Mr. Bush began his **********Presidency seeming more skeptical than his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his ideas. But the meeting in September between the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d marked a turning point, and two days of meetings here apparently convinced Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev not only that they could trust each other but also that they needed each other to achieve their political goals. **********So what their foreign ministers began amidst the scenic splendors of Wyoming in September was completed this weekend in the gales of Malta, as the leaders agreed to link their political fortunes in an effort to build a world free, as Mr. Gorbachev put it, from the ''psychological and ideological struggles'' of the last four decades. **********No formal agreements were reached here; there was not even a written joint statement, let alone anything as formal as a communique. But the summit conference generated a sense of momentum, an intangible but important dynamic element, that the Soviet-American relationship had heretofore lacked. **********As he had promised before arriving, Mr. Bush took the Soviet leader to task for his nation's Central American policy. But at the joint news conference given by the two men in lieu of individual sessions, the American President vividly demonstrated how eager he is to make the new relationship work. **********Mr. Gorbachev had denied sending arms to El Salvador, Mr. Bush noted, while the United States had hard evidence that Soviet arms were reaching the insurgent forces there. Other American Presidents might have left the matter there, with the implication that the Soviets were being less than candid. But Mr. Bush reached a completely different conclusion. Benefit of the Doubt **********The Sandinista Government in Nicaragua, the President said, must have shipped the Soviet weapons to El Salvador and then lied about their activities ''to our Soviet friends.'' **********Only at a time when the American attitudes are undergoing a profund change, with more and more Americans looking upon the Soviet Union not as an enemy but almost as the ally that it was during World War II, could Mr. Bush so clearly signal his willingness to give Mr. Gorbachev the benefit of the doubt. It will be more difficult now for his critics at home to accuse him of half-heartedness in his approach to the changes wrought by the Soviet leader. **********The most important achievement here, one of Mr. Bush's advisers said, was to put ''a new political impetus, a new impetus of personal leadership,'' behind United States-Soviet relations. The clear feeling among White House staff members and senior Kremlin officials was that this, plus an accelerated timetable for two sets of arms-reduction talks, plus good chemistry between the two leaders, made success in their summit conference next year in the United States a probability, not merely a possibility. For Gorbachev, Welcome Offers **********''I couldn't have asked for a better result from this non-summit summit,'' President Bush said. For Mr. Gorbachev, the broad spectrum of economic assistance offered by his friend in the White House, from better access to the Western trading bloc to lower tariffs on Soviet products in the United States to (improbably enough) American help in setting up a Soviet stock market, could not have been more welcome as the Soviet Union begins a long, cold winter. **********Most of all, a Soviet official said, Mr. Gorbachev was greatly relieved that Mr. Bush now seemed fully engaged in the relationship in a way that he had not been before, and seemed disposed to look for ways he could help the Soviet program of perestroika, or restructuring, toward success. **********In the early months of the Bush Administration, some officials questioned whether Mr. Gorbachev was really a reformer and asked whether the White House should help him. Those in favor of Mr. Gorbachev argued that Ronald Reagan, in the last years of his Presidency, had become more trustful of Mr. Gorbachev. Remaining Problems **********The mood generated here may prove less transitory than earlier waves of good feeling generated by summit meetings, but there are still problems with regard to regional conflicts, as in Central America, and with regard to arms control, with both sea-launched cruise missiles and chemical weapons. **********''Look, we've got some differences,'' President Bush acknowledged.  Both leaders seemed eager to sidestep the German question, for an evident reason: any move by the two Germanys to amalgamate or confederate will tend to undercut the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Warsaw Pact or both, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev are counting on those two organizations, perhaps in changed form, to give them leverage in Europe. **********Mr. Bush, furthermore, was at some pains to avoid giving offense to the Western Europeans - at least according to the accounts of his aides. He may have told Mr. Gorbachev of plans to cut United States troop strength in Europe; if so, he will presumably tell his allies in Brussels on Monday. **********The plan to hold the conference on board Soviet and American warships, which was a White House idea, designed perhaps to generate public-relations echoes of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks during World War II off Newfoundland, didn't work out as planned, having failed to take into account the unpredictability of the weather. The meetings had to be shortened and moved to the cruise liner Maxim Gorky, docked nearby, because of mountainous seas. **********Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, President Bush made no claim that the cold war was over, and unlike Mr. Reagan, he made only modest claims for the nature of his relationship with the Soviet leader. **********''I don't think that he has me down as a total negativist'' said Mr. Bush of Mr. Gorbachev, ''and I certainly don't have him down as one.'' **********In the end, Mr. Bush proposed more here than his staff had indicated that he would, and Mr. Gorbachev proposed less than expected. But then, it was Mr. Bush's turn, since the Soviet leader has been springing suprises almost weekly in recent months, and Mr. Bush must have been dying to do something unexpected, given his almost obsessive delight in keeping secrets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/31/world/protesters-march-to-kgb-headquarters.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1989-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 683, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protesters March to K.G.B.

The Pushkin Square gathering was sponsored by the Democratic Union, an opposition group that regularly attracts considerable attention from the police. **********The evening began with young students, relatives of K.G.B. victims and others turning out for another benchmark in the continuing test of the limits of ordinary citizens' right to outspokenness. Police officers outside the dark, stony K.G.B. headquarters were noticeably polite as demonstrators quietly arrived, circled the building, lit their candles and held a silent protest for precisely 30 minutes. **********''The people have to know stories like mine,'' said Irina I. Kalina, who held a flower, a burning candle and photographs of three members of her family who perished 50 years ago, after their arrest by the K.G.B. ''As a 9-year-old girl, I was arrested and sentenced to five years simply because I would not testify to lies against my sister.'' Watchword for Fear **********The K.G.B. headquarters is attached to its special prison, known as Lubyanka. The word Lubyanka has a forbidding sound to Russians because for years an invitation to ''visit'' the headquarters carried with it the possibility of being arrested and not heard from again. The prison, with 110 cells in the center of Moscow, gained its reputation as the most notorious place for political detainees of the Stalinist era. Some prominent early Soviet leaders, including Zinovyev and Kamenev, are believed to have been executed there. **********However, it was at another prison, Lefortovo, that most of the brutal interrogations, killings and torture were carried out. The prison has been used to house prominent foreigners. Dzerzhinsky Square is named after the first head of the Soviet secret police. Lubyanka is the name of the square before its being named for Dzerzhinsky in 1926. **********The events tonight provided a glimpse into the uncertain nature of current street politics. Neither demonstration would likely stir the nation's majority, and each was a measure of the state's edginess, with the police out in greater force for the smaller Democratic Union gathering. **********Participants said they were inspired by both the history of their nation and the unfolding events in Poland, Hungary and East Germany, where popular protest has been forcing concessions to democracy. **********''Sometimes, I have the feeling Gorbachev is scared he started all this,'' said Vasily Kuntsev, gesturing to the long line of fellow demonstrators. ''Gorbachev did not realize the difficulties he would have to face,'' Mr. Kuntsev said. **********''After all is said and done, what is happening in the country is still controlled by the Kremlin,'' a neighboring demonstrator said, echoing others who complained that the new right to protest was crimped by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's opposition to any dilution of the Communist Party's dominance. **********''We have more words but not real freedom'' said Yelena Pechenko, a 20-year-old student, cupping her candle in the wind.

It was the Soviet Union's first broad exercise in democracy since nationwide elections in March. **********Official results in the two republics are not expected until later this week. Election officials said that the paper ballots would have to be counted and the results verified before the outcome could be made public. **********Although the local councils are responsible for such prosaic matters as housing, sewers and bus routes, people here in Latvia generally agree that the election boiled down to a two-party race whose outcome may suggest the shape of the republic's future. Anti-Party Gauge **********The voting is also being watched as a measure of anti-party sentiment as the People's Congress of Deputies, or national legislature, prepares to meet Tuesday in Moscow. The congress is the focus of growing pressure to legalize multiparty politics and to end the Constitution's guarantee of Communist control of the Government. **********Most of the candidates in Latvia are affiliated either with the Communist Party, which was put in place when Stalin annexed the republic during World War II, or with the Latvian Popular Front, a grass-roots political organization that is calling for the republic's independence. **********Although the Communists are guaranteed a monopoly on power by the Latvian republic's constitution, officials admit that the party's membership is eclipsed by that of the Popular Front, an organization with links to similar groups in Latvia's Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Lithuania, and elsewhere in the country. **********Latvia's Popular Front says it has about 220,000 registered members, compared with some 180,000 members claimed by the Latvian Communist Party. Officials of the party and the front say that about 40,000 people are members of both groups. Subdued Communist Campaign **********Most candidates in Estonia either were independent or were backed by Estonia's Popular Front or by the Communist Party. The Communists generally were subdued in their campaigning, and none of the republic's Communist leaders were running for office. **********The popular fronts' showing in the local elections will be a telling signal of whether they have the strength to take control of the Estonian and Latvian Supreme Soviets, or parliaments, when elections for those assemblies are held March 18. The parliaments conceivably could test the provision in the Soviet Constitution that allows for secession by the republics, a move opposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********The Latvian Central Elections Commission reported before the voting that 41 percent of the candidates were Communists and 31 percent were members of the Popular Front. No figure was available on the percentage belonging to both groups. **********The Union of Latvian Agricultural Workers supplied 19 percent of the candidates, the commission said, and 5 percent are members of Interfront, a movement that defends the interests of non-Latvian residents of the republic. A Random Sampling **********A random sampling of voters leaving two polling places, one here in Latvia's capital and one in Jurmala, a resort town 12 miles away on Riga Bay, found considerable Popular Front support. **********Asked what criteria she had used in choosing her candidate, a woman in Jurmala offered a typical response. ''I'm Latvian,'' she said. ''I voted for the Popular Front.'' **********A man in Riga said he cast his vote ''for independence, a free economy, a free market and a government of the European type.'' **********The Popular Front distributed newsletters naming its candidates and affixed labels with its distinctive red logo to billboards. **********In March, voters selecting deputies for the new national legislature used their ballots to reject Communist Party functionaries viewed as unenthusiastic about change. In Latvia, candidates supported by the Popular Front won 36 of the 52 races in March. Issue Is Independence **********The Popular Front's central issue is its call for independence. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were independent nations until Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression treaty in 1939 that set the stage for Stalin's annexation of the three republics the following year. Baltic residents have long called for the Soviet Government to condemn the treaty and to right the historical wrong of their annexation, which the United States has never formally recognized. **********While many people of Latvian descent support the front, its membership is not exclusively Latvian. While slightly more than 50 percent of Latvia's 2.6 million people are ethnically Latvian, about 33 percent are Russian, and there are other small minorities of Byelorussians, Poles, Ukrainians and Lithuanians. **********In Estonia, about 60 percent of the residents are ethnic Estonians. Defying the Kremlin **********The election comes as Latvian Communists debate the local party leadership's plan to discuss secession from the national Communist Party in defiance of warnings from the Kremlin. **********Orthodox Latvian Communists have been calling for the resignation of the Central Committee since it announced that it would meet in early January on the secession issue.

It also shows how indistinct the line between magazine advertising and editorial content is becoming as advertisers seek merchandising and promotion support from publications. **********''It's unbelievable,'' said Samir A. Husni, head of the magazine journalism program at the University of Mississippi and the publisher of an annual directory of new magazines. ''Especially in the women's magazines, we are seeing more and more of this blending of advertising and editorial.'' **********Guidelines established by the American Society of Magazine Editors prohibit the use of editorial staff members in the preparation of advertorials, but editors differ over whether these rules govern the use of contract writers. **********Edward Kosner, editor and publisher of New York magazine and a member of the committee that drew up the association's rules, said he recalled that their intent ''was that people who write editorial'' should not be involved in advertorials. **********But John Mack Carter, the editor in chief of Good Housekeeping, a Family Circle competitor, said he did not believe the relationship between Ms. Stewart and Family Circle violated the guidelines. However, he called Ms. Stewart ''kind of a walking advertorial in herself.'' **********Officials of Family Circle dismissed any notion of a conflict of interest. ''Contributors, particularly celebrated ones, often have outside affiliations,'' said Jacqueline Leo, Family Circle's editor in chief. ''The biggest thing is how you tell the reader. If we hid the K Mart connection, that would be shabby and a disservice. But this is up front.'' **********Ms. Stewart, 47 years old, whose volumes on weddings, cooking and parties have sold about 1.8 million copies, is K Mart's ''life style and entertaining consultant,'' a position for which she is reportedly receiving $5 million. She is also a contributing editor of Family Circle and is being paid for the home-renovation articles as part of her contract with the magazine. **********In 1987, K Mart hired Ms. Stewart as a consultant to help it attract ''baby-boom consumers,'' said Michael Wellman, the corporation's vice president of marketing. **********Shortly after, Ms. Stewart purchased a 150-year-old house in Westport, Conn. At a news conference yesterday in Manhattan, she said she considered it ''a wonderful place to put all those products K Mart advertises.'' **********A K Mart marketing consultant brought in Family Circle, a publication of The New York Times Magazine Group. Ms. Stewart was already a contributing editor of the publication, which is published 17 times a year. Its circulation of 5.9 million and its 1,856 ad pages led all women's-service magazines last year. **********Beginning in its Feb. 1 issue, Family Circle will cover Ms. Stewart's renovation of the house. K Mart has purchased more than 60 pages of advertising in the magazine - more than four times its 1988 ad schedule - and is assembling three 8-to-12-page advertorial sections describing how products sold in its stores can be used in reconstructing houses. **********Family Circle's 1989 ad revenues from K Mart will approach $4 million, about half of which is being returned to the chain through the promotional programs Family Circle is developing for it, according to Charles H. Townsend, the magazine's publisher. **********The advertorials will also be featured in Better Homes & Gardens magazine, and will be distributed in K Mart stores. The retailer has brokered some ad space to 37 of its vendors, whose wares will be featured in the advertorials. **********K Mart is using the project to introduce a Martha Stewart signature line of home furnishings. It has also shot 43 television ads about the project, in which Ms. Stewart endorses specific products, such as Dutch Boy paints. In addition, the company will feature the project in freestanding inserts in Sunday newspapers. **********Mr. Wellman declined to comment about the cost of the project's marketing support.

Dealers attributed the latest ''stocks for bonds'' move to a sharp selloff in equities that pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down at one point by as much as 85 points. **********While the stock market erased almost all but 3.69 points of its loss by the close, long-term Treasury bond prices retained more than half their gains. The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, for example, were being offered late in the session at 102 24/ 32, up another 17/32 for the second straight day, while the yield fell to 7.88 percent, from 7.93 percent the day before. **********In Chicago, the spot December Treasury bond futures followed a similar pattern. After soaring as high as 100.4 during the worst of the stock market decline, the contract fell to an intraday low of 98.31, before closing at 99.19, up 18/32 on the day. **********''It was another 'stocks for bonds' day, but nothing like the flight to quality we experienced on Oct. 13,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''As is often the case, the bond market moved inversely with the stock market and in tandem with the Treasury bond futures in Chicago.'' Fixed-Income Market **********Also benefiting the fixed-income market, Mr. Ricchiuto continued, was the one-tenth of 1 percent decline in September durable goods orders that was reported early in the day. While the decline was outwardly modest, the report showed a significant drop in orders for nonmilitary goods. This indicated a further softening of the economy, which is bullish for fixed-income securities because it can reduce upward pressures on interest rates and inflation. **********''As for the third-quarter G.N.P. figure that everybody is waiting on, it should show 2.7 percent growth on an annual basis,'' Mr. Ricchiuto predicted. ''But that may be a plus for the bond market because most of the growth will be in inventories. This should reduce orders for goods as well as the growth of fourth-quarter G.N.P.'' **********The Government's estimate of third-quarter gross national product is expected to be released early tomorrow. **********Meanwhile, the sharp early drop in the stock market kept the Federal Reserve from draining more of the reserves it pumped into the banking system after the Oct. 13 market break. Fed Draining of Reserves **********Brian J. Fabbri, managing director and chief economist at Midland Montagu, said that ''the Fed still has a need to drain reserves, but with the Dow off 50 points and sinking at noon, they obviously thought it best to defer any such move.'' He added, ''With the stock market recovery, we can expect the Fed to drain in a day or two, if for no other reason than to keep the funds rate at their apparent target of 8.75 percent.'' **********Federal funds, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, eased to 8 11/16 percent, from 8.75 percent early in the day. **********Mr. Fabbri said that the September report on durable goods orders was good for the fixed-income market ''because if we subtract the huge rise in defense orders last month, the overall drop in orders would be quite large. September is usually a month when spending on military needs rises sharply because Congress likes to keep this spending away from the new fiscal-year budget, which starts Oct. 1.'' **********Mr. Fabbri said, however, that despite the favorable climate in the Treasury debt market, ''the results of the two-year note auction were rather disappointing.'' **********''The resultant yield should have been lower,'' he said. ''Hopefully, the first auction of Refcorp bonds will be well received.'' **********The Treasury's auction of $10 billion of new 7 5/8 percent two-year notes produced an average yield of 7.74 percent, the lowest since April 27, 1988, when it was 7.64 percent, and well below the 8.39 percent at the last sale of this maturity. The outstanding 8 3/8 percent notes of 1991 rose 1/32, to 100 31/32, for a yield of 7.82 percent. **********Today, the Treasury plans to auction $4.5 billion of Resolution Funding Corporation 30-year bonds. Refcorp was formed last summer to bail out unprofitable savings and loan institutions. Yesterday, these bonds traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.17 percent, down from 8.20 percent the day before. It is expected that similar amounts and maturities of Refcorp bonds will be auctioned on a quarterly basis. **********Elsewhere in the secondary market for Treasury debt issues, the 8's of 1996 rose 5/32, at 100 22/32, to yield 7.87 percent; the long notes, the 8's of 1999 advanced 6/32, to 100 27/32 and a yield of 7.87 percent. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of new two-year notes:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)          Average Price   99.791        Average Yield   7.74%        Low Price   99.772        High Yield   7.75%        High Price   99.827        Low Yield   7.72%        Accepted at low price   49%        Total applied for   $24,174,680        Accepted   $10,038,880        N.Y. applied for   $21,345,050        N.Y. accepted   $8,626,990        Noncompetitive   $819,000        Interest set at   7 5/8%       The two-year notes mature Oct. 31, 1991."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-rebound-is-predicted-in-advertiser-spending.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rebound Is Predicted In Advertiser Spending", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Rebound Is Predicted In Advertiser Spending", "body_text": " **********Advertiser spending in the United States in 1989 has not kept pace with the increase in the gross national product, although it should rebound in 1990, said Robert J.

And the story could not have been more Japanese when Nomura Securities, which later acquired 20 percent of Wasserstein, Perella, shipped five members of its staff to the new firm to learn the takeover game: the five were neither consulted nor told why they had been chosen. **********''It was totally a voice from heaven, you could say,'' said Hiromi Yamaji, one of the five and a vice president. ''It's not the Japanese style to ask why.'' **********The contrast is just one of dozens in an unusual cross-cultural experiment: teaching Japanese securities professionals the rough-and-tumble acquisitions game, a uniquely American business and an activity that until recently barely existed in Japan. The Start of a Trend **********Already, the experiment has turned into something of a trend. The Blackstone Group, a highly successful mergers and acquisitions firm set up by two former Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb investment bankers, Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman, sold a 20 percent interest to Japan's Nikko Securities and has three trainees. And the Lodestar Group, led by Ken Miller, a former vice chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, and Robert Baldwin, a former chairman of Morgan Stanley & Company, will soon take on two Japanese trainees from its 20 percent shareholder, Yamaichi Securities. **********Other American securities firms have taken on Japanese professionals for training, but it is in the mergers business that the cultural contrasts are most evident. From the power breakfast to screaming negotiating sessions and million-dollar bonuses, the American style of mergers and acquisitions is a world away from traditionally indirect and slower-paced Japanese business methods. **********Consider income. The Blackstone Group's three Japanese professionals are still paid a typical Japanese wage by Nikko and thus earn less than $100,000 a year - a fraction of what the American professionals working elbow-to-elbow with them receive. And the list goes on. A Service Business Test **********The experiment may provide some insight into a significant issue: Will the Japanese prove as adept at learning, and then dominating, service businesses as they have at a range of manufacturing industries, like automobiles and computer chips? Even though the Japanese securities firms have made virtually no headway into mergers and acquisitions so far, they have clearly chosen it as a global growth business. The Japanese trainees are their advance parties. **********The flood of Japanese investment in this country has added urgency to the Japanese desire to learn the mergers advisory business. Increasingly, Japanese investors are buying whole companies, not just their stocks and bonds. But Wall Street firms, as veterans of the takeover wars of the 1980's, are far ahead of their Japanese competitors in brokering these deals and garnering the huge fees. **********Not coincidentally, this is the first financial business in which the Japanese securities firms have acknowledged that they cannot go it alone and have sought help in the form of joint ventures. **********''The question for them was, do you have 100 percent of nothing or 20 percent of a good thing?'' asked Joseph R. Perella, his firm's chairman. Management Style Questioned **********Shin Kijima, a managing director at Wasserstein, Perella, said: ''I think that in the M.&A. or investment banking area the Japanese management style does not work. But we'll change if we need to.'' **********''They are students and businessmen,'' said Toshio Mori, chairman of Nikko Securities' United States division, referring to the Nikko professionals at Blackstone. ''We don't have expertise in this business because there has not been much M.&A. in Japan. But things are changing and as we look five or ten years ahead we do believe M.&A. will become important in Japan.'' **********The flow of information is not one way, of course. Although the Americans may be training their future competitors, they are getting access to Japanese corporations and financial institutions that no American firm has been able to tap independently, an important new source of business. **********''What we've gotten,'' Mr. Schwarzman said, ''is use of the whole Nikko network in Japan.'' Language Difficulties **********The Japanese cultural barriers to American-style deal making start with language; the Japanese word for a corporate takeover, ''baishuu,'' can also mean bribery. So Japan's big securities firms have given their merger departments euphemistic titles. Nomura calls its takeover group in Tokyo the Business Development Department, while Nikko's is the Company Information Section. **********The linguistic problem underscores the fact that in a country that regards corporations as surrogate families for their employees, the idea of selling or buying a company is fraught with negative implications. **********''You don't have so many deals traditionally because to put a company up for sale generally means there has been some kind of failure,'' said Masanori Ishikawa, the head of Nikko's mergers and acquisitions department, now working at Blackstone. ''It is very shameful.'' The Power Breakfast **********To the cosmopolitan Japanese involved in these studies - most have lived overseas and have American M.B.A.'s - some contrasts have clearly proved refreshing. Some are as small as the typical Wall Street meeting - the 7:30 A.M. power breakfast. In Japan, the norm is to meet for long dinners and rounds of drinking, which insure that Japanese executives do not enjoy much of a home life. **********''It was a little unusual the first time, but I'm more comfortable now with a breakfast meeting,'' Mr. Yamaji of Wasserstein, Perella said. ''I'd rather get up early and get home early.'' **********Most Japanese here also enjoy the informality of the American firms that is considered essential to allow a free flow of ideas. By contrast, the rigid hierarchy of a Japanese securities company limits who can deal with whom and even the form of speech used. **********''I was very surprised to find Mr. Peterson and Mr. Schwarzman talking to the junior people, or an associate talking with Mr. Peterson about a company,'' said Hiroyuki Kondo, a Blackstone associate from Nikko who is the veteran of the group, with a year and a half of experience at the American firm. ''I came to realize that it's part of their concept of the business.'' Sudden Changes **********The lack of a rigid structure is also evident in the speed with which negotiations can change direction or tone in this country, and the direct participation of chief executives in the process. **********''One day they say we're not interested, the next day they say let's talk,'' said Mr. Ishikawa of Blackstone. ''American people change their minds so quickly.'' **********Another distinct element is the financial engineering that goes into an American-style takeover, especially a leveraged buyout. Investment bankers often spend vast amounts of time lining up financing and devising the financial structure, which can include everything from bank loans and ''junk bonds'' to preferred stock and warrants. **********''Financial structure is not so important in Japan because there is so much money available,'' Mr. Ishikawa said, referring to the enormous cash hoard that Japanese financial institutions have amassed because of the country's huge trade surpluses and high personal savings rate. ''Companies usually just go to their banks.'' A Shortage of Specialists **********One of the greatest barriers, though, could prove to be the lack of merger specialists in Japan. The Japanese firms rotate executives from one department to another every few years throughout their careers. This builds a strong coterie of generalists, but it means that businesses that require highly specialized knowledge or long-term personal relationships - like takeovers - are not done as well. **********''Mr. Kijima and I have been telling Nomura that they should consider changing the career process to keep people in M.&A. to really learn the business,'' said Mr. Yamaji, who added that they had not met with much success so far. **********Mr. Mori of Nikko said that in Tokyo, his firm had instituted a new policy: young executives can choose to specialize rather than enter the rotation. But it means they give up any chance of becoming president. ''We have not had many people choose to do that,'' Mr. Mori said. **********The Americans tend to reject worries that this might yet be another business that the Japanese slowly move into and then dominate. 'Alien to Their Culture' **********''That's always a risk in any business where you have arrangements like this,'' said Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone. ''But keep in mind that the deal technology business is quite alien to their culture. They aren't going to adjust that fast.'' **********Mr. Perella said he did not expect the Japanese to become serious competitors. ''This is a high-margin, brainpower business,'' he said. ''This is a service with an arcane set of rules. You don't mass-produce it. M.&A. is going to be done on what I call the Anglo-Saxon standard around the world. It isn't like a VCR, where they can learn the technique and then capture the market.'' **********Perhaps the biggest guarantee that the Japanese will never play the takeover game quite the way Wall Street does is the individualism found among merger specialists, many of whom have developed into media stars with large egos to match their skills. In a Japanese company, an outsize ego is generally not an asset. **********''Bruce and Joe are excellent people and I admire them greatly,'' Mr. Kijima said of Mr. Wasserstein and Mr. Perella. ''But, of course, you cannot transfer all of their style.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/17/business/at-budget-hotels-growing-pains.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1989-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Budget Hotels, Growing Pains", "print_headline": "At Budget Hotels, Growing Pains", "body_text": " **********Judging by the jammed parking lot at the Fairfield Inn here, one might think that the budget hotel business is flourishing. But now, with more than 50 such chains in business, the supply of inexpensive rooms is beginning to outstrip even the surging demand for them, and occupancy levels and profits are sliding. **********Some of the best-known names in the hotel industry - including Marriott, Ramada and Quality Inns International - have been opening hotels with no-frills rooms for as little as $25 a night. Their target, increasingly, is the business traveler whose cost-cutting employer is no longer willing to foot a bill of $75 or more. **********The result has been a fierce competition for market share. Many operators are cutting prices further, stepping up their advertising and even resorting to giveaways. Indeed, industry analysts now joke of ''amenity creep'' - a move from offering spartan rooms to providing simple perquisites like shampoo and free phone calls, and then on to more exotic frills like facsimile transmission and phones that permit computer hookups. Some May Be Forced Out **********Given such competition, industry experts say, a number of chains will be driven out of business or forced to merge. **********Budget hotels are not new. Motel 6 dates from the 1960's, when it offered rooms for $6 a night, and the Days Inns chain started in the 1970's. Days Inn is still the largest chain of budget hotels, with 81,600 rooms expected by the end of the year; Motel 6 is second, with 60,000. **********But in the last two years one big hotel chain after another, troubled by stagnating revenues in their full-service hotels, have entered what was once a land of ersatz leather furniture, gold shag rugs and bathtubs with broken tile. The Marriott Corporation, for example, developed Fairfield Inns; the Ramada Corporation acquired Rodeway Inns, and Prime Motor Inns Inc., which owns the Howard Johnson hotels, acquired Wellesley Inns, a budget chain operating in the Northeast. Quality Inns International, which already owned the Comfort Inns chain of ''luxury'' budget hotels, the third-largest chain, developed Sleep Inns. Old Chains Expanding **********Even industry old-timers are getting into the act. Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inns, has started his second chain, Wilson Inns, expected to open 14 properties by next month. **********Meanwhile, budget hotels in existence for years are expanding rapidly. Days Inns of America, the Atlanta-based chain, recently developed Daystop, a barebones operation for $25 a night. And Hampton Inns, which since its inception in 1984 has replaced the since-sold Holiday Inns as the principal lodging chain of the Holiday Corporation, plans to open 55 budget hotels this year, up from 40 in 1988. **********''Years ago we used to have rooming houses; now we have budget hotels,'' said Steven Brenner, a leading industry consultant based in New York. **********Market figures bear this out. Since 1981, the number of hotel rooms over all has increased by 2 percent annually, according to Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting and consulting firm. But the number of budget rooms grew by 20 percent in 1988 and is projected to rise 17 percent this year, to 613,500 rooms, according to Laventhol. **********So fast has the growth of inexpensive hotels been that by the end of the year roughly one in five of the three million hotel rooms in America will be in the budget category. Rates Sharply Lower **********Budget hotels are for people concerned mostly about a clean bed and bath, a television set and a telephone. Rates average $32 a night, compared with more than $60 a night for conventional full-service hotels. **********Yet in many ways, some budget hotels are hard to distinguish from their full-service counterparts. At the Fairfield Inn in Peoria, for example, guests get two queen-sized beds and a large work area, and can tune in scores of television channels received by a satellite dish out back. **********But at the lower end are the so-called hard budget hotels, which offer one bed and a shower but not a bathtub, and in some cases bath towels that might more appropriately be called paper towels. **********While the pace of development of budget-hotel rooms has recently shown signs of abating, growth is still so overheated that ''small, regional chains will be hard-pressed to compete,'' said Daniel W. Daniele, a Laventhol executive who tracks the budget-hotel business. ''Only the big national companies will have the marketing dollars to maintain a competitive edge.'' Consolidation Under Way **********The industry shakeout has already produced consolidation. Motel 6 acquired Sixpence Inns, a budget chain operating in the West, as well as parts of Envoy Inns, which is in the Midwest. Kings Inn, an inexpensive chain in the Southwest, became part of the Comfort Inn chain. And Skylight Inns, which also operates in the Middle West, joined the hugeTravelodge chain. **********The budget hotels' success has not been at the expense of the most luxurious hotels. Top executives and other wealthy people continue to stay at such hotels. Rather, the chains have been taking business from more middle-of-the-road properties like Holiday Inn, Ramada Inn and Howard Johnson's. **********Some hotel chains have steered clear of the budget-inn business, fearing it might adulterate their image. **********''You can't be all things to all people under one brand name,'' said William Hulett, president of the Stouffer Hotel Company, which has not entered the budget business. ''Ultimately, that confuses people. When people think of Stouffer hotels, we want them to think it will cost them $100 a night to stay there.'' A Lower Break-Even Point **********Big hoteliers that do invest in budget chains like the much lower break-even point of those hotels, largely the result of less fixed overhead than their full-service brethren. They need be only 52 percent to 55 percent full, compared with 65 percent to 68 percent for a full-service hotel. **********What is more, occupancy rates at some budget hotels now run close to 70 percent. While the budget hotels have scored their greatest successes among self-employed entrepreneurs, independent salespeople and other travelers paying their own way, more and more big corporations have begun to send lower-level employees to budget hotels to control costs. Some of the companies are: General Motors, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, I.B.M. and Caterpillar. Business travelers now make up the budget hotels' largest customer group, providing 42 percent of revenues. **********Moreover, the financial risk posed by budget hotels is much lower than that of the more expensive hotels. Because they are often placed in rural areas and outside major cities, where land costs are low, budget hotels can be built for as little as $32,000 a room. ''A full-service room can cost double that to build,'' said Robert F. Fitzgerald, chief executive of Rodeway Inns. Profits Lower **********Most budget-hotel properties remain in the black. An economy hotel that charges the industry average of $32 a night for a room might pay about $7.50 a day for linens, laundry and cleaning for that room. Another $7.50 a day may go for overhead and the hotel manager's salary. That leaves $17 before fixed charges like rent or mortgage, property taxes, insurance and interest are paid. After those expenses, profit now averages $1.09 before income taxes, down from $4.17 two years ago, according to Laventhol.

That, they said, might take months. **********Experts on the war say the decision to to try to overwhelm the city was made by consensus in a council of war last month. But there was no single commander or staff to make a professional assessment of its chances of success. Some guerrilla field commanders reportedly opposed the attempt because it was potentially too costly in lives, but were persuaded to go along with the majority who sought a quick victory. Lack of wholehearted support by some of the guerrilla units may have caused the attack to stall. **********In attacking Jalalabad, the guerrillas violated a tenet of guerrilla warfare. Guerrillas normally avoid attacking enemy strong points. Instead, they isolate and wear down the enemy by attacking where he is weak until resistance starts to collapse. It is only then that guerrillas launch conventional attacks on the centers of an enemy's power. **********Pakistani and Pakistan-based Central Intelligence Agency advisers to the guerrillas were aware of the plans, a military officer said, but it is not known whether or not they encouraged the attack. Independent experts say the Pakistanis have more influence over the guerrillas than do the Americans, who are primarily involved in providing training and logistic support."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/21/business/at-chicago-boards-styles-differ.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Siler", "pub_date": "1989-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Chicago Boards, Styles Differ", "print_headline": "At Chicago Boards, Styles Differ", "body_text": " **********Whether the subject is baseball or commodities, Chicago is a city that breeds different styles at its rival institutions and fierce loyalties among their supporters. **********In the weeks since a Federal investigation of the exchanges was made public, the Chicago Board of Trade, the institution that has dominated this city's financial community for most of its 141 years, has adopted a public stance far different from that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. **********While the Board of Trade recently voted not to make significant changes in the rules governing its trading practices until the scope of the investigation had become clear, its younger rival, the Chicago Merc, announced soon after the investigation became public that it had appointed a special panel to recommend some of the most sweeping changes in its 70-year history. 'Extraordinarily Cautious' **********''The Board of Trade has been extraordinarily cautious about this investigation, while the Merc quickly acknowledged the possibility of a problem and took steps to deal with it,'' said Thomas A. Russo, an expert in commodities law and a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. ''Yet they're both still stuck on the horns of a dilemma.'' **********It is striking that these two bitter rivals, each keenly aware of how much is at stake for themselves and the city of Chicago, have embarked on such different paths. Yet, long-time observers say that their responses have been consistent with their divergent political traditions, their memberships and the personalities of their leaders. **********To do any differently, they say, would have been as surprising as if diehard Cubs fans bypassed Wrigley Field to take in a White Sox game on the south side of town. **********''The exchanges have been the single most important group of institutions leading Chicago away from its history as hog butcher to the world,'' said Louis H. Masotti, a professor of management and urban affairs at Northwestern University's J. L. Kellogg School of Management. ''The investigation could be serious blow to the city's future as a financial center.'' Responses Closely Watched **********With so much at stake, the exchange's responses to the Federal investigation have been closely watched in Chicago. It was three weeks after the investigation was disclosed before Board of Trade officials agreed to be interviewed by the press. The Mercantile Exchange, by contrast, made officials available for comment from the start. **********Even when they did meet with reporters, Karsten Mahlmann, the Board of Trade's chairman, and Thomas R. Donovan, its president, were tight-lipped about the exchange's role in the investigation. At the Mercantile Exchange, Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee, tried to reduce public concern by openly discussing trading practices that were under scrutiny and possible changes in exchange operations. **********''Our decision to wait has been damaging to the image of the institution over the short term,'' said Raymond Carmichael, the Board of Trade's vice president of public relations. ''But the exchange has taken the moral high ground and preserved the presumption of innocence that we otherwise might have lost if we had moved more quickly.'' **********In addition, Mr. Melamed was a frequent visitor to the trading floor in the early days after the investigation's disclosure, answering questions from his members as well. Board of Trade officials, traders said, were not so visible. Likewise, while the Board of Trade has acceded to the United States Attorney's request to curtail its own investigation of the alleged wrongdoing, Mercantile Exchange officials say they are continuing their study for the sake of curbing any ongoing rule violations or criminal activity. Differences Reflect Roots **********The differences in styles between the two exchanges reflect their roots. **********The Board of Trade, the world's oldest and largest futures exchange, is an integral part of the city's history. Frank Norris, in his 1903 novel ''The Pit: A Story of Chicago,'' described it as ''some great, resistless force that held the tide of the streets within its grip, alternately drawing it in and throwing it forth.'' **********Indeed, each day, hundreds of brightly clad traders are pulled through the revolving doors of its building, seeking their fortunes by betting on the direction of commodity prices. Appropriately, a statue of Ceres, the Greek goddess of agriculture, overlooks the scene from the top of the Board of Trade's Art Deco building, at the corner of La Salle and Jackson Streets, the heart of Chicago's financial district. **********Many of the exchange's 3,400 members can count traders in their families several generations back, and the Board of Trade is often described as closely knit and tradition-bound. From its founding in 1848, it has been largely controlled by its powerful floor traders, like the grain trading firms, as opposed to the users of its markets.. **********The Board of Trade's leaders have frequently been called upon to convince the conservative floor members of the need for change. They have not always succeeded. The exchange was slow to introduce financial futures contracts, and as a result it lost a significant share of its market, as well as some of the younger and more boisterous members, to the Chicago Merc. **********Five blocks to the north, a modern steel and glass building, completed in 1983, stands as a testament to the huge market for financial futures that the Chicago Merc first tapped. **********The exchange, a descendant of the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, fell upon hard times in the late 1960's, after a scandal involving onion futures. At about that time, a group of young dissidents, led by a young lawyer, Mr. Melamed, sought to gain control of the exchange, which was then controlled by a small group of powerful and successful traders. Control Passed in 1969 **********With the help of an organization known as the Broker's Club, made up of 20 young traders, Mr. Melamed's group gained control of the board in 1969. At 37 years old, Mr. Melamed became one of the youngest chairmen in the exchange's history. **********Two years later, the United States decided to abandon the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which tied international currency rates to the dollar. Mr. Melamed and other exchange leaders quickly realized that if currencies were going to fluctuate in relation to the dollar, they could be traded on an exchange. They also felt that currency trading could be a boon to the second-largest commodities exchange. **********Mr. Melamed spent nine months convincing the membership that it was a good idea to trade the new contracts and regulators to give the Chicago Merc permission to trade currency futures in 1972. **********The popularity of these new contracts has spurred the Chicago Merc's remarkable growth since then. The exchange now has 2,500 members who traded 78 million contracts last year, almost 40 times the amount in 1970, when pork bellies were the exchange's major contract. **********The Board of Trade, which followed the Chicago Merc in 1975 by introducing Ginnie Mae futures, has also ridden the tide. It traded 118 million contracts last year, more than five times the amount a decade ago. Together, the two exchanges now account for about 40 percent of the world's futures and options trading, and provide jobs to roughly 30,000 people in the city. Building Boom Sparked **********The rising fortunes of the exchanges helped spark a building boom in the Loop, the city's historic commercial area, which is named after the train elevated tracks that girdle it. The exchanges have spent about $230 million to build and expand their own facilities in the last five years. Chic restaurants, glittering high-rise apartment buildings and opulent health clubs that cater to the area's growing ranks of traders have sprung up. **********Yet, because the growth of Chicago's downtown area has been so closely tied to that of the exchanges, some fear that the investigation could have a dramatic impact on the city's well-being. **********Neither exchange leader, of course, wants to see the juggernaut of growth that has made Chicago such an important financial center in the 1980's slowed. Yet each man's personality reflects the history and unique style of his exchange. **********Mr. Mahlmann, a German immigrant who arrived at the Board of Trade in 1957, armed only with a high school diploma and a letter of introduction from his father, a grain trader in Hamburg, runs the Board of Trade as if it were a private corporation, accountable to its members rather than the public at large. He is described as someone who has been able to build consensus among the exchange's outspoken and powerful members. $1 Million Plan Is Set Yet, because consensus has often been difficult to achieve at the Board of Trade, important decisions have been delayed. Indeed, after a series of early-morning meetings in response to the recent commodities investigation, the exchange's five-man executive committee finally recommended to the board that the exchange not ban dual trading, a practice that appears to be at the heart of the Federal investigation. Instead, it chose to spend $1 million to improve its audit and surveillance system and to toughen its disciplinary procedures. **********Two weeks earlier, the Merc, at Mr. Melamed's urging, had appointed a special panel of outside experts to study what changes needed to be made. The panel has met twice. The most important move that it is considering, Mr. Melamed said, is a ban on dual trading. **********Some experts suggest that the exchange's responses can be best understood in terms of their ages. ''It's almost a generational difference,'' one former industry official said. ''The Merc, because its membership is so much younger, has an autocratic style of government. It members look to Leo for direction. At the Board of Trade, the power is not concentrated in one person, and it takes far longer to build a consensus.'' **********But for both, observers say, the most important battle is still to come.

While Mr. Zhao's fate has not been entirely decided by the small circle of Chinese leaders led by Deng Xiaoping, most people in the central party apparatus expect that Mr. Zhao will be vigorously denounced but will not face a criminal trial. **********Although there has been no official announcement of the Central Committee meeting, officials and diplomats say that the agenda has been largely worked out and that officials are hammering out details of an economic plan to be approved at the meeting. 'Turning Point for China' **********''This will be a very important meeting, because it comes at a turning point for China,'' an Eastern European diplomat said. **********In the present environment of uncertainty and instability in China, with no clear political or economic direction, the meeting will be a closely watched indicator of who is in control and of what kind of policies are likely in the coming years. **********The meeting will be the first by the Central Committee, which includes 174 full members and 110 alternates, since a session in late June that formally dismissed Mr. Zhao and elected a new set of leaders. Officially, the meeting will be called the Fifth Plenum of the 13th Communist Party Central Committee. **********It will issue a ringing endorsement of the need for a continuation of China's open-door economic approach and other policies of change, Chinese officials say. But they add that aside from professions of reform, the main economic task will be approval of a detailed three-year retrenchment plan beginning this year and lasting through 1991. **********While the retrenchment began a year ago and was expected to be maintained for several more years, the focus on consolidation instead of change is unlikely to raise confidence among foreign investors. **********In part to reassure the world that China is maintaining its commitment to liberalization, some specific new changes are likely to be approved, officials say. Among them are price adjustments in some sectors, changes in the tax system and a realignment of the banking system. **********''We think that reform and retrenchment are inseparable,'' said Liu Guoguang, the vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and one of the nation's most influential economists. ''If we can't control inflation and the health of the economy, then we can't introduce new reforms, especially price reform.'' No Major Changes Seen **********Mr. Liu, who is an alternate member of the Central Committee, said in the interview that he had no information about the meeting or what policies would be adopted, but he suggested that there would be no major changes introduced in the next few years. **********''Right now we can't take a big step toward reform, because of the risk of inflation,'' Mr. Liu said. ''During the period of adjustment, only small steps can be taken. Then afterward we can take bigger steps.'' **********The retrenchment program will stress the need to reduce inflation, control investment and consumer spending, and increase roads and bridges and energy production, officials say. The central Government will try to regain some power and funds from the provinces and local governments, and a new system of taxation or financial quotas from local authorities is likely to raise funds for the central Government. **********The official Chinese-language newspaper Economic Information also suggested that the plan will involve some steps that most Western economists would regard as a retreat from the economic restructuring plan of the last decade. The newspaper said China would adjust the ratio of state companies to collective enterprises. This apparently means that the number of state-owned corporations will increase rather than diminish, as it has steadily in the last decade. No Bank 'Commercialization' **********The newspaper also said the Government would prevent the ''commercialization of banks,'' which seemed to mean that banks would be obliged to lend to state-owned companies instead of collectives, regardless of judgments about profitability and credit-worthiness. **********It was not clear from the article if these elements would be formally announced at the meeting, or if they would simply take shape over the next few years. **********Little real decision-making is expected during the meeting. The principal decisions will almost certainly have been made by the Politburo and by retired leaders well before the session opens. **********A Western diplomat said the meeting was also likely to be significant as a benchmark and a signal that the latest wave of repression could be eased somewhat. He said he planned to try to make contact with his Chinese friends after the meeting for the first time since the democracy movement was crushed in early June. **********There has been some speculation in Beijing, but no evidence, that Mr. Deng might use the meeting to announce his resignation from his last formal position, chairman of the Central Military Commission. Such an announcement, and in particular the decision about who would replace him, would be of enormous significance, but so far the talk seems to be more rumor than anything else."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/26/business/company-news-deal-for-hmss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deal for H.M.S.S.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Deal for H.M.S.S.", "body_text": " **********SecoAmerica Inc., a diversified services company that is the American arm of the Secom Company Ltd. of Japan, signed a definitive agreement to acquire H.M.S.S. for $50 a share, or $250 million, and said it would commence a tender offer later this week for the home health-care services company.

Botha Described as Upset **********According to a private briefing for caucus members afterward, Mr. Botha acted hurt and upset by their offer and said at first that he would not accept it. Later he promised to think about the proposal, the caucus participants were told. **********President Botha, who is now 73 years old, is recuperating from the stroke suffered on Jan. 18, which temporarily immobilized his left side. Though he quit as National Party leader five weeks ago, he has retained his executive powers as South Africa's head of state. **********In his absence, Mr. de Klerk, who will be 53 on March 18, quickly won support inside the party with his fresher, more collegial style and declared readiness to move ahead with evolutionary political changes of the apartheid system that would still protect the interests of the country's white minority. **********Nationalist M.P's increasingly felt that Mr. de Klerk should replace Mr. Botha as President, because the party leader has no authority on his own to execute party policy. Botha's Ouster Unlikely **********When Mr. Botha announced last week that he planned to resume his presidential duties later this month, and refused to rule out the prospect of a second term, it touched off a backlash in the party, as even normally obedient Afrikaans-language newspapers urged him to step down in favor of Mr. de Klerk. **********National Party legislators here say that it would be almost impossible to force Mr. Botha out, not only because the constitutional mechanisms are inadequate but also because such a move could embarrass and perhaps split the party.

The 1973 oil embargo in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, coupled with American regulatory overreaction, led to the first gasoline lines at the pumps since World War II and brought on our own kind of domestic energy warfare. **********Have we seen the last of gasoline lines? With inventories swollen recently and some members of OPEC in disagreement, one might think so. I don't and petroleum is my game. When it comes to energy policy in this country, we seem to be drifting in a sea of complacency. America reminds me of a giant cruise ship where the passengers are making merry, most of the crew is playing cards or watching TV, and the captain appears to be asleep on the bridge. **********Have we forgotten who controls the world's supply of crude oil? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now controls more than 660 billion barrels of proved reserves - 82 percent of the known oil in the non-Communist world. The United States has less than 5 percent of known reserves - about 25 billion barrels - and seems to care less about building them. Meanwhile, America's oil consumption is rising and production continues to drop. **********The gasoline shortfall hit overnight in 1973, yet at that time we relied on imported oil for 35 percent of our petroleum needs. This year, we will import 41 percent of our petroleum. And virtually all the studies I have seen predict that America's imports of oil will reach 50 percent or more by the mid-1990's, and perhaps sooner. **********Despite its internal bickering, in my opinion OPEC will regain control of the world's oil market. The Iran-Iraq war had been one of the causes of OPEC's division. But that war is over. Many analysts now even foresee the creation of a ''Super OPEC,'' with the first steps taken last May when OPEC members met for the first time officially with ministers of major non-OPEC producing countries like China, Mexico, Angola and Oman. The discussions will continue later this month in London. **********And while OPEC's power grows, the United States continues to play into OPEC's hands in a number of important ways. For example, we have declared some of America's most promising exploration areas - offshore California, for example, and parts of Alaska - off limits to new energy development. And we have kept price controls on certain categories of natural gas for 34 years, stimulating consumption while discouraging the development of new fields. **********As if these were not enough, our policy has been to relax the miles-per-gallon efficiency standards of new motor vehicles while allowing highway speed limits to be raised above 55 miles an hour. And we are on our way to halting nuclear power. **********We have also been binding the energy industry with complicated, costly and continually changing health, safety and environmental regulations. These are regulations that often go beyond all reason in an attempt to create a zero-risk society. And while we have been doing this, we have also cut back Federal support for research and development of energy alternatives while starting a wild goose chase for alcohol fuels. These policy mistakes are undoubtedly on any OPEC wish list. **********We are still in control of our own destiny, but barely. But what do we do? For one thing, it's time for a comprehensive national energy policy. Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now holds about 555 million barrels, is not enough. We need to do more. **********We can put pressure on OPEC by encouraging reasonable levels of petroleum exploration and development on Federal and state lands, including offshore areas. I make this statement because it is my contention that offshore oil rigs are environmentally safe, producing a fraction of the pollution that oil tankers do. Moreover, Government studies tell us that municipal and industrial waste-water discharges and runoffs bring 20 times as much pollution into our oceans as all offshore platforms combined. **********I would also decontrol all natural gas prices to encourage investment. And as a companion policy to price decontrol I would develop tax and regulatory policies that encourage energy exploration and research. **********It is also important to push development of the most promising and efficient alternative energy programs, like geothermal energy. **********But development of alternatives doesn't make sense without increasing both energy conservation and energy efficiency. We must begin to nurture a business environment that stimulates long-term planning and investment. **********The country now stands at a crossroads between energy security and economic insecurity. This nation cannot start pumping new oil supplies at a moment's notice.

To Meet With Bush **********''It makes Cristiani look like nothing more than a figurehead,'' said a Western diplomat, noting that the President-elect is to meet with President Bush in Washington next week. ''The judge tucked a grenade in his pocket and pulled the pin. Now we sit and see if it explodes.'' **********In his last decision before reassignment, the judge, Juan Hector Larios, ruled late on Friday that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the eight suspects. All are close associates of Roberto d'Aubuisson, the lifetime honorary president of the alliance, who has been linked repeatedly to the death squads that murdered thousands of leftists in the early 1980's. **********The ruling appeared to foreclose efforts to prosecute the case, which the United States had portrayed as proof of progress in its long effort to stengthen this country's politically sensitive judicial system. **********''The dismissal of these charges is a serious setback for human rights,'' said a spokesman for Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights monitoring group. ''It reminds us that there is many a slip between the cup and the lip when the wine is of military vintage.'' Ammunition for Critics **********Western diplomats said the ruling provided powerful ammunition to critics who charge that Mr. d'Aubuisson, a cashiered major, retains control of Arena, which swept to victory in the presidential elections last month. **********It was not possible to reach Mr. d'Aubuisson for comment. **********Senior aides to Mr. Cristiani said he was outraged by the judge's decision and promised a full investigation. They called it an attempt to ''sabotage'' the president-elect. **********''If somebody wanted to endanger U.S. aid, they couldn't have picked a better way,'' said an aide. **********A spokesman for the United States Embassy said he had not received a copy of the decision and declined to comment. **********Who controls the alliance is a key question for the Bush Administration. It will be almost impossible for the Administration to avoid a battle with Congress over aid if El Salvador is perceived as in the sway of extremists like Mr. d'Aubuisson. **********The kidnapping ring, whose members were said to have often posed as leftist guerrillas, was broken up three years ago. Prosecutors charged the defendants with kidnapping five wealthy businessmen between 1980 and 1985 for about $5 million in ransom. **********But their prosecution was delayed by the deaths of key witnesses and threats against court officers. Last year, Judge Jorge Alberto Serrano Panameno, who had initiated the case, was assassinated while taking his children to school. Defendants Ordered Released **********In his decision, Judge Larios ruled that statements from witnesses were not reliable and ordered the release of the defendants. They are Orlando Llovera Ballete, an industrialist; Jose Alfredo Jimenez Moreno, a former army major, and Rodolfo Lopez Sibrian, a former army lieutenant. **********Mr. Lopez Sibrian was also charged in the murder in 1981 of two Americans working on land redistribution, Mark David Pearlman of Seattle and Michael P. Hammer of Potomac, Md., and a Salvadoran official. But those charges were also dismissed for lack of evidence. **********The judge in the kidnapping case also dismissed arrest warrants for five other suspects in the case, including several former military officers who left the country hours before they were to be arrested and charged. **********The judge said his order could not be appealed. But a Government prosecutor said the decision could be reviewed and the charges reinstated.

Among the works affected are computer programs, fiction and nonfiction writing, advertising copy, drawings and photographs. **********''There is no way to guess how much money may be involved,'' said Richard Weisgrau, the executive director of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, an organization involved in the case. ''It may affect as much as 40 percent of all copyrighted work, according to some of the studies we have seen.'' Effect on Companies' Value **********Because a chief asset of many media companies has been copyrights to the material they distribute, the decision carries implications for the worldwide race to create vertically integrated media giants. By calling into question the ownership of much of that material, the decision may introduce uncertainties about the value of those companies, industry analysts said. **********But for all its impact, the decision settled only one skirmish in a full-scale war for control over intellectual property, say lawyers, academic experts and working professionals. **********''This is just a preliminary round in the battle over rights to intellectual material,'' said Paul Goldstein, a professor at Stanford University Law School who specializes in copyright issues. On another front are two as yet unresolved cases dealing with the colorization of motion pictures, Mr. Goldstein said. The conflict is likely to extend to other alterations of original works and to identification of authorship in the republication of material. **********On one side are major media companies eager to expand their right to reshape into new products the books, photographs, articles and other works they produce and distribute. On the other are independent professionals seeking to use rights of authorship acquired last year through the Bern copyright agreement to extend control over their work. **********Under last week's ruling, businesses that pay a fee to a freelance artist or writer obtain the right to reproduce the material only once, unless they specifically agree to another arrangement. Even after an author assigns all rights to a publisher, he may reclaim them and the rights to any material derived from the original work after 35 years. In the meantime, the creator of the work may retain certain rights to prevent alteration of the material. **********The ruling will probably apply to material published since the effective date of the present copyright law in 1978, as well as to material derived from it, Mr. Goldstein said. **********In the past, many publishers and other organizations had relied on the ''work for hire'' clause of copyright law in dealings with independent contractors. Under such arrangements, the freelance author or artist was considered an employee, with his work belonging to the company. **********The companies asserted that, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, they retained the rights to reuse the work, either by republishing it or by selling off certain derivative rights like the right to develop a movie from a news article. The decision made clear that the opposite was true. Unless there is an agreement showing otherwise, all rights revert to the creator. The Absence of Contracts **********Many major publications will not be affected by the ruling because they have routinely specified that they are acquiring only limited rights to material. But others, including many news organizations, computer software publishers and advertising agencies, have often operated without detailed agreements, assuming ownership for themselves. **********As an example of the ruling's effect, a freelance artist whose cover drawing a magazine acquired under a work-for-hire agreement, or for lack of an agreement, could claim that he is entitled to control over the reuse of the cover - in reprints and advertising, for example. In the future the publication could avoid problems by insisting on a written agreement specifying that it was acquiring all rights to the cover. But for past works the ownership would revert to the artist, who could then negotiate additional payments for his work or make use of it himself in other ways. **********As another example, a computer programmer hired on a freelance basis to produce software may find that he has retained the right to all later forms of the program derived from his work. And a film studio with a huge library of titles may find its copyrights open to challenge by independent screenwriters. **********Time Inc. has made no secret of the significance it places on its inventory of copyrights. The National Writers Union and other organizations that represent independent authors and journalists said last week that Time has often required its members to sign ''work for hire'' arrangements. Though their work was treated as if they were employees, they held no continuing legal interest in it. But as independent contractors they were not entitled to benefits like health insurance, vacations or unemployment compensation. Such arrangements were ruled invalid last week. Possibility of Disruption **********''There is potential for enormous disruption in what was thought to be a settled relationship,'' said Charles D. Ossola, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the case, the Copyright Justice Coalition and the American Society of Magazine Photographers. **********Because the United States last year became a signatory to the Bern Convention, an international agreement that defines the rights of authors and artists in their work, other aspects of copyright law are coming under scrutiny as well. The convention gives the creator of a work the right to prevent it from being distorted without permission and the right to insist that he be identified as its author"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/business/bank-of-japan-increases-rate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank of Japan Increases Rate", "print_headline": "Bank of Japan Increases Rate", "body_text": " **********The Bank of Japan said today that it had raised its discount rate to 3.75 percent, from 3.25 percent.

As an economics graduate from Yale, Mr. Ford's first job at Ford was as a member of the sales and advertising staff. He eventually ran the ill-fated Continental division in the 1950's, which was subsequently folded into Lincoln-Mercury. **********Despite the promise of an enhanced role for his son and nephew, Mr. Ford's exit from active management marks an incremental loosening of the Ford family's once tight control over the auto maker, a process that began when Henry Ford 2d retired as chief executive in 1979. A third brother, Benson Ford, was a vice president. He died in 1978. **********The retirement of Mr. Ford leaves the Ford family without a representative in the company's senior operating management for the first time since Henry Ford 2d took over as chief executive during World War II. **********Edsel Ford 2d, 40, is head of sales and marketing for Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division and William Clay Ford Jr., 31, run's the company's Ford of Switzerland subsidiary; both jobs are significant but lack policymaking power. **********The family's voting power derives from a special class of common stock that is worth eight times the normal vote. But only family members can hold the stock and once it is sold it reverts to normal voting status; therefore, the family's power has been slowly dwindling as family members die and their estates must sell stock to pay taxes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/02/business/the-media-business-high-court-to-consider-detroit-papers-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1989-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High Court to Consider Detroit Papers' Deal", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; High Court to Consider Detroit Papers' Deal", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to consider whether Detroit's two daily newspapers should be allowed to merge their business operations under an exemption from Federal antitrust law. **********The case is the first the Supreme Court has agreed to hear involving the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which permits such exemptions. **********A small group of readers, advertisers and employees of the two newspapers sued last year to block the proposed merger on the ground that it does not meet Federal standards for antitrust waivers. **********Because one of the parties in the deal, the Gannett Company, has refused to proceed until all legal issues are resolved, the court's acceptance of the case delays the combination until at least next year. **********The 18 joint operating agreements in place at other newspapers are not affected by the Detroit suit. Effects of a Merger **********The merger would place the advertising, circulation, printing and administrative functions of The Detroit Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and The Detroit News, a Gannett newspaper, under one corporate entity. It would end a decade of fierce competition that has helped keep subscription and advertising rates in Detroit among the lowest in the United States. **********The two newspapers would maintain separate news staffs that would produce independent newspapers five days each week. The staff of The News would prepare joint weekend editions.

Gannett has reported that The News has also lost money since the company acquired it in 1986. **********Last year, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d approved the deal over the objections of his staff and the recommendation of an administrative law judge. The Lawsuit's Arguments **********A group of 700 readers, advertisers and employees of the two newspapers, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, then sued to block the merger. The group was joined in its effort by Public Citizen, a public affairs group in Washington founded by Ralph Nader. **********For an exemption to be granted under the Newspaper Preservation Act, one newspaper must show that it will go out of business without a merger.

Limited Right of Appeal **********In a series of decisions dating to 1985, that court had upheld the regulators' view of their own powers, requiring creditors to submit claims to the F.S.L.I.C. with only limited right of appeal to Federal courts. **********Coit Independence Joint Venture, a real estate partnership that brought the issue to the Supreme Court, had borrowed $50 million from FirstSouth, a federally insured savings and loan, and had filed suit over the terms of the loan some two months before the Federal Home Loan Bank Board determined that the institution was insolvent and appointed the F.S.L.I.C. as receiver. **********Invoking the Fifth Circuit's doctrine that the F.S.L.I.C. had the exclusive right to resolve such claims, the agency persuaded the Federal District Court in Dallas to dismiss the suit. **********In its appeal, Coit argued both that Congress had never given the agency such sweeping powers and, alternatively, that such authority could not be constitutionally exercised. In Competition for Assets **********Coit argued that the F.S.L.I.C. could never be a truly disinterested judge, because by seeking to reimburse its insurance fund for the money paid out on insured accounts, the agency was in fact in competition with all other creditors for what remained of an institution's assets. **********Coit argued that this arrangement deprived it of constitutional due process and of the right to try its case before a jury. In addition, it argued that under the doctrine of separation of powers, Federal courts could not be foreclosed from hearing cases that would ordinarily be within their jurisdiction. **********The agency argued that it could not fulfill its duty to liquidate failed savings and loans ''in an orderly manner'' if it did not have the authority to subject all claims to its own centralized review process. Middle Position **********In defending the F.S.L.I.C. before the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General's office adopted something of a middle position, not subscribing to the agency's full view of its powers. **********The F.S.L.I.C. does not have exclusive jurisdiction over claims, the Solicitor General's office said, but it can require creditors to use the agency's administrative review process before taking a claim to Federal court. Justice O'Connor's opinion rejected this approach as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/business/business-people-post-of-tyco-president-added-by-grinnell-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Post of Tyco President Added by Grinnell Chief", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Post of Tyco President Added by Grinnell Chief", "body_text": " **********Tyco Laboratories Inc., a leading maker of fire protection systems, has named L.

Fromstein, president of the large international supplier of temporary help, spoke last week of a ''soft landing'' for the economy, not a recession, in 1990. **********Manpower, based in Milwaukee, surveyed the managers of more than 14,000 large and small businesses; it found that 65 percent planned no changes in staff size in the first quarter, while 20 percent said they expected to increase their work forces and 12 percent planned cutbacks. The percentages are strikingly similar to those that Manpower found a year ago. **********Mr. Fromstein's optimism comes at a time when many people in the New York City area are losing their jobs. Some 1,700 B. Altman & Company employees face unemployment when that retail chain ceases operations, and hundreds of workers on Wall Street are to be dismissed as Merrill Lynch & Company and other brokerage firms pare their operations. Many of the jobs cut in these corporate revampings are in middle management. **********Stressing geographic differences, Mr. Fromstein agreed that in the Northeast there would be an overall drop in hiring but that in some other regions staffing is expected to remain at or near the levels of 1989. **********''I would say that anything that looks encouraging like this study would apply to all levels of employment,'' Mr. Fromstein said. ''I am cautiously optimistic. What we don't know is if this hiring strength is driven by economic or demographic conditions.'' **********A similar view was expressed by the human resources outlook panel of the Conference Board, a New York-based research group that is supported by many corporations. Audrey Freedman, management counselor of the Conference Board and author of many of its reports, summed up the main finding at a recent panel discussion: the economy will avoid a recession next year. **********She also emphasized the panel's prediction that ''labor shortages will force companies to hire individuals they would not have employed previously.'' This group of potential workers includes women and recent immigrants. **********One panelist, Irving Margol, who is executive vice president, management services group, of Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles, said the bank had been advertising for workers in foreign-language newspapers as well as on foreign-language radio and television stations. **********''We are also recruiting at shopping malls, sporting events and putting up signs in buses,'' he said. **********The obvious conclusion is that companies will be forced to spend more time and dollars not only on recruitment, but also on training newcomers. Training for specific jobs is already a growth industry. **********In a telephone interview, Mr. Fromstein spoke about companies' growing demand for Manpower to train their employees. ''We have trained about 285,000 workers, including our own temporaries as well as permanent employees of many of our customers,'' he said. **********Training takes on even more importance as corporate managers realize that the United States ''cannot remain competitive without raising productivity of its workers,'' said Mrs. Freedman of the Conference Board. Higher productivity requires lowering costs through more efficient production. ''Only better management of resources - human and capital - can improve it,'' she said. **********In a Conference Board study issued a few weeks ago, Mrs. Freedman warned that the nation's living standards would decline in the next decade unless companies raise their productivity. **********Manufacturing productivity will continue to rise, advancing about 3 percent in 1990, Mrs. Freedman predicted - a figure in line with annual increases during the 1980's. Agriculture, too, can be counted on to increase productivity in the 1990's in areas like grains, cotton, tobacco, vegetables and fruit, said Mrs. Freedman, who added that telecommunications would be the ''brightest spot'' with annual increases of about 4 percent. **********But she estimated that productivity would grow by ''less than 2 percent a year'' in the 1990's in the service industries, like retailing, real estate and professional services. **********Among the barriers to productivity gains, Mrs. Freedman said, are failure to communicate with workers, inefficient use of technology, bureaucratic stifling of creativity, and managements that seek to cement their control over a company rather than develop entrepreneurial strategies.Blue Arrowd(manpower)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/16/world/successor-to-finance-chief-of-argentina-takes-office.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Successor to Finance Chief Of Argentina Takes Office", "print_headline": "Successor to Finance Chief Of Argentina Takes Office", "body_text": " **********Nestor Rapanelli was sworn in today as the fifth economy minister in 3 1/2 months, and he pledged to complete the austerity program of Miguel Roig, who died only six days after taking office. **********Mr. Rapanelli, 60 years old, was vice president of the Bunge and Born grain conglomerate.

Gorbachev moved today to prevent further outbreaks of labor unrest by offering restive workers a chance to take out their fury on local party, government and union officials. **********The Soviet leader reversed an earlier decision to postpone countrywide elections for local government councils until 1990, proposing instead that each republic decide on its own when to take this critical next step in the spread of democracy. **********Early local elections have been a key political demand of striking coal miners, who say they have no faith in the city and regional officials named to their posts before the advent of competitive ballots. **********The Soviet leader also called for extraordinary meetings of local Communist Party committees, Government councils and trade union organizations to hear the complaints of workers and consider their demands, including the ouster of unresponsive party and Government leaders. Welcomes Workers' Help **********While Mr. Gorbachev may have misgivings about a rampant labor movement, he clearly welcomes the workers' help in dislodging the vast network of conservative party and Government functionaries whom he has identified as a drag on his program. **********During a meeting of party leaders last week, the Soviet leader called for a sweeping ''renewal'' of party personnel from the shop floor to the ruling Politburo to help the party recover some of its dwindling authority. His comments today indicated that this renewal would be at least partly a purge from below, driven by angry workers. **********Mr. Gorbachev spoke at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, where grim coal-region legislators described the strikes as a national ''scream of despair'' and predicted ''a chain reaction'' of walkouts in other industries. Gorbachev's Strategy **********In essence, the Soviet leader was trying to co-opt the strikers, and potential strikers in other industries, into his campaign for change by inviting them to take part in a housecleaning of the local bureaucracy that is blamed for retarding economic change. **********If he succeeds, he could at a stroke defuse the most serious labor unrest since the 1920's and enlist a potent new grass-roots force behind the social restructuring he calls perestroika. **********But it is not clear that Mr. Gorbachev's strategy will be enough to contain the cascade of frustration pouring forth from the country's workers. **********At the Supreme Soviet today, coal-region legislators said some strikers have even more ambitious political demands, including free trade unions, partial cancellation of the elections held in March, and constitutional changes to limit the role of the Communist Party. **********Another looming problem is the cost of satisfying the immediate economic demands of the strikers. **********Viktor G. Kucherenko, the chairman of the legislature's new Planning and Budget Commission, said in an interview today that the price of promised pay increases, housing and consumer goods for coal miners alone could add 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion at the official exchange rate) to the country's crushing budget deficit. **********Strikers in most of the major coal regions have begun returning to work after the wildcat walkouts that paralyzed the coal industry for two weeks, but some are holding out for additional concessions and for clearer guarantees that the Government's promises will be honored. Strike in the Ukraine **********About half of the 125 mines in the Donets Basin in the Ukraine, the country's largest coalfield, remained idle today as miners awaited the outcome of a meeting in Moscow between a strike delegation and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. **********Work was reported back to normal in the Kuznets Basin of western Siberia and the Karaganda pits of Central Asia, but the Soviet press and local officials said the walkout continued in the Pechora coalfields of the far north and in the Pavlograd and Voroshilovgrad regions of the Ukraine. **********The strikes have already given birth to a fledgling movement for independent labor organizations to replace the official unions that are widely despised as an arm of management. **********Aleksei N. Boiko, a Supreme Soviet member from Donetsk, said in an interview today that strikers in that coal center had been given complete control over the organization of special local union elections two weeks from now, at which the strike organizers are expected to take control of the management-dominated locals. **********''We should have independent organizations that protect the interests of the workers, which the current trade unions do not protect,'' said Mr. Boiko, an economist elected in March on a platform of change. **********Since Soviet industry is all state-owned, the strikers have broadened their demands far beyond the call for better union representation to include accelerated elections and more local economic autonomy. **********They want local officials who will demand that profits be plowed back into the local communities and laws that will loosen the grip of the Communist Party apparatus and industrial ministries in Moscow. New Powers to the Soviets **********The housecleaning that Mr. Gorbachev seeks would be accomplished by giving workers a voice in a special round of party meetings at all levels and partly through the election of local government councils, or soviets, which are to be given extensive new powers. **********Local elections were originally planned for this fall but were postponed until next year, in part because local Communist officials feared certain embarrassment. **********At the Supreme Soviet session today, one member after another took the podium to declare support for the strikers and to echo their demands for early elections to restore confidence in local leadership. **********''The people have been driven to the streets not by a deficit of soap, but by a deficit of justice,'' Mr. Boiko told the legislators. ''The miners of Donetsk trust nobody and nothing.'' **********Vladimir Lushnikov, a member from the Russian far north, read a statement from Pechora miners demanding even more far-reaching changes in the Soviet political system. **********The demands included scrapping of Article Six of the Soviet Constitution, which establishes the Communist Party as the ''leading and guiding force'' in Soviet society, and new elections to replace members of the Supreme Soviet who were chosen by official organizations like the party rather than by voters at large. **********Mr. Gorbachev said the strikes also demonstrated the need for the legislature to give a number of planned economic laws top priority, including new laws on property ownership and land use, taxes, trade unions and strikes. **********To soothe the discontent of an estimated 20 million citizens who live in poverty, he said a pension increase promised for January would be put into effect on Oct. 1, with the extra three months' payments taken partly from dues collected by the Communist Party and trade unions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/24/world/offer-by-argentine-leftist-rebels-gift-of-ransom.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1989-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offer by Argentine Leftist Rebels: Gift of Ransom", "print_headline": "Offer by Argentine Leftist Rebels: Gift of Ransom", "body_text": " **********When Fernando Vaca Narvaja and Roberto Perdia stepped off a hydrofoil boat from Uruguay last month, they looked like two of the well-dressed businessmen who regularly commute to Argentina. **********As they made the rounds here - the presidential palace, television talk shows and news conferences - they sounded like would-be foreign investors or representatives of a generous foundation. **********That's somewhat the way the two former leftist guerrillas see themselves. **********They say they have access to some of the $60 million that their organization, the Montoneros, collected in the kidnapping of two businessmen brothers, Juan and Jorge Born, in 1974. They propose putting the money to work to help President Carlos Saul Menem rebuild the Argentine economy. They talk of creating several hundred thousand jobs. **********Asked on a television program whether the money ought not be returned to the Born brothers, Mr. Vaca Narvaja said, ''No Argentine is going to oppose using all his resources to change the country.'' He added that the Montoneros' proposal was a guarantee that they intended to be part of the nonviolent political scene. Some Rebels Were Pardoned **********The presidential pardons issued by Mr. Menem for a group of former guerrillas and military men accused of slayings and torture in the 1970's permitted Mr. Vaca Narvaja, 41 years old, and Mr. Perdia, 48, to come home after a dozen years in exile in such places as Nicaragua, Cuba and the Middle East. **********The two men were part of the top leadership of the Montoneros and are believed to have ranked just below Mario Firmenich, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence. Mr. Firmenich was extradicted from Brazil by the Government of former President Raul Alfonsin and tried and convicted for directing the Born kidnapping, in which two bodyguards were killed. Mr. Menem has considered pardoning Mr. Firmenich as well, but so far has not done so. **********The Montoneros, a radical leftist offshoot of the generally right-wing Peronist Party - Mr. Menem's own - abducted people for ransom and attacked police posts in an attempt to set off an insurrection in the early and mid-1970's. The armed forces responded with a brutal crackdown against suspected leftists - the so-called Dirty War - that took about 9,000 lives. **********Aside from the $60 million collected from the Born family, no estimates have been made as to how much the Montoneros may have collected. A number of the victims of abductions were slain, but it has always been rumored that many other kidnappings or threats of kidnappings were settled by payments without publicity. Access May Be Complicated **********However, access to the money may be more complicated than the returning Montoneros have suggested. **********One roadblock is a recent decision by a federal judge in Buenos Aires to block payment of nearly $15 million to the heirs of David Graiver, a banker and financial speculator believed to have died in a plane crash in Mexico in 1976, on the ground that part of the Born ransom had been deposited with Mr. Graiver by the Montoneros. **********Mr. Graiver, an operator in the shadowy world of financial speculation in Buenos Aires, was rumored at the time to be a banker for the rebels. After his presumed death - the body was never identified - the military Government confiscated his assets, including a newspaper and about $60 million, because of the suspected guerrilla ties. **********After Mr. Alfonsin took office in 1983, the Graiver family began legal action to recover the money. Mr. Graiver's widow, brother and other relatives maintained they had no knowledge of his ever accepting money from the Montoneros to invest. Eventually, the newspaper and $30 million were returned. The rest of the money was to be returned in a series of future payments, the first of which was to have been last month. **********But when a federal prosecutor in the investigation of a man accused of having been the Montoneros chief financial officer asserted that the money in question came from the Born kidnapping, the court blocked the payment. **********Mr. Vaca Narvaja and Mr. Perdia have not said whether Mr. Graiver had the Montonero money. But court prosecutors say they have obtained such statements from other Montoneros under investigation. **********There are also suggestions - disclosed by Argentina intelligence organizations but not confirmed or denied by the returning Montoneros -that some of their money is deposited in a bank in Cuba. **********But since 1984, when the Montoneros engaged in a public ''self-criticism'' and decided to reject the concept of armed struggle, the former guerrilla group has not had friendly relations with Fidel Castro. That is expected to make it difficult to free any money deposited in Cuba."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/world/france-bans-imports-of-ivory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France Bans Imports of Ivory", "print_headline": "France Bans Imports of Ivory", "body_text": " **********France is banning imports of ivory to help save African elephants, the Government announced today.

Mr. Wolf, who is 47 years old, is the first Chiat chief who was not a founder of the agency, and the first who does not come from a creative background. **********''There's certainly a faith on the part of Jay and the rest of the company that this 'outsider,' this nonfounder, this noncreative is not going to change the creative course of this agency,'' Mr. Wolf said on Friday in a conversation in Chiat's New York office. ''One of my highest priorities will be to see we remain the pre-eminent creative agency.'' **********Still, Mr. Wolf's promotion will mean obvious changes in the firm that opened and closed the decade with its designations as Advertising Age's ''agency of the year.'' **********Mr. Chiat, 57, will be less of a daily presence in his agency's four full-service North American offices, as he spends more time integrating its Asian and Pacific offices into the company and presides over its expansion in Europe. **********The agency will also place increasing emphasis on attracting large clients, Mr. Wolf said, especially soft drink, beer, telecommunications and airline companies that can spend $50 million to $100 million annually promoting themselves. **********Mr. Wolf added that the agency will strive harder to retain those accounts once they land in Chiat's roster. He predicted that the 1990's will see fewer of the big client resignations, like the defections of Apple, Pizza Hut and Nike that rocked the agency during the 1980's. **********''We learned you have to provide more all-around service,'' he said. ''You can't live or die on your last ad. You have to add value beyond the ads.'' **********But creativity will continue to be Chiat's strength and goal, affirmed Mr. Wolf, who despite New York's frigid weather was dressed California casually - in jeans, an open-collar blue-and-white-striped shirt and a double-breasted blue blazer. **********Unlike other reputable creative agencies that start seeking the stability of large packaged-goods accounts as they grow, Chiat professes limited interest in such clients. ''We wouldn't turn down packaged-goods advertising, but with those clients, the journey is more important than the reward,'' Mr. Wolf said.  It is a subject he knows well. After receiving a master's degree in business administration from Adelphi University, Mr. Wolf joined Lever Brothers, where he became a brand manager on Wisk, among other products. In 1971, he went to Wells, Rich, Greene, where he remained for 12 years, working on the Procter & Gamble account and rising to general manager of its Los Angeles office. **********After a brief stint at Kenyon & Eckhardt, he came to Chiat in 1983 to head its fledgling New York office. Once losing about $1 million annually, it is today the only successful New York branch of an out-of-town agency, most advertising consultants say. **********Like others at Chiat, creative and noncreative types alike, Mr. Wolf seems driven to produce advertising that is noticed, talked about and applauded. He conceded that ''deep down, anybody who's going to be good in this business has to be a frustrated creative.'' **********Because of Mr. Wolf's ascension, Bob Kuperman, 48, creative director of Chiat in Los Angeles, is being promoted to president and chief executive of that office, the position Mr. Wolf has held since 1987. Steve Rabosky, 36. will become creative director in Los Angeles. **********Mr. Chiat said he will be spending more time on what he called ''environmental management.'' **********''It means culturally and architecturally, we can grow this place without compromising our values,'' he said. **********Mr. Chiat was not expressing a California ''new age'' philosophy. He was heading to London to meet with an architect to discuss the redesign and expansion of his agency's office there."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/30/business/l-corporate-humor-190889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corporate Humor", "print_headline": "Corporate Humor", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I read with interest ''What's New in Stand-Up Comedy'' (April 9), especially when it concerned the role of comedy in the workplace. **********As a psychologist and consultant, I have seen many instances of humor having positive effects on morale and productivity at work.

By comparison, it rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and the same in 1988. **********Inflationary spirals, however, cannot last long, most economists believe, unless they are fed by widespread wage increases that keep forcing up prices -and also produce enough income for consumers to afford the higher prices. Wage Pressures Possible **********Wage pressures might yet show up. Employment costs are rising. But so far evidence of wage pressures on prices is hard to find, with the notable exception of health care, where big raises for nurses, medical technicians and numerous others contributed to the 7 percent rise last year in the cost of medical care. **********And evidence of price resistance is widespread. ''I do not think that people will stop buying,'' said Florence Skelly, of the Daniel Yankelovich Group, which surveys consumers. ''But there is a real focus to their buying. If they see an item they want, they'll wait two weeks for it to go on sale.'' **********Quite apart from this resistance, two companies, the Dow Chemical Company and the Union Camp Corporation, illustrate how makers of basic materials manage big price increases, and how they justify them. **********In Dow's case, the price index for its array of chemical products rose 14 percent in 1988, but Paul Oreffice, the company's chairman, said the large increase only restored the index to its 1981 level. Partly because of the strong dollar in the early 1980's, Dow had to lower its prices to compete in world markets; now it is able to do the opposite - raise them and still not charge as much in dollars as foreign competitors do. No Longer in Short Supply **********In the absence of much foreign competition, will there be more price increases now that Dow is once again earning a healthy 15 percent on its invested capital? Mr. Oreffice says no. For one thing, many chemicals are no longer in short supply, as they were until recently. And Dow is not facing wage or other cost pressures, Mr. Oreffice said. ''Three percent would be a good estimate for the increase in our price index this year,'' he said. **********Similarly, Union Camp and other producers are raising by 7 percent - effective today - the price of linerboard, which is used to make heavy shipping cartons. **********The linerboard increase, to $440 a ton, comes on top of an 8 percent rise last March, but it only brings Union Camp's prices and profit margins into line with early 1980's levels, said Raymond O. Cartledge, the company's chief executive. Linerboard prices had plunged to $250 in 1985 because the strong dollar had made American linerboard uncompetitive on world markets. **********Mr. Cartledge, however, does not see further big increases on the horizon. Neither labor costs (Union Camp's 6,000 mill workers have been getting 3 percent annual wage increases) nor other costs are rising sufficiently to force another price rise, he said. **********But while Mr. Oreffice and Mr. Cartledge do not see cost pressures, the users of their products - and of other basic materials - certainly do. The General Electric Company, for example, manufactures refrigerators with steel (up 6.6 percent in 1988), copper (up 27 percent), aluminum (up more than 20 percent) and plastics (up 18 percent) - and then ships them in boxes made with linerboard. Price Rise Did Not Stick **********But an attempt to lift prices for major appliances by 3 percent last February did not stick, in part because other makers did not follow suit. Last fall the increase did finally take hold. ''By that time our competitors were also hurting on costs,'' said Walter Joelson, G.E.'s chief economist. The consumer no longer had a choice. **********''You can absorb increases up to a point and then you can't do it any more,'' said Craig Howell, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which puts out data on consumer and producer prices. ''I don't think the price pass-through is over,'' he said, ''but how much longer it will go on is hard to know.'' **********Other special factors are also at work. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, have raised prices on brand-name prescription drugs by 7 percent a year for several years. This is partly because one company is the only supplier of each brand-name drug and the demand for prescription drugs, particularly among the elderly, is on the rise. **********In addition, changes in patent law practice allow makers of generic drugs to acquire the right to market their versions of brand-name drugs sooner. As a result, pharmaceutical companies keep raising prices to earn more in shorter periods. Consumer Resistance **********Nevertheless, drugstores are not able to recover all of the price increases from health insurance payments or from cash customers, said Bruce Briggs of the National Association of Chain Drugstores. In fact, consumer resistance is so strong that prices of aspirin, shampoo, toothpaste and shaving cream, also on drugstore shelves, have not risen at all in the last year. The bottom line is that profit margins for drugstores are squeezed, Mr. Briggs said. **********The Steeltin Can Corporation in Baltimore is also feeling the price resistance - mostly from companies that buy from Steeltin to package vegetables and other foods. Steel represents 60 percent of the company's costs, and with steel prices up sharply, the family-owned concern scheduled a 7 percent price rise for Jan. 1, the first in more than a year. **********The company had tried to raise the price by this percentage last summer and again in the fall, but had to put it off. ''We are in the middle of getting this one accepted,'' said Jay M. Wilson, Steeltin's president. ''We have had a difficult time because lurking in the background is plastic as an alternative.'' Rising plastics prices are eliminating this alternative. **********The Government's statistics also indicate that the spurt in the inflation rate in January might not be repeated in coming months. The Consumer Price Index, which rose at an average monthly rate of four-tenths of 1 percent last year, suddenly jumped by six-tenths of 1 percent in January, but some of that rise may be the result of faulty formulas used to adjust for seasonal price variations. Data Skewed Somewhat **********The big price increases involving cars, tobacco, entertainment and gasoline might be somewhat skewed because of this, said Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More accurate adjustment might have shaved the total January increase from a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent down to five-tenths or four-tenths, Mr. Jackman said. **********What is more, Robert Bretz of the National Association of Purchasing Management argues that the steady increases in materials prices of the last year have finally peaked. He cites as evidence the monthly survey of 250 corporate purchasing executives, which he is in charge of conducting. The survey is closely watched as a leading indicator of economic trends, and the February results, to be published on Monday, are expected to show a slackening in price increases. **********But Mr. Bretz's survey leaves open the possibility that the price rise of materials in the last year will still find their way into consumer prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/01/business/jury-selection-to-begin-in-bilzerian-securities-fraud-case.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1989-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 635, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jury Selection to Begin in Bilzerian Securities-Fraud Case", "print_headline": "Jury Selection to Begin in Bilzerian Securities-Fraud Case", "body_text": " **********Jury selection will begin today in the first case against a takeover artist since the recent wave of Wall Street scandals began. **********Paul A. Bilzerian, the Florida investor who gained control of the Singer Company last year, is charged with 11 counts of violating securities and tax laws by failing to disclose his stock holdings. One of the 12 original charges against him has been dropped. The securities-fraud case is being tried in Federal District Court in Manhattan. **********The Government plans to argue that Mr. Bilzerian, who is 38 years old, made millions of dollars by accumulating stock in target companies while hiding his ownership through secret accounts at Jefferies & Company, a large West Coast brokerage, and then selling the stock after its price had risen. In addition, the Government will argue that Mr. Bilzerian hid his ownership to avoid taxes. Focus on Trades in 4 Companies **********Mr. Bilzerian, who has tried to take over several companies, captured widespread attention when he bought Singer for $1.03 billion early last year. He became chairman of the company after the takeover. None of the charges involve the Singer acquisition; the case focuses on trading involving Cluett, Peabody & Company, the H. H. Robertson Company, the Hammermill Paper Company and Armco Inc. **********Mr. Bilzerian's trial is likely to test further the credibility of Boyd L. Jefferies, a chief Government witness in several securities fraud cases and founder of the Jefferies brokerage. **********Defense lawyers are expected to attack Mr. Jefferies, arguing that he has provided misleading information to the Government and that he is unreliable. The California broker began cooperating with the Government in 1987 after pleading guilty in two felony securities cases. **********Earlier this year, Mr. Jefferies was the central witness in the stock manipulation trial of the GAF Corporation and one of its top executives. That case ended once in a mistrial and had a deadlocked jury in the second trial. **********Several jurors in the GAF trials have said they questioned Mr. Jefferies's credibility. Indeed, damaging information disclosed during his cross-examination in the GAF trial is expected to be brought forth in the Bilzerian trial. Another Potential Witness **********At least one other Jefferies employee is expected to be an important witness in the case. Michael Landy, the principal account executive at Jefferies who dealt with Mr. Bilzerian on three of the four questioned transactions, has been named in court papers as a likely witness. **********Arthur F. Mathews, Mr. Bilzerian's lawyer, is expected to argue that the Florida investor is being prosecuted for activities that have never been tried in criminal cases but have been dealt with in civil cases. **********Almost all the charges against Mr. Bilzerian involve violations of laws requiring disclosure of stock holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. has not brought civil charges against Mr. Bilzerian, but court papers indicate that it is conducting an investigation. **********Last spring the S.E.C. filed papers stating that it was examining whether Edward DeBartolo Sr., the nation's largest developer of shopping centers, had helped Mr. Bilzerian to accumulate stock secretly in takeover targets. Such information is expected to be examined during the criminal trial. **********Mr. DeBartolo has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and the investigation of him was suspended indefinitely earlier this year after he agreed to cooperate with the S.E.C.'s inquiry into Mr. Bilzerian's activities. Mr. DeBartolo is expected to testify in the case, but the primary witness regarding his company's transactions is expected to be William Moses, an executive with the Edward J.

The developers, the Kirschner Companies of Norwalk, Conn., will have 48 hours after the auction to accept or reject the final price reached on each of the remaining 39 units. **********Since the 174-unit, $40 million project opened three years ago, some 80 identical two- and three-bedroom units have been sold at prices ranging from $219,000 to $375,000. The developers say they will be content to get 75 to 85 percent of the original prices at auction. **********The auction, one of several taking place along the East Coast, reflects the rapid downturn in the volume of residential sales during the last two years. The weak market has created such serious financial problems for some builders that unorthodox methods like auctions are being adopted. **********Within the next six weeks, for example, the same auctioneers, Sheldon Good & Company of Chicago, will auction condominum units at Pointe Rok Estates in Worcester, Mass., and the Skyline in Hoboken, N.J., among other projects in the Northeast. **********Industry analysts attribute the difficulties at Four Beaches to high-cost construction at this rocky waterfront site and the difficulties that its projected buyers - affluent empty-nesters - have been facing in trying to sell their homes. **********''The essential problem is one of gridlock,'' said John Scott, president of Scott Fitton & Company of New Haven, market analysts for the developers. ''The kind of people who have the money to buy at Four Beaches and who are attracted to this type of living are the sort who need to sell before they can buy. They are also discretionary buyers. They don't have to move now. And most would rather wait out this slowdown than rush to reduce the price on their existing home.'' **********Sales volume in New Haven County, the site of Four Beaches, has fallen by 50 percent from its 1986 peak. For example, only 1,374 units were sold in the second quarter of 1988, compared with 2,306 in the comparable period in 1986, according to the Connecticut Association of Realtors. **********The market weakness is also affecting planning for new projects. Figures from the Connecticut Department of Housing show that the number of building permits issued in April was the lowest for the month since 1982. **********Steven L. Good, president of Sheldon Good, cited the large overhead that the Kirschner Companies must carry as inventory mounts at this $40 million project - debt service payments, property taxes on the completed units, insurance and maintenance. The property, jutting out into Long Island Sound, includes private beaches, a pool, two tennis courts, a visitor's dock and plank boardwalks. **********Robert W. Scott, marketing director of the New Homes division of the Beazley Company Realtors of New Haven, said that the completion of new units at most town-house condominium developments could be delayed when the market was weak. But Four Beaches, with a midrise design, required a commitment to 40 to 50 units for each phase. Moreover, he said, there are several competing projects within a few miles. **********The Kirschner Companies, one of Connecticut's best-known developers, has built 3,500 housing units in the state over 40 years. Nolan Kirschner, the president, is known for his innovative approach to marketing during tough times. He gave away a condominium unit as a lottery prize in Wallingford in 1981 when the market was similarly quiet. **********''That lottery encouraged 4,000 people to come and look at what we were doing,'' Mr. Kirschner said. ''And 12 stayed around to buy.'' **********Today he sees an auction as generating equal excitement without forcing him to reduce prices permanently at the project.

The lawmakers lost enthusiasm in part because the market for such transactions has weakened, but for political reasons as well. **********Within the Administration, concern about the economic and social costs of rapidly growing corporate debt has been outweighed by the antipathy of top officials toward Government regulation of the markets. Without a change of heart in the Administration, Congress seems unlikely to move further. **********In a leveraged buyout, the hottest ticket on Wall Street through most of the 1980's, a group of investors using borrowed money, generally acquired by issuing high-yielding ''junk bonds'' to investors, buys the controlling stock of a company, often in cooperation with its top managers. **********Early this year, during a flurry of hearings by several Congressional committees, one economist after another warned that such transactions threatened to unbalance the nation's corporate structure and could lead to a raft of bankruptcies in the event of a recession. 'Significant Dangers' Cited **********For example, Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant whose views are valued on Capitol Hill, told one committee that leveraged buyouts posed ''significant dangers to the economic and financial well-being of this country.'' **********The legislators became concerned in part because they feared that the companies involved might be unable to make debt payments in a recession or a business slump. They also worried that fear of being taken over would cause managers to focus only on short-term profits and that, in the event of a buyout, businesses would close or relocate and constituents' jobs would be lost. **********But in the end, Congress failed to act this year, largely for these reasons: *********** Many lawmakers believe the markets are correcting the problems on their own, as several buyout deals have faltered since spring and investments in junk bonds have dwindled. *********** Despite a nearly universal view that the tax code unfairly rewards borrowing and penalizes investments in stock, neither the legislators nor their expert staffs could devise a correction that would not cause new and probably more serious problems. *********** Lawmakers were cowed by the possibility that the stock market would plunge and that they would be blamed as they were in 1987, when approval by the House Ways and Means Committee, without debate, of a measure that would have limited some tax advantages of leveraged buyouts was seen by some as a reason for the October market crash. *********** Buyout deal makers lobbied heavily against further regulation and contributed generously to political campaigns, while no forceful lobby arose on the other side. *********** The most influential legislators became absorbed with other issues, including capital gains taxes, air pollution and public disclosure of takeover deals. Elsewhere in the capital, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating who issues, buys and defaults on junk bonds, officials said, but stiff new regulations do not seem to be in the offing. **********The new S.E.C. chairman, Richard C. Breeden, has declined to take a strong position on the question of leveraged buyouts. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who has expressed concern in the past about leveraged buyouts, told a Senate subcommittee recently that he expected them to become ''a thing of the past.'' He urged Congress to ''see what the market has produced as a cure'' before taking action. 'I Have Not Given Up' **********Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, a senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, reflected the view of most lawmakers. ''We won't move in this area without active involvement by the Administration,'' he said. **********Some strong opponents of leveraged buyouts are determined to press their case again next year. ''I have not given up,'' said Representative Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat. ''This is a very troublesome problem, and eventually we're going to have to deal with it.'' **********But Mr. Dorgan agreed that he was unlikely to succeed as long as the Bush Administration was so adamantly opposed to action in this area. **********Congress did take some minor steps this year, none of which is likely to have a significant effect on leveraged buyouts. The law to rescue failed savings and loan institutions prohibits such institutions from investing in junk bonds. The overall budget bill now before a House-Senate conference, would limit interest deductions for a particular kind of junk bond, similar to a zero-coupon bond. **********In addition, the House last week passed a bill that would require the Secretary of Transportation to reject any airline buyout that he found to be contrary to the public interest because it would affect safety, hinder competition, cost jobs or result in foreign control of the carrier. Modest Measures Pending **********A similar measure has been approved by a Senate committee. But Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has opposed the legislation, and President Bush might veto it. Even if it becomes law, experts believe the measure would have little effect, given Mr. Skinner's opposition. **********Other modest measures that may be enacted this year would restrict certain pension money from being invested in junk bonds and limit leveraged buyout companies from collecting refunds of back taxes because of operating losses resulting from some debt payments. **********Corporate restructuring in general and leveraged buyouts in particular have shaken American business in recent years. According to the Treasury, the value of debt-financed takeovers was $160 billion from 1983 to 1988, 15 times their value in the previous five years. Although Congress periodically debated the trend, it was not until the biggest leveraged buyout ever, the $25 billion RJR Nabisco Inc. deal at the start of this year, that prominent lawmakers expressed a determination to act. 'Congress Went Galloping' **********''After RJR Nabisco, Congress went galloping,'' said Bartlett Naylor, a former staff assistant on the Senate Banking Committee and now a senior analyst at the Investor Responsibility Research Center. ''Congress went galloping. That one seemed to be an awful expression of greed.'' For example, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the firm that put together the deal to buy RJR Nabisco, made $75 million in fees on the deal, almost as much as its stake in the investment pool that bought the company. **********Early this year, Jim Wright, then Speaker of the House, called together a half dozen of the most influential House committee chairmen and urged them to begin work on legislation to limit leveraged buyouts and the junk bonds that finance them. **********At first, the new Bush Administration did not discourage the lawmakers. At a news conference a week before his inauguration, Mr. Bush suggested that changes in the tax laws governing such deals might be needed, and Mr. Brady worried that too much of the country's talent and resources were wasted on ''financial engineering.'' **********Congress began work on two fronts, taxes and regulation. Twice-Taxed Dividends **********On taxes, politicians and academic experts agree that the law's favorable treatment of debt and unfavorable treatment of equity are engines that propel leveraged buyouts and ought to be corrected. **********Companies financed with borrowed money can deduct the interest payments they make to bondholders and other creditors. But companies financed with equity, or stock, cannot deduct their dividend payments. The dividends are, in effect, taxed twice: once when they are counted in the profits on which corporate taxes are based and again when they are counted as income to stockholders. **********''From a tax-policy standpoint, anyone would say that the right policy is to have a level playing field for debt and equity,'' said Robert J. Leonard, chief counsel of the Ways and Means Committee and one of the top tax experts among Congressional staff members. **********There were large obstacles, however, to policies that sought to correct the problem. **********Taxing debt would put American investors at a serious competitive disadvantage with those from abroad, where interest payments are generally deductible. Moreover, since most corporate borrowing is an essential business expense unrelated to takeovers, a change in the tax law to limit junk bonds would require different treatment for different forms of debt. ''We could not find a way to attack the cancer cells without damaging the healthy ones,'' a Congressional tax specialist said. No Political Constituency **********On the other hand, allowing deductions for dividend payments could cost the Treasury as much as $50 billion a year in lost revenue, a sum the Government cannot afford. Moreover, there is hardly a political constituency for such a move. Most corporate executives oppose dividend deductions, believing they would only increase pressure on them to pay higher dividends and not allow the untaxed profits to be used for new investment. **********As for increased regulation, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee's finance subcommittee, has been working most of the year on legislation to require more public disclosure about takeover deals and to guarantee that buyers have their financing in order before a tender offer is made. **********But when Washington's attention to takeovers began to flag, Mr. Markey turned his primary focus to other legislation dealing with regulation of the stock and commodity markets that he thought more likely to become law. No bill on buyouts has been introduced. **********And the Bush Administration has become increasingly hostile to Congressional action in this area. Earlier this year, Transportation Secretary Skinner said he wanted the authority to review takeovers in the airline industry to make certain the buyers' heavy debts would not affect the safety of air travel. Recently, however, the Secretary has opposed such legislation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/14/business/about-real-estate-co-op-converters-start-to-rent-in-slowdown.html": {"writer_name": "Andree Brooks", "pub_date": "1989-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "About Real Estate; Co-op Converters Start To Rent in Slowdown", "print_headline": "About Real Estate; Co-op Converters Start To Rent in Slowdown", "body_text": " **********A growing number of cooperative and condominium converters in New Jersey have begun to rent rather than sell their swelling inventory of vacant units, reflecting the continued slowdown in residential sales that has especially affected that state's conversion market. **********The shift presents an unusual opportunity for a buyer who might have difficulty accumulating the down payment needed to purchase. Many of these rental deals allow part or all of the first year's rent to be credited toward a down payment, if the renter agrees to buy during the period of the lease. **********The reason so many rentals are being offered, the converters concede, stems from cash flow problems resulting from the heavy costs of carrying vacant apartments over a long period. Rentals are also an appealing way to encourage people to ''try out the product,'' as Marc Solomon, president of the Solomon Organization of Clark, N.J., put it, in the hope they will eventually buy. **********Consider the deal being offered at Ken Gardens, a 280-unit garden apartment complex in Cliftwood, N.J., which was converted to condominium ownership in October 1987. With about 50 vacant units still on its hands, MLG Properties of New York City, the converter, is offering to rent one- or two-bedroom units for $525 to $625 a month, depending on size. **********The year's lease comes with an option to buy that locks in the current asking price for a year. The year's rent can be used to cover the down payment if the renter chooses to exercise the option. For example, a one-bedroom unit, renting for $525, would accumulate $6,300 - almost enough to cover the 10 percent down payment of $7,000 for the $70,000 unit. Some 35 people have rented units since the offer was made three months ago. **********The Solomon Organization has similar New Jersey deals at Riverview in Edison, the Mountain Club in Parsipanny, the Courts in East Brunswick and the Orchard in East Windsor, among others. **********The Solomon deals, however, are more restrictive. Even though renters get a one-year lease, they must decide in four to six months whether to buy at the original option price. After that, the option and the ability to credit the rent toward a down payment end. **********Mr. Solomon said he was also offering ''investor packages'' - from two to ten apartments, many of them already occupied by renters, at a 5 to 15 percent discount from their individual prices. Monthly rents range from $600 to $875, depending upon location and size. In the 12 months since he began phasing in the rental program, Mr. Solomon said, a third of the renters have decided to exercise their option. **********At Highland Station, an 80-unit condominum conversion in Orange, N.J., renters must sign a purchase contract and pay 5 percent of the down payment before they move in, said Asher Bernstein, the converter. The rent in subsequent months then builds to a point where the full 10 percent down payment is reached. Rents range from $550 for a studio to $1,016 for a two-bedroom apartment. Prices range from $59,900 for the studios to $133,000 for the best two-bedroom units. **********By contrast, Aaron Ziegelman, a New York converter, is permitting people to simply rent vacant units at his cooperative conversion at 32 South Munn Avenue in East Orange, N.J. The 10-story building has 133 units, 30 of which are vacant. ''Options only benefit the person with the option,'' he said. ''I prefer to take my chances.'' **********There are many reasons for the difficulties facing the New Jersey conversion market, brokers say. For instance, except for communities close to New York City the cooperative concept has not proved especially popular, even though the converters insist it helps buyers because the down payment is much lower than for a condominium. **********Alan Chokov, president of Chokov Realtors of Ocean Township, N.J., maintains that the glut has also been caused by overly optimistic sales projections made before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. **********The tax changes removed a large number of investors from the pool of potential buyers. In addition, he said, price increases deterred many tenants from buying. In contrast to New York City conversions, those in New Jersey do not offer deep discounts to current tenants, mainly because New Jersey tenants do not have the right to stay on indefinitely as renters. **********Further, the slow market is acting as its own deterrent, brokers say. Some buyers, they add, are waiting for prices to fall further from their 1987 highs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/22/world/new-refugee-commissioner-defends-predecessor-at-un.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Refugee Commissioner Defends Predecessor at U.N.", "print_headline": "New Refugee Commissioner Defends Predecessor at U.N.", "body_text": " **********The new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees used his first news conference today to defend the special travel and entertainment allowances that led to the resignation last month of his predecessor, Jean-Pierre Hocke. **********Theovald Stoltenberg, a Norwegian appointed by the General Assembly Monday, said the allowances Mr. Hocke received were justified by the low level of United Nations salaries and the fact that many governments subsidize their nationals in top United Nations jobs.

Discipline was further tightened two months ago, when two unfinished escape tunnels were found at another prison,, in Eskisehir, west of Ankara. **********Early this week, Justice Minister Oltan Sungurlu accepted most of the hunger strikers' demands, raising hopes for a settlement. But his refusal to yield on crucial points, continuing the stalemate. They include demands for more liberal visiting privileges and for permission to receive food packages from outside, which are now banned to make it harder to hold the kind of long hunger strike now underway. #72 Inmates Hospitalized Since the strike began, the health of many protesters has deteriorated. **********Two died last week as they and nearly 300 other fasting prisoners were transferred from Eskisehir to Aydin, 300 miles to the west.

Fifteen have accepted medical treatment, but no food, and the authorities reportedly are making no attempt to force-feed anyone. **********Nearly all the demonstrators are said to be left-wing political advocates or members of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, a separatist group responsible for repeated terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets in the largely Kurdish southeastern sector of the country.

Protesters' Numbers Are Down **********By day, about 20,000 student demonstrators continue to occupy Tiananmen Square, in the heart of Beijing, but the numbers are diminishing and many of the students are from other parts of the country. Somewhat fewer spend the night at the square. **********The declining numbers seem to reflect mostly weariness after almost six weeks of nearly continuous protest, and disgust at the increasing filth on the square, rather than intimidation by the Government polemics. **********But fear was in the air in Beijing today, as many intellectuals and party officials worried that a wave of arrests or a brutal military crackdown were imminent. The alarm was compounded by a wave of rumors, circulated among ordinary people as well as among diplomats and party officials and carried by foreign news agencies, that suggested that Mr. Zhao and as many as hundreds of others had been arrested, and that rival military units were about to start shooting at each other. Rumors Full of Holes **********The atmosphere is such that many of these reports were immediately believed. In fact, the reports are mostly impossible to prove, and some were clearly false. **********''They haven't been arrested,'' a somewhat surprised Fang Ke, the son of the dissidents Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, said today of his parents. There had been persistent reports that Mr. Fang and Miss Li had been seized for counterrevolutionary activities. **********Other prominent intellectuals or officials - including Ren Wanding, a leader of the Democracy Wall movement of a decade ago; Yan Jiaqi, a political scientist, and Yan Mingfu, a party official - were also known not to have been arrested, despite rumors to the contrary. **********There were contradictory reports about whether Mr. Zhao, his aide Bao Tong and others had been arrested, but a senior official who works in the Communist Party headquarters said they had not been. A Call for More Marxism **********Though the purge rumors seemed overblown, there were other indications of Mr. Li's ascendancy. A commission of retired party leaders declared on national television tonight that the real problem was lack of attention to Marxism. **********''The comrades present at the meeting point out that the unrest is not at all a fluke,'' the television announcer said, referring to the Central Advisory Commission's meeting today. ''One of the major causes is that for a long time we have failed to pay enough attention to Marxist ideological education.'' **********The meeting, led by a retired Politburo member, Chen Yun, also appeared to criticize Mr. Zhao, saying: ''At such a critical time, we old comrades must stand up and, along with the whole party, firmly expose the conspiracy of the very, very small number of people who want to create chaos, and firmly and unequivocally fight against them without making any concessions.'' **********The suggestion for more ideological education could be read as the first call for a new campaign for ideological purity, like the campaigns against ''bourgeois liberalization'' in 1987 and ''spiritual pollution'' in 1983 and 1984. Those meant a clampdown on intellectual freedom and minor purges of officials who did not toe the official line. Zhao's Official Status Still Murky **********It has been 10 days since Mr. Zhao, at a Politburo Standing Committee meeting, challenged Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, and was subsequently stripped of his powers, party officials say. **********There are contradictory reports about whether Mr. Zhao has formally been suspended from his post, and so far there have been no official indications of where he stands. **********National newspapers and news broadcasts have not acknowledged his existence since Saturday, although the Foreign Ministry indicated Thursday that he was still General Secretary of the Communist Party. **********There remain a plethora of confusing and conflicting reports about Mr. Deng's intentions, but party officials and diplomats suggest that Mr. Deng and Prime Minister Li are now trying to build a solid case against Mr. Zhao to present to the Central Committee. The situation has been complicated because Mr. Zhao refuses to resign, as his predecessor Hu Yaobang agreed to do under pressure two years ago. **********Because Mr. Zhao refuses to step down, Mr. Li is trying to mount as harsh a campaign as possible against the party leader, both to justify the extreme step of dismissal and to intimidate those Central Committee officials who might be tempted to support him, these accounts say. At Least 5 Specific Charges **********The charges they have drawn against Mr. Zhao are said to include these: he led an ''anti-party clique''; he incited the student demonstrations and the resulting turmoil for his own political ends; he is the No. 1 corrupt official in the nation; he fostered splits in the military, and he released national secrets by disclosing that the Central Committee had voted to consult Mr. Deng on important matters. **********A speech by President Yang Shangkun attacking Mr. Zhao was circulated among ministers and other top officials on Thursday, and among department heads today, say officials familiar with the speech. **********The speech also criticizes Hu Qili, a member of the Politburo standing committee who supported Mr. Zhao in proposing conciliation with the student demonstrators, as well as a few others like Mr. Zhao's aide Bao Tong. **********The distribution of the materials criticizing Mr. Zhao was delayed because an enlarged meeting of the Politburo, scheduled to be completed Wednesday, could not be ended on time after some officials refused to go along with the criticism of Mr. Zhao, a party official said. He said that despite the opposition, the original charges against Mr. Zhao were retained. Rank and File Reaction Unclear **********It is not clear how the broader party membership will react to the charges against Mr. Zhao. The corruption charge against him is regarded as a shrewd move, because corruption has been one of the student demonstrators' foremost concerns. On the other hand, many party members seem upset with the return to power struggles and to the harsh language of the Cultural Revolution. **********Earlier this week a speech by Li Ximing, the Beijing party chief, was distributed to middle-level party officials so that they could study it and then pass it down to local units. But knowledgable Chinese say that some of the officials rebelled at being told they should pass on the speech, which criticized student demonstrations and implicitly criticized Mr. Zhao, although not by name. **********As a result, distribution of Mr. Li's speech has been held up in some ''work units,'' and in others it has been read to large groups rather than studied in individual cells. **********Mr. Zhao has some friends on the Central Committee, and some Chinese say there remains a faint chance that the Central Committee would refuse to go along with ousting him. But most say that by the time party members have reached the Central Committee level, they are so used to democratic centralism that they will follow the instructions of the leadership. **********A young party member with a relative who is a friend and protege of Mr. Zhao was asked what the relative would do if asked to endorse criticisms of Mr. Zhao in such a meeting. ''He would go along with it, but in his heart he would protest,'' the party member said. Capital Appears Calmer **********In some ways life in the capital is returning to normal. Most buses are running again, and traffic is no longer as congested as it was. Army troops are still surrounding the capital, but citizens no longer turn out every night to put up roadblocks to keep the troops from advancing on the city center. **********There have been widespread reports of military units with competing loyalties confronting each other. But the reports cannot be confirmed, and the source of the tension may have been resolved with an agreement by the commanders of the Beijing Military Region to support Prime Minister Li and his order for martial law. **********People's Daily today carried a letter from the Beijing Military Region Party Committee expressing support for martial law, and a party official said the tensions appeared to have been reduced. He said one reason why so many troops have been brought to the capital was that they had to deal not only with the student demonstrators but also with the risk of confrontation with Beijing Military Region troops, many of whom are considered loyal to Mr. Zhao. Defense Minister Under a Cloud **********In another sign of military support for the Government, all of the nation's major military commanders attended the expanded meeting of the Politburo this week in the capital, a Western diplomat said. He said the only possible exception was Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, who is said to be facing political difficulties because of his ties to Mr. Zhao and because of suspicions that he contributed to the hesitance of the Beijing Military Region to respond to the call for a military crackdown. **********The diplomat said that there appeared to have been a deal worked out with Mr. Li and Mr. Deng, such that the military would support them and obey orders, and in return the army would not be ordered to engage in violent confrontations with students or ordinary citizens. **********There are vastly different estimates for the number of troops called to Beijing in recent weeks, with some Chinese saying the numbers go as high as 900,000 and involve depletion of forces along the Chinese-Soviet border. Most diplomatic estimates are far lower, ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 troops summoned to the area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/07/business/a-big-schedule-of-auctions-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Big Schedule of Auctions This Week", "print_headline": "A Big Schedule of Auctions This Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of new issues this week includes today's weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, with an auction of 247-day cash management bills on Thursday. **********This week, the Government also plans to do its quarterly refinancing, beginning with an auction of new three-year notes tomorrow, followed by an auction of new 10-year notes on Wednesday and an auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday.

Manokai Mangal wears no ribbons on his crisp battle fatigues, but his stature needs no underlining among supporters of the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul. **********General Mangal, 40 years old, has been named a Hero of the Revolution for the successful defense of Jalalabad during the more than six months it has been under attack by Muslim rebels. In an army that has known few winners, he has gained at least a temporary victory, and with it what he and his superiors in the capital represent as a turning point in the war. **********The general chain-smoked American cigarettes as he talked about the Jalalabad battle, which had been dwindling. When a group of foreign reporters flew into the city's newly reopened airport recently for a 24-hour tour, the equipment that seemed to be getting the biggest workout at front-line positions were the Soviet Army bed frames on which troops were sprawled at the height of the day. A Mood of Confidence **********''We have won this battle, and we will go on winning,'' the general said. ''Of that there can be no doubt.'' **********As General Mangal spoke, the approach of dusk was accompanied by the roar of a Soviet-made multiple-rocket launcher stationed near the shrapnel-pitted winter palace of the exiled King, Mohammad Zahir Shah. It is a forlorn building sitting amid untended gardens a short walk from the general's office. The rocket bursts, aimed at the front lines at Samarkhel eight miles to the southeast, were the most threatening sounds of the day. **********At the airport, three miles from the city along the Samarkhel road, nerves were more on edge. When the Jalalabad attack began in March, rebels reached the airport perimeter within hours before being driven back. For five months the airport was closed. When it was reopened in July, it was only for night sorties from Kabul, flown by twin-engine Antonov-32 turboprops. The planes fly with all lights extinguished and at a 45-degree angle of descent toward a runway that is lighted only in the final stages of approach. On the 35-minute flight from Kabul, the aircraft was crowded with civilians, including women with babies returning after months of refuge in the capital. Children in a Besieged City **********One of the children, a 7-year-old girl, was the daughter of Amid Arab, attorney general of Nangarhar Province, of which Jalalabad is the capital. Mr. Arab laughed at suggestions that taking a child back into a besieged city was risky. ''We are not crazy,'' he said. **********That others might think otherwise was evident outside the darkened air terminal when soldiers used rifle butts to keep crowds of would-be passengers for the return flight from storming the aircraft's rear loading ramp. **********Elsewhere, the tour provided evidence of returning normality. During a visit nearly four months ago, shops were boarded up; hospitals, schools, offices and mosques were closed, and streets were deserted except for military traffic. Residents stopped to plead for American intervention to halt the rebel rocketing that had blasted homes in every part of the center. About 500 civilians were said to have died, with thousands more wounded. **********Now streets are busy again with pedestrians, bicyclists and motorized rickshaws, despite gasoline that sells at $12 a gallon. Storefront traders have opened their shutters and are well stocked with imported cigarettes, cans of Dutch soda and rolls of Chinese toilet paper. Bread, vegetables and meat appear to be in adequate supply, at prices roughly twice what they are in Kabul, 85 miles to the west along a road that is said to be open for regular convoys. In the evening, kebab houses do a brisk business, their charcoal braziers glowing on the unlighted streets. Casualties of Fighting **********Schools, closed since the battle began in March, have reopened. At the all-male Nangarhar Provincial Secondary School, classroom roofs have been shattered by rockets. **********A forest of hands were raised when students were asked whether they had lost relatives in the fighting. Afizullah, the 46-year-old principal, said 36 of the 2,100 students had been killed, some of them on military duty. **********Mr. Afizullah, who like many Afghans uses only one name, said his 11-year-old daughter had been killed by a rocket. He asked that a message be relayed to Americans. ''Tell them we are tired of war,'' he said. Few Undamaged Buildings **********Elsewhere, construction teams have begun to tackle damage in this city of 170,000 people, where fighting has left few buildings untouched. **********Strains within the Government military command over proposals to move beyond Samarkhel, regained from the rebels in early July, have been resolved in favor of caution. The rebels have few heavily defended positions between Samarkhel and Torkham, on the Pakistani border 50 miles to the east. But the prevailing view in Kabul is that holding Jalalabad and pushing the rebels back to 8 to 20 miles from the city have been enough so far to underscore the Government's demand that the war be halted by negotiation. **********''What we have accomplished here should surely convince people that the problems of Afghanistan cannot be solved by fighting,'' General Mangal said. Referring to the role played by the United States and Pakistan in arming and training the rebels, and in encouraging them to mount the Jalalabad attack, he added, ''If our opponents in the United States and Pakistan wish to persist in war, let them learn the lessons of Jalalabad.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/20/business/finance-new-issues-914789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 222, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "body_text": " **********The World Bank yesterday announced the pricing and terms of a $1.5 billion global bond issue.

The overture came three weeks after loyal troops crushed an attempted coup by senior military officers who were seeking an end to the war. It also followed some recent military successes by the rebels. **********This month, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, which has been fighting for more than a decade, announced its acceptance of the peace initiative, characterized by Western diplomats as the greatest concession that Colonel Mengistu had ever made to insurgents. **********However, the Government said later that independence for Eritrea was out of the question. The Eritreans responded that this in effect annulled Colonel Mengistu's initial offer of talks. **********Today, though, Mr. Isaias said that the warring sides had to ''go immediately to negotiations.'' He called on other countries to help insure that any talks held were without conditions so as not to squander an opportunity for lasting peace in the province. **********He said that in the past the Eritrean rebels had proposed three options in their proposals for peace and self-determination, including independence, a referendum on the future of the province and regional autonomy. **********''We don't want to talk about independence now,'' Mr. Isaias said.

One CBS News executive said revenue from commercials on ''48 Hours'' averages between $1 million and $1.3 million, meaning CBS takes in up to $900,000 in profit on the show each week. **********The show, entering its second full season, covers one topic, reporting what takes place over the course of two days. Dan Rather, the anchor, does an occasional report as well. **********The program is also improving its ratings. After averaging an 8.9 rating in 1988, ''48 Hours'' climbed to 9.8 this past season, meaning that 9.8 percent of the nation's homes with television sets were tuned in. (Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.) ''What we are finding now is that we can not only do the shows cheaper, we can also get entertainment-size numbers from them,'' said Andrew Heyward, the show's executive producer. **********The show, which begins its new season with a three-hour special called ''Return to Crack Street,'' is a frequently cited example of the cost efficiency of news programming, one reason for the trend toward more news in prime time. **********David Poltrack, CBS's senior vice president of research, said several factors had fueled the increase in news programs: *********** News programs cost less to make. *********** News programs have unmatched longevity as successful prime-time programs. *********** The networks own all rights to news programs. *********** The audience for news programs is likely to increase. Cheaper to Produce **********News programming, with many fixed costs, is almost always cheaper to produce than entertainment programming. Among the news programs in prime time, ''48 Hours'' is now the least expensive, a CBS News executive said. The show uses a small regular staff, relying on the rest of the CBS News organization, and it has only 17 full-time producers. Each of the other network news programs has more than 20. **********The program also has only one full-time correspondent, Bernard Goldberg. ''It's an event-driven show, unlike 'Prime Time Live,' which is personality-driven,'' a CBS executive said. ''Personalities always wind up costing you money.'' **********''Prime Time Live,'' ABC's newest news entry, with Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, features live interviews and on-location reports of breaking news. The costs of supporting a large staff, paying for satellite time and the sizable salaries for its on-air personalities are the difference between the costs for ''Prime Time Live'' and ''48 Hours,'' a CBS News executive said. **********But both programs are expected to be excellent investments for their networks, Mr. Poltrack said, because successful news programs have an almost unlimited life span. CBS's ''60 Minutes'' is the longest-running program on television, and ABC's ''20/ 20'' is the third-longest running. Neither program shows any sign of losing momentum. Both increased their ratings last season. Battle With Hollywood **********In addition, the networks, now locked in a battle with Hollywood studios over costs of programming, want to produce more of their own shows. Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said the network was still reeling from the cost increases negotiated this spring by several hit series, notably ''Murder She Wrote,'' produced by Universal Studios. ''We have to control more of our destiny,'' he said. Mr. Stringer said CBS had already sold ''48 Hours'' in Britain and would continue to market it abroad, as it does with ''60 Minutes.'' **********According to CBS research, news is now the second most popular programming form on television, trailing only situation comedies. Comedies averaged a 16.4 rating last year, with news programs next with 13.8. That beat serial dramas, at 13.4, action shows, at 12.2, and general dramas, at 12. **********Much of the news edge was built by ''60 Minutes'' with its 21.7 rating last year. But no news program finished last in its time period. All four this past season, which also include CBS's ''West 57th'' (being renamed ''Saturday Night With Connie Chung''), finished first or second, and ''Prime Time Live'' has so far maintained that mark, averaging a second-place finish its first six times on the air. 'Long-Term Potential' **********''The long-term potential is even better,'' Mr. Poltrack said. The reason: the aging of the baby-boom generation, now reaching its 40's. Mr. Poltrack said the ratings for the network evening newscasts were 43 percent higher among people over 40, and the ratings for prime-time news programs were 18 percent higher among people over 40. **********''More of the children of baby boomers are becoming teen-agers,'' Mr. Poltrack said. ''When that happens, the pattern of family viewing breaks up and parents recapture the television set. The tendency is to draw away from family comedies and toward news programs. That adds up to a very good prognosis for the future of news in prime time.'' **********The prognosis is especially good for ''48 Hours,'' Mr. Poltrack said, because the show is already established as an excellent alternative to ''The Cosby Show'' on Thursdays at 8, where it attracts many adults not watching NBC's superhit. 'Cosby' Losing Viewers **********'' 'Cosby' has peaked and is gradually losing audience,'' Mr. Poltrack said. ''Once it leaves the air, that will only help the entrenched No. 2 show in the time period.'' **********Mr. Heyward, remembering that a year ago at this time ''48 Hours'' was given little chance of even surviving against ''Cosby,'' is not preparing to assume dominance in the time period. ''I would be foolish to predict we will break away and become a hit,'' he said. ''But I am encouraged by the steady growth. And until it stops growing, I will continue to be encouraged.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/world/6-blacks-end-sit-in-at-embassy-in-pretoria.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 Blacks End Sit-In at Embassy in Pretoria", "print_headline": "6 Blacks End Sit-In at Embassy in Pretoria", "body_text": " **********Six South African black anti-apartheid protesters ended their sit-in at the British Embassy today after just over 24 hours, complaining bitterly that diplomats had urged them to leave. **********The five men and a woman had entered the embassy Wednesday to protest restrictions placed by Pretoria on former detainees like themselves. **********''It is deplorable and regrettable that the British embassy did not give us proper sanctuary,'' one of the six told reporters outside the mission. **********The six said in a statement that they had been denied food, water and blankets.

Habeck, the director of advertising for K Mart, said the company's goals were to increase traffic in the stores and also to enhance K Mart's image by being associated with the network's season premiere. **********CBS will use its television and radio networks to promote the campaign and will buy space in national magazines and newspapers. But the crucial element, Mr. Schweitzer said, would be special K Mart advertising inserts in Sunday newspapers that will reach 72 million households in each week of the three-week contest. **********A game card will be attached to the K Mart insert section, inviting readers to match a winning number flashed during one of the new CBS programs. **********K Mart will display posters and signs promoting new CBS programs in its 2,200 stores across the country, with special midway banners in the center aisles of every store. Every TV set for sale in the store will be tuned to the CBS station, and special videos featuring previews of the new CBS shows will run regularly on those sets. **********Most of the six million prizes will be coffee mugs carrying the CBS logotype. Twelve grand prizes, either Dodge mini-vans or family vacations to Hollywood, will be awarded at the end of the campaign. Another 6,000 prizes will be television sets and VCR's. **********In explaining CBS's decision to attempt the joint campaign with K Mart, Mr. Schweitzer pointed to the failure by the networks to generate any public interest last fall in the new season because of production delays due to the Hollywood writers' strike. **********''We need to create that old feeling of excitement about premiere week,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. ''We are no longer trading viewers with two other outlets. We're facing a growing number of competitors. We've got to get attention.'' **********He also emphasized that even before being approached by K Mart, CBS had been seeking new promotional outlets to reach audiences, especially viewers under 35, who are not watching CBS programs. The average age of the CBS viewer is over 50, but NBC and ABC have both succeeded in attracting younger audiences. **********''At CBS we have to appear in places we haven't appeared before,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. He added that when CBS tested the promotional campaign in four cities this spring, it found that ''the game skewed younger, to a 35-and-younger group. That's exactly the audience we have to reach.'' **********He said the chief purpose of the campaign was to get viewers to sample CBS's new television series in September. Last season, CBS introduced many series that a significant number of viewers did not watch even once. **********Neither side discussed the specific costs of the deal. They are difficult to estimate because no money will change hands. Instead, they are exchanging promotional considerations, with CBS giving extensive on-air mentions to K Mart and K Mart giving CBS access to its store space and its Sunday newspaper inserts. **********Mr. Schweitzer said the deal would still be very expensive, with production costs considerably more than what CBS had originally budgeted for its fall promotion campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/19/business/key-rates-955789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/16/business/campeau-said-to-lose-control-of-retail-giant.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1989-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Campeau Said To Lose Control Of Retail Giant", "print_headline": "Campeau Said To Lose Control Of Retail Giant", "body_text": " **********Robert Campeau, the Canadian developer who amassed one of the world's biggest retail empires by borrowing heavily to buy such stores as Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, was forced yesterday to yield control to get yet another loan to keep the operation solvent, executives in Toronto and New York said. **********The financial problems of the company, which in large part are the result of the huge debt created by his retail acquisitions over the last three years, strongly suggest that many of the stores he owns will change hands in the months ahead. Such changes could lead to considerably more price-cutting and less appeal to affluent shoppers at some of his most fashionable stores. **********Already Mr. Campeau has put Bloomingdale's, one of the nation's most innovative retail showplaces, on the auction block to raise cash. **********Over the last week, the situation worsened for the retailer when many suppliers postponed shipments of clothes and home furnishings as a number of the Campeau stores experienced a cash squeeze. **********The problems come at a particularly inopportune time for Abraham & Straus, which just opened a new store in Herald Square as the keystone of the most ambitious shopping mall every built in Manhattan. A.&S. executives, however, said the new A.&S. Plaza store would probably not be affected. **********As part of the loan agreement announced yesterday, which is intended to help with that cash squeeze, Mr. Campeau will keep the title of chairman of the financially troubled Campeau Corporation, the executives said, but he will share responsibility with at least four representatives of lenders and investors. **********The shift in command of the company was arranged in an all-day Campeau board meeting in Toronto. At the meeting, directors and lenders agreed in principle, with certain conditions, to a $250 million loan from Olympia & York Development to provide working capital for the American stores. **********Olympia & York, another Canadian developer, already has 24 percent of Campeau stock and will receive an unspecified number of added shares because of the loan. **********Campeau acquired Bloomingdale's, A.&S. and other stores last year when it bought Federated Department Stores for $6.6 billion. Two years before it had added Jordan Marsh in Miami and Boston and Stern's in New Jersey, among others, when it purchased Allied Stores for $3.5 billion. Market Roiled for Several Days **********The corporation had to borrow heavily, using ''junk bonds,'' to finance both acquisitions. Concerns about the troubles at Campeau have roiled the junk bond market for the last several days. **********The shipments of clothes and home furnishings that were postponed by many suppliers came after warnings by factoring and credit companies that they could no longer guarantee credit for those shipments to the Federated/Allied stores. **********Typically, producers sell their accounts receivables to factoring companies, or receive credit from them on the basis of those sales. But both suppliers and factoring executives had said that they probably would resume shipments and credit after Campeau's board confirmed the loan. That confirmation came at about 5 P.M. Constraints on Authority **********As part of the conditions for the loan, financial sources said the Campeau directors put constraints on Mr. Campeau's operating authority by setting up a special committee that would consist of representatives of banks, Olympia & York and Edward J. DeBartolo, a leading American developer who owns 7.5 percent of Campeau common shares. **********Although his wings were clipped in the deal, the 66-year-old Mr. Campeau was able to retain some authority, even if it is as a participant rather than as sole authority, despite reported pressure from his main lenders yesterday to give up his chairman's job. **********Campeau's board in its announcement touched on the management changes in a cryptic manner. Two committees will be set up. Executives in Toronto who are close to Campeau said provisions in the Olympia & York loan call for a special committee of directors to oversee the day-to-day operations of Campeau. This presumably will be the committee of at least five members that will include Mr. Campeau. **********A senior executive management committee will also be set up, said a Campeau spokeswoman in the corporation's United States headquarters in Cincinnati. Asked for names of the members of both committees, she said those would not be disclosed until a definitive agreement is reached on the Olympia & York loan. **********The statement from the company said that a senior executive management group will take charge of certain activities, ''reporting directly to a committee of Campeau's board including representatives of minority shareholders.'' **********The activities referred to were new financing for both Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores subsidiaries and the intended sale of Bloomingdale's, which was announced last week. There was no elaboration and no indication of the precise nature of the Campeau board committee. Banker Agreements Needed **********Noting that the terms of its $250 million convertible, secured loan from Olympia & York were agreed to in principle, Campeau said the loan was conditional on agreement from bankers. ''It is conditional upon the bankers to Campeau and its units, Allied Stores Corporation and Federated Department Stores, agreeing to certain conditions, including the extension of one loan to April 1990 and other matters related to funding under present commitments,'' the Campeau statement said. **********''The loan is to address liquidity needs at Allied and Federated while Allied and Federated pursue a major refinancing and restructuring, including the intended sale of Federated's New York-based Bloomingdale's department store,'' Campeau said. It added that discussions were continuing with its bankers. **********Efforts to reach Mr. Campeau and Ronald Tysoe, president of the company, were unsuccessful. **********Before the Campeau announcement, Jerome Kenyon, president of Congress Talcott Factors, a large factoring concern in New York, said, ''We have cut out credit to our clients which sell to the Federated/Allied stores as have most all other factors. But even if Campeau issues its statement on approval of the loan, we will think very carefully about our commitments and will probably cut our credit lines to their stores.'' **********Because of the lateness of the Campeau announcement, the Toronto Stock Exchange did not resume trading in Campeau stock, which has been halted since Wednesday on pending news about the financial problems of the stores. **********With the $250 million loan contributing $150 million to the Federated stores and $100 million to the Allied units, suppliers said the funds would allow some postponed shipments to resume but they questioned how long the money would last. One Month's Needs **********The consensus was that the money would cover about one month's needs for merchandise in the combined Federated/Allied stores, leaving open the matter of Christmas inventory-building. Most large stores carry an on-hand inventory for about three weeks. Current Christmas season stocks are running about 25 percent of needs, according to various estimates. **********Both Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus said that some merchandise shipments had been halted to their stores, but the stoppage would have no serious effect if it lasted only a day or two. ''That started only in the last 24 hours,'' said Chaim Edelstein, chairman and chief executive of Abraham & Straus, before the loan announcement. ''If it continues, it will definitely hurt. But we think it will be alleviated when Campeau's announcement is made.'' Temporary Halts Cited **********At Bloomingdale's, Julian Taub, vice president for planning, said, ''A few companies that use factors informed us that they will temporarily hold up shipments. If it's only a day or so, it will be only a small problem.'' **********Yet skepticism remained over the loan's long-term value. **********''The $250 million won't be enough for all those stores to go very long,'' observed Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Barnard Retail Marketing Newsletter. ''Suppliers say it will only pay their bills through October. So it seems likely that Campeau must take other steps to raise money.'' **********The most likely steps, most analysts agree, is that Campeau will seek to sell other store divisions, which may include any of the Federated or Allied stores."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/21/business/briefs-865789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Arianespace, the European satellite-launching concern, signed a contract with the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization covering three launchings and four launching options for Intelsat's new family of satellites, Intelsat 7. *********** Canadian Pacific Ltd., Toronto, said it would sell 40 percent of its subsidiary CNCP Telecommunications to Rogers Communications Inc., Toronto, owned by Rogers Telecommunications Ltd., for $250 million to $275 million. *********** Coleman Co., Wichita, Kan., said its chairman, Sheldon C.

Then comes the tagline: ''Bottled beer taste in a can: Wouldn't that be great?'' **********For Coors, Keystone and Keystone Light represent the company's first foray into the budget segment of the beer market known as popular-priced beers. In that segment, six-packs often cost about 50 cents less than premium beers, like Coors, the brand that over the decade has transformed Adolph Coors from a small, regional brewery located in Golden, Colo., into the nation's fourth-largest brewery. **********But Keystone's commercials do not mention its low price, the result of some marketing studies. Robert Klugman, Coors vice president for development, said the company examined some advertisements for the Miller Brewing Company's Meister Brau, which promoted that beer as tasting just as good as Budweiser but costing less. **********''We looked at those ads and we found out that people really don't want a cheap beer that tastes good,'' he said. ''They want a good-tasting beer, and if it's less expensive, that's terrific.'' **********Coors's market studies also found a problem with its plan to sell Keystone only in cans. While cans cost less and are more convenient for customers than bottles, many beer drinkers believe bottled beer tastes better. So the campaign stresses that the Keystone can is specially lined and offers ''bottled beer taste.'' Never mind that the lining is an industry standard used in most beer cans. **********In fact, Keystone's taste is different from Coors, but similar to other beers in the popular-priced segment, the company says. **********Despite focusing the commercials on such an important attribute as bottled-beer taste, Keystone's ad agency took a comical approach in the ads, said Bob Simon, Foote, Cone & Belding's senior vice president and group creative director. **********''The last thing we wanted to be was serious about it,'' Mr. Simon said. ''A lot of beer advertising suffers from being much too serious.'' **********Besides the fantasy about baseball, other new Keystone ads ask: ''Wouldn't it be great'' if beer-drinking viewers were in charge of the ''annual swimsuit issue,'' and, ''Wouldn't it be great if lawyers showed up to tell you someone you didn't even know left you eight gajillion dollars?'' **********By entering the popular-priced segment, Coors is challenging the leaders in that market: Busch, Old Milwaukee and Milwaukee's Best. The segment is also the domain of older, unglamorous brews like Schlitz, Hamm's and Pabst Blue Ribbon. **********But Coors also has its sights on two archrivals, Stroh's and Heileman. Keystone, which was introduced nationwide on Sept. 11, is aimed squarely at Stroh's Old Milwaukee and Heileman's Ranier, both popular-priced brands. Analysts say both Stroh and Heileman are vulnerable to attack because the companies are weakened by heavy debt and a shrinking share of the relatively flat $40 billion retail beer market. **********According to Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication, Anheuser-Busch, with 41 percent of the market, and Miller, with 21.2 percent, are growing. But Stroh, in third place with 10.7 percent, and Heileman, in fifth place with 7.9 percent, are sinking fast. **********So Coors, in fourth place with 8.6 percent, sees an opportunity to steal market share from both. It eventually hopes to capture 15 to 18 percent of the market, said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles beverage industry consultant. **********Industry analysts say the popular-priced segment offers the most opportunity for Coors to grow because its flagship brand is losing volume to stronger competitors like Budweiser and to light beers. **********Popular-priced beers account for more than 25 percent of all beer sales, and Stroh and Heileman are ''over-represented'' in that segment, said Benj Steinman, associate publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication. **********''There is an opportunity to pick up volume in the sub-premium category, or it will go to Anheuser-Busch and Miller,'' said Mr. Klugman of Coors. ''Anheuser-Busch and Miller both have several sub-premium entries. We need to be competitive in this area.'' **********It could be a difficult effort. ''It's a tough environment, said Michael Bellas, president of the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a consulting and research company. ''You already have the national brewers with their own popular-priced brands. Everyone's targeting the same group.'' **********To market Keystone, Coors executives have told wholesalers that it will spend more than Stroh spends on Old Milwaukee.

Whitmore, the company's president, will succeed Colby H. Chandler as chief executive next year and that his chief rival for Mr. Chandler's job, J. Phillip Samper, will retire as vice chairman by the end of the year at the age of 55. **********The change of chief executive, which will officially take place when Mr. Chandler retires June 1, comes at a time when Kodak management is under pressure from financial analysts to trim operations to improve profit margins. **********''It was not a surprise that Kay Whitmore is succeeding Colby Chandler because he had been ahead all along,'' said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ''The surprise is Phil Samper taking early retirement at 55. All of a sudden a triumverate is shrinking down to one man who has a big company to run.''  Close to the Core **********''Phil Samper's decision came as somewhat of a surprise, although it was clear that it was an option he was considering,'' Mr. Whitmore said yesterday from the company's headquarters in Rochester. ''His departure does leave a hole in the ranks.'' **********In choosing Mr. Whitmore over Mr. Samper, the Kodak board picked an executive with a technical background and extensive experience in manufacturing over one largely identified with marketing. Mr. Whitmore said he would make sure Kodak stayed closer to its core businesses in film and photographic chemicals, where analysts have said most of Kodak's earnings problems are concentrated. **********Mr. Whitmore, who is 57 years old, said he would rely more heavily on the six group vice presidents who report to the chief executive. ''We believe that group of managers is ready to take on some of the responsibility of the chief executive's office.'' **********Although Mr. Samper issued a statement saying there was no philosphical dispute between him and Mr. Whitmore, analysts attributed his retirement to disappointment at losing the race for the top spot and the prospect of diminished authority. **********''Phil Samper, Colby Chandler and Kay Whitmore have been running that company almost as equals for the past few years,'' said Eugene G. Glazer, who is with Dean Whitter Reynolds. ''When Colby retires and Kay moves up, the position of Phil Samper would be reduced from what it was.''  'A Credibility Problem' **********Mr. Whitmore acknowledged that Kodak's top management, which is in the midst of its fourth cost-cutting drive in six years in an effort to bolster sagging profits, does not inspire a lot of confidence on Wall Street. ''Obviously there is a credibility problem in the financial community,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, he said the current round of cuts would exceed the promised 4,500 jobs. ''I believe we are making the difficult decision that will get us back to where we should be,'' he said. He said more than 5,000 employees would leave the payroll, which stood at more than 145,000 when the program started. **********The stock market reacted cautiously to yesterday's news, with Kodak closing at $42.75 a share, up 25 cents over the previous day. In the first three quarters of this year, Kodak's earnings declined 46 percent, to $1.82 a share, even though sales increased 8 percent, to $13.5 billion. **********Mr. Whitmore said the company, which is best known for its photographic film in yellow boxes, had gone too far afield in developing new lines of business and in acquisitions. ''We defined our focus too broadly,'' he said. ''Now we are focusing on the sectors we want to be in. We are defining what we mean when we say imaging, chemicals and health.'' (Various Kodak subsidiaries manufacture medical testing equipment and medical and dental film, and do research in immunology and biotechnology. Sterling Drug Inc., based in New York, is a subsidiary.)  Fellowship at M.I.T. **********Mr. Whitmore said the company would try to make better use of its technological capabilities to develop new products. ''We recently announced that we have film that is compatible with high definition television,'' he said. ''That excited the motion picture people because they are accustomed to using film as the capture medium for their productions.'' **********Mr. Whitmore joined Kodak in 1957, shortly after graduating from the University of Utah with a degree in chemistry. He was assigned to film manufacturing and stayed with it in various positions until winning a Sloan fellowship for study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974. **********After returning he became first assistant general manager of the United States and Canadian photographic division and then general manager. He became a vice president of the company in 1978 and was named president in 1983.  Polaroid Case Pending **********Analysts have said most of Kodak's earnings problems are concentrated in the company's core photographic business, the one Mr. Whitmore knows best. ''Kodak's photo business has been suffering a long-term margin erosion attributable to more competition'' and a changing mix of products, Ty Govatos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, wrote in a recent report. **********Also facing the company is a big judgment, which could run into billions of dollars, stemming from the loss of a patent infringement case involving instant photography to the Polaroid Corporation. Some analysts feel a large enough judgment -Polaroid has asked for $12 billion, which exceeds Kodak's net worth -could force the company to alter its strategy and sell more assets than it would like. **********Mr. Whitmore said the size of the judgment remained uncertain but added that he was ''confident we have the financial resources to cover the after-tax consequences.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/world/500-on-2-trains-reported-killed-by-soviet-gas-pipeline-explosion.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1989-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "500 on 2 Trains Reported Killed By Soviet Gas Pipeline Explosion", "print_headline": "500 on 2 Trains Reported Killed By Soviet Gas Pipeline Explosion", "body_text": " **********A powerful gas pipeline explosion demolished part of the trans-Siberian railway late Saturday night, engulfing two passenger trains in flames and leaving hundreds dead, according to the Tass press agency and local officials reached by telephone. **********President Mikhail S.

Graphic Scenes on Television **********Soviet television tonight showed unusually graphic scenes of the aftermath - dozens of acres of forest charred to the ground, passenger cars crushed and blackened by the blast, children with severe burns being rushed from helicopters to hospitals in Chelyabinsk. **********A television reporter said the explosion blew out windows in Asha, about eight miles away. **********Monday was proclaimed a national day of mourning, with flags to be lowered and entertainment programs canceled. **********The authorities canceled the planned resumption Monday of the national Congress of People's Deputies that has been laying the groundwork for a new Soviet government. **********The two trains were traveling between the Siberian city of Novosibirsk and the southern Russian city of Adler, near the resort town of Sochi on the Black Sea coast. **********At this time of year, those trains would normally be filled with families going to and from their holidays and with children bound for the large Pioneers holiday camp at Artek, on the Crimea. #109 Survivors Are Children Boris A. Sochilov, a civil defense official, said 109 of the 469 hospitalized survivors were children. **********The accident paralyzed traffic on an important leg of the trans-Siberian railroad and presumably will mean a major disruption in energy supplies until the gas supplies can be rerouted. **********The explosion was the worst known railroad disaster in Soviet history, and the latest in a series of catastrophes that have battered the country as Mr. Gorbachev tries to repair its ailing economy. **********First the Chernobyl nuclear accident in April 1986 dealt a severe setback to the Soviet atomic energy program. **********In September 1986, a Soviet cruise ship, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with a cargo ship in the Black Sea and 398 were killed. **********Then last December a devastating earthquake shook northern Armenia, claiming 25,000 lives and requiring the complete rebuilding of several cities and villages. **********Ethnic clashes in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and now Uzbekistan have also contributed to a sense that the country is deteriorating faster than Mr. Gorbachev can fix it. **********Tass said Mr. Gorbachev had left for the scene this morning along with Prime Minister Nikolai I.

Gorbachev of the Soviet Union that he wants a ''calm and peaceful'' period in Eastern Europe and made clear that the United States will not behave provocatively in the region, Administration officials said today. **********In less than 24 hours of whirlwind diplomacy, Mr. Bush also talked by telephone with the leaders of four major allies - Britain, France, West Germany and Canada - to discuss the summit conference off Malta next month and the European leaders' meeting scheduled for Paris this weekend, the officials said. **********Mr. Gorbachev sent a cable to Mr. Bush last week saying he endorsed the opening of East Germany's border, the change of leadership in that country and other reforms and expressing the hope that the change would proceed in a ''calm and peaceful'' manner. Agreement on the Language **********Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, used the same words today in announcing that the President replied to that cable on Thursday night, sending his message to the United States Ambassador in Moscow, Jack F.

Trying Not to Rock the Boat **********The exchange of messages had the flavor of a signal between superpowers, and to the world, that neither side would interfere in the events in Eastern Europe. Administration officials said the White House's public pronouncements were deliberately phrased to convey that impression. **********''Neither side wants to rock the boat,'' one official said. ''I don't think that there has been a specific understanding to that effect, but that's what we perceive as the situation with regard to the Soviet Union.'' **********''We worry that they'll change their minds about the reform and they worry that we'll be provocative in Eastern Europe.

Caution on Reunification **********Mr. Bush and other Administration officials have been particularly careful to avoid speculation about reuniting East Germany and West Germany. **********In an interview today with a correspondent for the Mutual and NBC radio networks, Mr. Bush said that is ''a matter for the people of the Germanys to determine.'' **********''It's a highly sensitive matter as far as the Soviet Union is concerned and it's better to leave it right there,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview, which is to be broadcast on Saturday morning. **********Mr. Bush was asked about Europeans who have expressed concerns about the notion of recreating a nation that was divided by the conquering powers at the end of World War II. **********''We've had discussions with countries that expressed concern in this regard because of certain historical precedents,'' Mr. Bush replied.

Advertising for an Astronaut **********Late last month, Saatchi placed an advertisement in several British newspapers that carried the headline: ''Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.'' More than 10,000 men and women have responded, it said. **********If Moscow is successful in this and other commercial ventures, television viewers might see a soft drink or cheeseburger advertised on the side of a Soyuz rocket, while commercials promote a sneaker as the official footwear of the space project. **********''Would you like to have your company's name on a Russian rocket when it goes up?'' asked Art Dula, the president of the Space Commerce Corporation in Houston. ''We can write a contract to do that. We can endorse products for the Soviet space program. We can put signage up at the launch site.'' **********Two weeks ago, Glavkosmos, the Soviet space agency, gave Space Commerce, a small private company, the exclusive right to market its goods and services in the United States. 'Hard Currency' Needed **********Mr. Dula has also signed contracts with Moscow to sell Soviet aerospace technology and bring tourists to Soviet space operations. The Soviet Union is aggressively pursuing space commercialization, he said, ''because their economy badly needs foreign exchange and hard currency.'' **********While the United States has been slowed in its efforts to open space to private ventures because of the difficulties with the shuttle program, Glavkosmos has been negotiating and signing commercial agreements with several Western companies that would make even the most ardent capitalist blush. In March, for example, a Japanese television network paid Glavkosmos $12 million for the right to send a correspondent into space in 1991. And executives at Young & Rubicam, the American advertising agency, which opened an office in Moscow in January, said they had discussed marketing possibilities for the space program with Soviet officials. **********The venture to commercialize the Juno project was announced on June 29 by Glavkosmos and Antequera, a British company established with seed money from the Moscow Narodny Bank to guide British investment in the project. Profit Expected **********Antequera, which hopes to raise $:16 million ($26 million) from commercial agreements involving the space program, hired Saatchi to manage the advertising and marketing of the Juno mission. **********Michael Parker, the deputy managing director of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in London, who is directing the agency's efforts, compared the sale of sponsorships with what is done at the Olympic Games. **********Companies pay ''to associate with the positive profile and characteristics'' of the event, he said. **********Mr. Parker would not disclose the companies with which Saatchi is negotiating sponsorships. But he said the product categories included consumer electronics, clothing and food. **********''There might also be commercial logos on the outside of the ship and on the uniforms,'' he said. **********Mr. Parker said if Antequera raises the $:16 million it is seeking, he believes it would turn a profit after covering its undisclosed payment to Glavkosmos for carrying a British astronaut into space. **********Earlier this year, Saatchi was retained by Gostelradio, the Soviet state broadcasting authority, to advise it on opening its radio and television stations to advertising. **********A Saatchi-owned executive recruiting company, MSL International, is managing the search for the astronaut. Several other Saatchi companies are handling the public relations, the sale of broadcast rights in Britain and elsewhere and the sale of commercial sponsorships. **********The Juno mission is seeking someone 21 to 40 years old with a college degree in biology, engineering, physics or medicine. The successful candidate and an alternate will be trained in the Soviet Union for 18 months. Launching Set for '91 **********The mission is scheduled for early 1991 and is timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space. The British astronaut will spend seven days aboard the Mir space station with two Soviet astronauts. **********Saatchi's London ad agency has even developed the mission's logotype - a flying goose - and gave the mission its name. ''Juno is just one of those words that works,'' said Mr. Parker, the Saatchi executive. ''It has an association with linkups, because Juno is the Roman goddess of marriage.'' **********Mr. Parker said that a fee structure had not yet been established, but that it ''could run a company $:1 million or $:2 million'' for a package that might include the opportunity to use Juno's logotype on products and in ads and the ability to send corporate representatives as spectators to the launching site. **********The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which administers the American space program, does not accept advertising or payments from private citizens for flights.

They are fleeing harsh fighting around Jalalabad, an Afghan Government strongpoint that seems on the brink of falling to the guerrillas. **********As the pressure increases on the Kabul Government's army, ordinary people flee or face an uncertain fate. Soviet bombing, guerrilla attacks and reports of guerrilla looting have uprooted them. **********With Russian troops rushing to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Afghan rebels assert that such cities as Jalalabad and Kandahar are on the verge of collapse. **********While the future remains unknown for the residents, many people fear that the civilians will be caught in the crossfire between the Afghan Army and the guerrillas. And if they survive or escape that, will they then become targets of the rebels' revenge? **********About 3,500 refugees from the Nangarhar region have entered Pakistan this month over the Nawa Pass at the border with Kunar province. In total, more than 20,000 refugees from various regions have entered Pakistan over the last two months, according to the Commission for Afghan Refugees in Peshawar, the Pakistani border city that has served as refuge and headquarters for the Afghan insurgents. Considered Pro-Communist **********The refugees come from villages where the Government maintained militia outposts, and they are regarded as Communist sympathizers. Thus, they receive a mixed welcome from the guerrillas. On the one hand, the guerrilla commanders are trying to help their exodus; on the other, the soldiers often relieve them of their livestock and personal possessions. **********Jalalabad, a city of 60,000, is headquarters for the 11th Division of the Afghan Army. The only thing that saves it from collapse, the guerrillas say, is their own restraint. Before ordering a final assault, the guerrilla commanders say, they must build the basic facilities and services with which to run the city. So far, that has not happened. **********''Jalalabad is more than ready to fall,'' said Walid Majrooh, a commander for the mainstream National Islamic Front of Afghanistan. ''But we have agreed that we will not provoke its fall until there is some sort of a regional government that can take over.'' **********Mr. Majrooh said he had no faith in the efforts by the guerrilla alliance in Peshawar to form an interim administration. In his view, only the commanders fighting in Afghanistan are capable of the task. ''The alliance has never existed for me,'' he said. ''When the alliance spokesman says one thing, the other leaders immediately issue press releases stating their own opinion.'' **********Regional commanders, eager to maintain civilian support, have cut back the rocketing of cities. And in conjunction with leaders in Peshawar, they are looking for ways to relieve food shortages in Kabul and Jalalabad. Fear of Spreading Chaos **********But reports from areas near Jalalabad that fell to the guerrillas this month describe looting and indiscriminate killing of civilians in villages that the militia had controlled. **********''We have expressed our concern with the mujahedeen about these alleged massacres,'' said a Western diplomat in Islamabad, referring to the guerrillas. **********At Nawa Pass, a guerrilla pointed derisively to a small group of men and women making their way on foot. ''They're all Khalqis and Parchamis,'' he said, referring to the two factions of the Afghan Communist Party. ''They only leave now that they know they can't work for Najib.'' Najibullah is the Afghan President. **********''The problem is not so much that we don't want to help them,'' a guerrilla commander said, ''but that we also have to control our mujahedeen. When Shiwa and Khewa fell, there were only 5,000 to 6,000 civilians, and we could to some extent control their movements. But what about when Jalalabad falls?'' ''They can't just disappear in the countryside. The only solution is a neutral zone where civilians can take refuge,'' said a Western aid worker whose organization has projects in the area. But for most guerrilla fighters, the idea of a neutral zone is impossible to grasp. **********Walid Majrooh's men are stationed on the outskirts of Jalalabad. According to him, the guerrillas have required all recent refugees leaving their villages to carry letters of safe passage and guarantees of good character from local commanders. Refugees without them were turned back. ''We'd prefer if they stayed in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Majrooh said. ''We would be willing to relocate them in other villages if their homes have been destroyed.'' **********Commanders around Jalalabad express worry that Pakistani involvement in their affairs may aggravate rivalries among the guerrilla forces and touch off free-for-all fighting for the city. For several months now, commanders in the field have been working on their own at putting together a shura, or representative council, that could govern. **********A similar council has been established under Pakistani guidance in Peshawar, these commanders say. Abdul Kadir, a commander for the Khalis faction of the conservative Hezb-i-Islami, or Islamic Party, declared of this council: ''There are 21 members in all but I've never seen any of them in Nangarhar.'' These newcomers could move into the area and disrupt existing plans. **********Mr. Kadir, controlling the area southeast of Jalalabad, city, agreed the city is ripe to fall, much sooner than Kabul. Govern With What?  ''We could take it in one day, but what would we do with it then?'' he said. He maintained that a council would require at least two weeks more to complete plans to maintain order. **********The commanders also have tried to alleviate the increasingly serious food shortage in Jalalabad. This week, the seven-party alliance sent two convoys, a total of 43 trucks loaded with flour, to the outskirts of the city. This was their first such effort. **********''We have told the people that we have flour and that they can come and get it,'' Mr. Kadir said. ''We don't want deaths in Jalalabad because of food. If the food can go, then it should go.'' The Government forces rocketed the convoy, apparently unsuccessfully, as it neared the city. **********On the border in Nangarhar, preparations are being made to deal with further fighting. And in Kunar's capital of Asadabad, an American physician hopes to set up a mobile unit - a M.A.S.H. - in the now deserted 80-bed hospital."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/16/business/profits-scoreboard-885789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": " **********$      Net Income   Percent        Oct.-Dec.

But in most of the 160 technical papers presented here, the dozens of panel discussions and the major addresses, the worry at this triennial event has shifted from oil embargoes and declining reserves of fossil fuels to urban smog, acid rain and, above all, global warming. **********The question, clearly, is no longer where the fuel will come from - one study released here noted a 30 percent increase in estimated oil reserves in the last three years - but how to use it safely. **********The producers have cause for worry. Industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists believe must be limited to slow global warming, could be 70 percent higher than current levels by 2020, assuming moderate economic growth, according to a major study released today by the World Energy Conference. Changes in the Atmosphere **********''It is unambiguous and beyond doubt that we are changing the composition of the atmosphere by a measurable and important amount,'' said Lord Marshall of Goring, chairman of Britain's Central Electric Generating Board,'' in a keynote address. The program includes an outline for a panel discussion on global warming, listing topics for discussion, but begins by saying, ''The existence of a greenhouse effect is not to be debated.'' **********For such a huge group of energy suppliers to put price, supply and production technology in second place is surprising, many of those present said. John Wakeham, Britain's Secretary of State for Energy, contrasted the concern now with the belief by Western nations in the 1970's that oil and other fuels were dwindling. That, he said, ''has been revealed as a gloomy fantasy and one of the most spectacularly mistaken forecasts of recent history.'' **********But even after the oil glut of 1986 drowned the talk of shortage, the talk did not shift to the environment. ''You would never have heard this three years ago,'' said Elihu Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, a conservation organization based in Washington. ''This conference is symbolically legitimizing what we have known in the States: environmental policy is driving energy policy.'' **********A speech by Lee M. Thomas, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reinforced the point. Mr. Thomas detailed decisions ranging from handling of the wastes from oil drilling to requiring anti-pollution equipment on power plants that cast his agency in the role of making energy policy. In another speech, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made a similar point. ''Environmental sensitivity and economic growth, fueled by energy, go hand in hand,'' he said. ''We no longer have the luxury of trying to have one without the other.'' Growth in Energy Use **********The carbon dioxide study, assembled by 30 experts from 18 countries and 9 international organizations, assumed only a small increase in each person's energy use over the period, but a near-doubling of the population in the third world, from 3.6 billion in 1985 to 6.3 billion in 2020. **********The conference also released a separate study hinting that the reserves of fossil fuels are plentiful. A triennial study of resources found that global recoverable reserves of hard coal are up 80 percent since 1986, oil reserves are up 30 percent and natural gas is up 14 percent. **********What was less clear than supply was where energy policy was being driven. Lord Marshall's prescription was nuclear power, a view that did not create a clear consensus here. Another conflict was between delegates from the third world and the developed countries over who would have to improve energy efficiency to minimize releases of carbon dioxide and other gases. **********Chauncey Starr, the founder and former president of the Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto, Calif., pointed out that each North American uses, on average, seven times as much energy as people of the third world. For ''a huge portion of the world population,'' he said, the primary concerns are ''food supply and enough fuel for cooking and warmth.'' If that population increases its energy consumption only modestly - 2.3 percent a year, Mr. Starr said - the combination of population growth and higher consumption would quadruple world energy demand in 75 years. **********Mr. Starr and others suggested investing in efficiency, especially in the third world; for example, Mr. Starr said, the efficiency of cooking over an open stove is 3 percent, versus 20 percent in a clay oven, a percentage increase far greater than that available in the industrial world. **********But that focus may be wrong, said another delegate, Jassim al-Gumer, director of the economics department at the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Counties, in Kuwait. ''They have such little to spend on pollution, or energy,'' he said of the nonindustrial countries. India, he said, uses a barrel of oil a year for each person, Brazil 3 and the United States 45. ''How much pollution is coming from the 45 barrels versus the one barrel?'' **********For the developing countries that aspire to use more energy, limits on use to slow global warming seem unfair. ''Industrialized countries should recognize that they are to carry the lion's share of the total burden because they consume 80 percent of world energy resources,'' said Bong Suh Lee, the South Korean Minister of Energy Resources. **********More than unfair, it may be impossible, said the British Secretary of State for Energy, John Wakeham. In any international agreement to cut emissions from burning fossil fuels, he said, ''We have to recognize that some backs are broader than others; that costs that are an inconvenience in the developed countries may make the difference between life and death in the third world.'' Allocating the Burden **********But allocating the burden, experts said here, would be difficult. Speaking for the United States, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, sounded distinctly unwilling to take too large a role, or to take substantial action before everyone else agreed. ''The good done by one country is offset by the increased damage done by another,'' he said. **********But the United States and the rest of the world would feel a substantial effect from third-world energy growth, according to the study on energy growth, ''Global Energy Perspectives 2000-2020.'' **********Whether the level of carbon dioxide output represents an unrealistic constraint on the scenario painted by the study was not clear to the participants. Klaus Brendow, the director of the energy commission of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, noted that the scenario assumed that fossil fuels would provide about 80 percent of energy in 2020, down from 88 percent in 1985. ''The risks of a global warming resulting from such a bias are obvious,'' he said, calling for more research into renewable energy. **********The scenario established in the study predicted that with moderate economic growth, third world use of coal would triple between 1985 and 2020; use of oil would double, and use of natural gas would more than triple. Worldwide, the study said, coal use would be up by 51 percent, oil by 66 percent and natural gas by 58 percent. **********It also assumed that the use of nuclear power would more than triple, to account for 7 or 8 percent of energy supplies, compared with 4 now. An estimate by the organization in 1983 had put nuclear at 12 percent by 2020, but it was scaled back because construction has dropped off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/business/the-media-business-advertising-a-japanese-print-ad-from-ammirati-puris.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Japanese Print Ad From Ammirati & Puris", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; A Japanese Print Ad From Ammirati & Puris", "body_text": " **********Ammirati & Puris this week takes its first step toward becoming an international advertising agency -without leaving New York.

Robert Heller said at a meeting of the National Economists Club here. ''You've got to proceed in a prudent fashion - and then you take appropriate policy action.'' **********Mr. Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 1986, spoke at a time when the dollar has been soaring in world currency markets, which has intensified pressure on the central bank to take additional countermeasures. The Fed, on behalf of the Bush Administration and with officials of other industrialized countries, has been trying to hold down the dollar through market intervention to narrow trade imbalances. Considering Many Factors **********When asked directly, after his luncheon address, about pressure to bring down interest rates to help weaken the dollar, Mr. Heller said only that ''that's one factor that we have to take into account.'' **********Since the Fed confirmed earlier this spring that it had halted a yearlong drive to tighten credit, and had adopted a more-or-less neutral stance of waiting and seeing, speculation has focused on when it might decide that the economy had slowed enough to start easing credit, providing some monetary stimulus. **********Although there are reports that some Fed officials have begun to actively consider easing credit, Mr. Heller suggested that such action was not imminent. It is believed that no significant change occurred at last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting arm. The group has not since held a special meeting by telephone, another official said, despite the dramatic rises in the dollar that subsided only today. **********After his reference to moving in ''prudent fashion,'' Mr. Heller mentioned that the next meeting of the committee would be on July 5 and 6, although it was not clear whether he intended to indicate that a decision would be made then. Small Growth in M-2 **********Elaborating on his view of price pressures, Mr. Heller noted that the M-2 money supply, which he called the Federal Reserve's ''principal intermediate target,'' had grown by only 4 percent over the last 12 months and that wage pressures also seemed to be well contained. **********''The raw material for a real surge in inflation isn't there,'' he said. ''It's difficult to see where a major inflationary surge might come from.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Heller added, the United States has the lowest monetary growth rate of any advanced country except for Switzerland. And he said that in retrospect, most other central banks had been ''a little bit too loose'' in expanding their money supplies. **********This relative scarcity of the dollar may have contributed to its recent rise in value against other currencies, Mr. Heller suggested, calling the dollar's value ''an exceedingly important'' one that ''can also convey useful signals.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-agfa-photo-division-uses-mccann-erickson.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AGFA Photo Division Uses McCann-Erickson", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; AGFA Photo Division Uses McCann-Erickson", "body_text": " **********The photo retail division of AGFA Leverkusen, a unit of Bayer G.m.b.H., based near Dusseldorf, West Germany, has retained McCann-Erickson Worldwide to create its advertising for Western Europe.

Why Children Are Scared **********Non-voters are worried too. A survey of Rio and Sao Paulo children aged 8 to 10 found that 80 percent were afraid of ''robbers.'' Only 22 percent said they were afraid of the dark, and only 8 percent said they were afraid of ghosts. **********The transformation is perhaps sharpest in Rio, a South Atlantic beach city long known for a carefree, exuberant way of life. **********Curbing a passion for self-adornment, Rio women now rarely venture into the street with jewelry. Partygoers routinely snap on earrings and strap on watches as they ride in elevators to an apartment. With 100 car thefts a day, car alarms and secret locks are virtually universal. **********Boutique owners in the chic Ipanema beach district increasingly use New York-style buzzer systems to sort out customers on the sidewalk. **********A recent wave of kidnappings has cooled interest in appearing in social columns. Wealthy Cariocas, as Rio residents are called, were chilled by the kidnapping in July of Luis Salles, president of Brazil's third largest advertising company, Salles Inter-Americana de Publicidade. Mr. Salles was released 65 days later, after his family bargained the ransom down to $2.5 million.

Debt Drains the Treasury **********Rio, like much of Brazil, stagnated economically in the 1980's. After strong growth in the late 1960's and 70's, investment in this city, Brazil's second most populous, tailed off in the 1980's. **********The burden of servicing large foreign and internal debts drained billions of dollars from state investment budgets. In addition, because of poor investment conditions here, Brazil's private capital flight is expected to hit $10 billion this year. **********But Rio's population, now about seven million, swells steadily. A second generation of urban slum dwellers enter the work force without the patience, the hope or the social cohesion of their rural-born parents. **********Today, all of Brazil's 22 presidential candidates vow to meet these rising expectations by making the nation grow again. Some advocate spreading the wealth. Others advocate creating the conditions for the creation of new wealth. **********Others, like Paulo Salim Maluf of Sao Paulo, campaign on openly law-and-order platforms. Mr. Maluf is playing on the desire of many Brazilians for drastic action. Death Penalty Favored **********Brazil does not have the death penalty. But in Sao Paulo, where Mr. Maluf was Governor, polls show that three-quarters of respondents favor adoption of the death penalty. **********Lynching and death squads have long existed in Rio's rough neighborhoods. ''Extermination groups,'' generally off-duty policemen paid by shopkeepers, kidnap and kill suspected criminals. **********In recent years, Rio's state government has cracked down on death squad activity and on the use of torture in police investigations. **********''Saboya keeps policemen's hand and feet tied,'' complained a Rio police detective who advocates torture for speeding up criminal investigations. ''You have to beat up a guy to get him to talk. Now he will just say, ''Human rights, human rights.'' **********''I would say that 80 percent of Rio's violent deaths have to do with the drug traffic,'' said Herbert de Souza, who as Rio's official ombudsman fielded complaints from the public until his resignation last month. ''The cocaine traffic involves millions of dollars in very poor areas.'' **********The traffickers, who largely sell to Rio's middle and upper class, are usually members of ruthless, tightly organized gangs. Gang Warfare Is Intense **********Because of intense gang warfare, Father Leising, who has performed social work in Brazil for 30 years, has been unable to visit projects in Dona Marta slum this month. **********''Five people have been killed and 100 people have fled the favela,'' he said, referring to a hillside maze of wooden shacks and open sewers that rises above Rio's middle-class Botafogo neighborhood. **********In Rio's economic panorama, one of the mainstays most affected by crime is international tourism. Next February, thousands of Americans and Europeans are expected to come to celebrate Rio's Carnival, whose theme will be ''Amazonian Fantasy.'' **********Hans Stern, one of the city's top jewelers, recommends that foreign visitors adapt to the times, as Brazilians have. **********''People get their watches and necklaces ripped off,'' Mr. Stern said.

F. King and Georgeson & Company.

Icahn, the takeover artist, entered the business, both King and Georgeson had a long roster of corporate clients. So the Carter Organization promoted its services to the corporate raiders who were not on either company's client list. As a result, the Carter Organization has been the representative of some of the best-known raiders, including Irwin L. Jacobs and T. Boone Pickens. As his reputation has grown, Mr. Carter has won his own roster of corporate clients, including USG, the Bank of New York, the Limited and Allegheny International. **********The Carter Organization also won the reputation of being an expensive operation. When the company began going after clients, it charged rates that Mr. Carter has said were 10 times the industry standard at the time. Those rates were used, Mr. Carter has said, because his company provided premium service. **********The success of the company attracted interest from other investors, and in 1987, Mr. Carter sold his firm to Valin Pollen International P.L.C.,a British advertising agency, for $135 million.

April, with its normally refreshing winds, has finally arrived, yet there is no relief in sight. **********If anything, the air pollution problem here, already the most serious in the world, appears to be worsening, overpowering even natural factors that once held it in check. **********Javier Lopez Moreno, chairman of the environmental committee of the Mexican Congress, recently termed the capital ''a disaster zone'' and described the conditions that the residents of the world's largest city are forced to endure as ''an attack'' on their well-being. Heavy Debt Is a Factor **********To some extent, the Government's ability to act is constrained by budget cuts imposed by Mexico's need to repay its $102 billion foreign debt. Retooling the state oil company to produce gasoline with less pollutants, replacing the fleet of smoke-belching buses that are a major source of public transportation, expanding the subway system or even hiring more people to enforce laws already on the books would all seem at the moment to be measures beyond the country's ability to pay. **********The extent of the problem is daunting. According to a confidential report by the United Nations Environment Program in January, ozone levels here tripled between 1986 and 1988, reaching a median level 60 percent above World Health Organization standards. Levels of Lead Hight **********In 1988, 90 percent of all air samples taken here registered above such limits, and the number of hours each month in which readings exceed ''international norms of ozone tolerance'' is now seven times what it was just three years ago, the document found. **********Levels of lead, four tons of which are deposited in the air daily, according to the estimates of environmentalist groups here, are also taking a toll. The United Nations report found the average lead level in the blood of Mexico City residents to be nearly four times that of a Tokyo resident and more than double the levels found in Baltimore, Stockholm, Lima and Zagreb. **********To this disagreeable soup must be added such other contaminants as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. All told, it adds up to five million tons of chemicals and suspended particles spewed into the air each year, most of it from the 2.8 million vehicles and 36,000 factories here. **********Normally, the spring breezes help disperse the clouds of pollution that tend to form over the city daily from November through March, the period when the thermal inversions that trap the air are most common. But this year, those winds, though unusually strong, have brought additional problems, a result of the high concentration of fecal dust they contain. **********Local medical and environmental groups have lobbied the municipal government to halt growing deforestation on the outskirts of the capital and to plant trees that would act as a barrier to the dust storms common this time of year, demands as yet unheeded. The groups say the winds, carrying the deposited body wastes of about six million people and two million dogs, are a major source of disease. Sewage Service Limited **********Mexico City's population growth long ago passed the city's ability to process sewage, and the 1985 earthquake made the situation even worse by damaging some sections of the system. An estimated 30 percent of the residents of the metropolitan area do not have sewage service and are forced to dispose of their wastes wherever and however they can. **********The United Nations study calculated that 600 tons of solid human waste are dumped into the air daily and found the ''number of colonies of microorganisms per cubic meter of air to be uncountable.'' A partial list of the pathogenic organisms it found in the air includes streptococcus, diplococcus, staphylococcus, salmonella, shigella and amoeba. **********There had been hope that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, both of whom took office on Dec. 1, would mount an immediate and aggressive effort to fight the pollution problem. But critics charge that opportunities have been lost and now say relief is likely to come only with the rains that normally begin late in May or early in June. **********''The President gave an indication in his inaugural address that he intended to do something, but his Minister of Urban Development and Ecology is a politician with no experience and no ecological consciousness,'' said Homero Aridjis, founder of the Group of 100, Mexico's most active and outspoken environmental alliance. ''You can't be learning on the job when 20 million people have their health at stake and are facing a veritable epidemic.'' **********Because air pollution of an intensity and duration comparable to Mexico City's has never been recorded anywhere else, doctors here say it is difficult to gauge the likely permanent effect of the various forms of pollution on human health. But it appears that prolonged exposure to ozone and other chemicals weakens the body's resistance to the pathogenic organisms that are also in the air, doctors say. The primary victims appear to the elderly, especially those with existing respiratory problems, and children. **********Many foreign embassies and companies here have bought or rented houses outside the capital and strongly urge their employees to use such quarters regularly. Some embassies, including those of West Germany and Canada, officially advise diplomats to leave all young children in the home country and not to have a baby while here. **********The average resident of Mexico City, however, has little choice but to adapt his way of life to the conditions around him, following doctor's orders to avoid jogging or outdoor sports and driving with car windows closed even on the hottest days. ''In our family, we try to limit the amount of time we let our children spend outdoors, because we know it's not good for them,'' said Fernando Rueda, a 28-year-old messenger. **********''As for myself, I always wear a mask with a filter when I'm out on the street,'' Mr. Rueda added. ''But mine broke last week, and I went two days without it. Now I've got some kind of infection, which I'm probably going to end up passing on to my baby. It really makes you wonder about the world our children are going to inherit from us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/29/world/greek-coalition-is-to-resign-elections-are-set-for-nov-5.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greek Coalition Is to Resign; Elections Are Set for Nov. 5", "print_headline": "Greek Coalition Is to Resign; Elections Are Set for Nov. 5", "body_text": " **********Just hours after Parliament voted to try former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou for corruption, Greece's conservative-Communist coalition announced today that it would resign by next week and that elections would be held Nov. 5. **********The coalition, which was formed with the sole aim of prosecuting former Socialist ministers accused of involvement in financial scandals, said its cleansing campaign was completed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/16/business/brazil-acts-to-fight-inflation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil Acts To Fight Inflation", "print_headline": "Brazil Acts To Fight Inflation", "body_text": " **********The Brazilian Government announced an indefinite freeze today on prices and wages and a devaluation of about 17 percent as part of a new anti-inflation plan. **********President Jose Sarney said in a national television address: ''I am not presenting an economic program.

It's insanity.'' **********Nor does Mr. Scanlon see any need to merge to serve multinational clients. ''We're a global firm,'' he said. ''We have been for a long time. We have 45,000 people in 100 countries.'' **********For the near term, outsiders concur that Coopers can use the consolidation of others to its advantage, scooping up both clients and disenfranchised talent. But some contend that Coopers will lose out in the long term. **********''Coopers is left out in the cold,'' said David G. Owens, of Chicago, the principal of a firm that serves as consultants to the accounting profession. Mr. Owens contends that scale is accounting's ultimate competitive weapon. ''Twenty years from now, it will be clear they'll have made a horrible, tragic strategic mistake.'' **********But Norman E. Auerbach, Mr. Scanlon's predecessor and one-time rival at Coopers who has since retired, supports Mr. Scanlon's stand. **********''The decision on the part of a number of firms to merge is a poor decision on balance,'' said Mr. Auerbach, ticking off his reasons. Top management loses focus. Managers vie for choice slots on the organization chart. Morale and service suffer. ''Five years from now,'' Mr. Auerbach said of Coopers, a firm that has survived 90 years in the business, ''I don't think there'll be any regret at all.'' **********Also, outsiders say, should Coopers reconsider its decision to go it alone, it still has several options, although none are ideal.: *********** The firm could explore a merger with Peat Marwick or, if one of the pending mergers is called off, with another large firm. Admittedly, availability might not result in the best merger partner. *********** It could approach one of the combined firms about a linkup. But Mr. Scanlon might have a hard time making an attractive deal with a bigger rival. *********** Several smaller accounting firms could be acquired. Coopers would have to swallow two or three second-tier firms to close the $1.5 billion gap expected with the biggest firms. *********** Coopers could also bid for consulting firms, including those that Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency, is selling. Coopers's own consulting practice, responsible for just under one-fifth of its revenues, is well regarded. But expanding it could incite internal battles over allocation of resources and profits. **********Mr. Scanlon rejects the first two options, but says niche mergers remain a possibility - independent Coopers would consider taking over a smaller accounting or consulting firm, as it has in the past. And some outsiders find merit in his strategy. **********''They've got what I would call a respectable critical mass,'' said Andrew Moylan, a consulting partner at Deloitte, Haskins & Sells who once worked for Mr. Scanlon at Coopers. ''They may indeed be big enough to go it on their own.'' INDEED, while small in comparison to the top firms - about half the size a combined Andersen and Price Waterhouse would be in terms of international revenues for 1988 - Coopers is well above the next tier of accounting firms. Coopers's international revenues last year were $2.5 billion, compared with $783 million for BDO Binder, the next largest. **********Reminded that 10 years ago Coopers was the world's biggest accounting firm, Mr. Scanlon said that having to explain how the firm lost that ranking is precisely why Coopers no longer craves such recognition and now releases almost no financial information to the public. Currency fluctuations were responsible, he says. Coopers derived a relatively high percentage of its business overseas, but when the dollar strengthened, the value of the overseas revenues fell. **********Bill Timm, chief financial officer of Valhi Inc., a Coopers auditing client, agreed that Coopers might be big enough already. ''We do business in over 120 countries,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean Coopers has to be in that many countries.'' But some former Coopers clients voice general dissatisfaction. ''Honestly, I wasn't satisfied with the service we got,'' said Michael Goldberger, the sales manager for Movie Star Inc., a New York lingerie maker and former client. Coopers, he said, advised the troubled company to spend large sums moving its computers from its Poplarville, Miss., plant to Tampa, Fla., where it could get superior support from a nearby I.B.M. plant. Movie Star has since been sold to Sanmark-Stardust, a large publicly traded competitor. ''When the new people bought this company,'' Mr. Goldberger said, ''that was the first thing they closed.'' Coopers also lost Dominion Resources to Deloitte, Haskins & Sells in late 1987 when the Richmond utility ended an auditing relationship spanning three decades that Mr. Scanlon once personally managed. Dominion was diversifying out of the regulated electric utility business and wanted an auditor that could also monitor oil and gas exploration and real estate development. **********Mr. Scanlon, making no excuses, said, ''If we did the job right, I don't think the client would be looking.'' **********But within the firm Mr. Scanlon, who rose through the auditing ranks, wins high marks. Mr. Auerbach, who defeated Mr. Scanlon for the top post in 1976 but was not eligible for re-election in 1982 and saw Mr. Scanlon win, said: ''Regardless of what I may have felt at that time, I have been pleased with Peter's performance, and some of the concerns I might have had never materialized. He's done a superb job.'' **********Mr. Scanlon edged out two other top contenders - William J. Holland, the partner Mr. Auerbach was thought to favor, and Eugene M. Freedman. An astute politician, he brought both men into his close circle of advisers, insiders recall. **********Mr. Scanlon, who is 58 years old and a Bronx-born graduate of Iona College, has twice been re-elected unopposed, but he will not stand again when his term ends in 1991 because the firm has a mandatory retirement age of 62. **********SINCE taking over, Mr. Scanlon has built up Coopers's existing operations, rather than opening new offices, and in the process has steered the firm's profitability closer to that of the other big firms. Average partner compensation has more than doubled since 1982, to more than $200,000 a year, he says, while revenue per partner grew to $950,000 in the United States last year, from $600,000 in 1982. **********But Mr. Scanlon dismisses this as inside baseball. ''None of the clients have ever expressed curiosity in our firm's profitability,'' he said. ''What they are interested in is stability.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-dmb-b-a-titanic-back-on-top.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "D.M.B.&B.: A 'Titanic' Back on Top", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; D.M.B.&B.: A 'Titanic' Back on Top", "body_text": " **********WHEN D'Arcy MacManus Masius and Benton & Bowles joined forces in 1985, London's advertising community predicted disaster. **********British agencies have not always taken well to American-induced mergers. Corporate cultures that seem so complementary in the United States have sometimes turned out to be hopelessly conflicting in London. What similarities existed between Masius, as the agency was known, and B.&B. were not encouraging. Both were considered boring and static. Chris Wilkins, then creative director of Young & Rubicam's London office, even told Campaign, Britain's advertising trade magazine, that the merger creating D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles was ''like airlifting passengers off the Titanic in the Hindenburg.'' **********Three years later, D.M.B.&B. Ltd. in London has answered its critics with a growth record that has been the envy of the agency business - up 31 percent in billings last year - and advertising that has impressed the haughty creative community here. **********The agency even managed to get itself voted Campaign's agency of the year for 1987, an honor that had eluded virtually all the multinational agency branches here. D.M.B.&B. remains the incumbent; Campaign considered British advertising so lackluster last year that it did not choose an agency of the year. **********D.M.B.&B.'s turnaround here, based in large part on creative awards that led to new business from both existing and new clients, may hint at what the ad agency's United States president, Clayton Wilhite, is planning for the domestic division. **********While the American merger went smoothly, D.M.B.&B.U.S.A. still suffers from a reputation for creative dullness. Mr. Wilhite, who once served as marketing director of Young & Rubicam in London, has vowed to improve the firm's creative reputation, and recently changed the agency's research structure to resemble the British model of account planning, where researchers and creative people work closely on strategy development from an ad campaign's inception. **********That D.M.B.&B. London should be a model for anything is a shock to the agency system here. The 1985 merger spurred $:15 million worth of business to edge out the door immediately because of client conflicts. **********''The merger was a disaster,'' said J. Christopher Powell, chairman of BMP Davidson Pearce, a leading agency here, recalling the common sentiment at the time. ''The loss of business, personnel and morale was the most extreme London's ever seen. But they hired two blokes who turned it around.'' **********The two blokes were Tony Douglas and Graham Hinton, who had actually been appointed co-chief executives at Masius three weeks before the merger. **********Mr. Hinton, who is 43 years old, a dark, long-haired, impulsive man, said he and his silver-haired partner had actually benefited from the sorry mess they inherited. ''We came in with impunity,'' he said. ''The shambles had nothing to do with us.'' **********Part of their resurrection strategy involved winning awards - a tactic similar to that of the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott when it started out in 1980. In London, most of the multinational offices had skipped the competition. **********''I think awards are critical here,'' said Mr. Douglas, 44, explaining the plan. ''People want to work for award-winning agencies here. You can lure the best copywriters.'' **********In 1987, D.M.B.&B. had its work featured in the prestigious British Design and Art Direction annual for the first time in 20 years. And nine months ago, the agency attracted Tony Brignull, 51, one of London's best-known copywriters, from the long-renowned creative agency Collett Dickenson Pearce, to become its creative director. **********''The work had a vigor to it, a zest,'' said Mr. Brignull of his decision to join. ''It was a very British story, this agency fighting itself out of a corner.'' **********D.M.B.&B.'s work reveals both the wry humor and the cinematic production techniques that exemplify the best of British advertising. A new television commercial that will be introduced today for the Water Authorities Association, which is soon to be sold to investors, uses computer graphics and dramatic visuals to follow a raindrop from a cloud through the sky to a lake, through a purification station and miles of pipes into a young boy's water glass. **********Messrs. Hinton and Douglas have also gone one up on the naysayers. After Mr. Wilkins of Young & Rubicam made his comment about the Hindenburg and the Titanic, D.M.B.&B.'s executives placed an ad in Campaign asserting that he would soon eat his words. To help him, they even included his comment printed on a piece of rice paper. **********In late 1987, they invited him to lunch, where Mr. Wilkins obligingly ate his words. It was all captured on film and published in Campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/07/world/legacy-of-mao-called-great-disaster.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 708, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Legacy of Mao Called 'Great Disaster'", "print_headline": "Legacy of Mao Called 'Great Disaster'", "body_text": " **********In one of the harshest official appraisals so far of Mao Zedong, a leading Chinese newspaper has said he brought great disasters to the Chinese people. **********Guangming Daily, an official paper with a largely intellectual audience, also said China should not flinch from re-examining the legacy of the man who molded Chinese Communism. **********The long critique, which took up nearly half a page in Thursday's issue, has aroused attention in Beijing because it appeared to have official backing and may be a sign of a greater willingness to assess Mao's record. **********The article was written by Li Rui, a former Government official who is one of 200 members of the prestigious Central Advisory Commission to the Chinese Communist Party. Statues No Longer in Vogue **********The article reflected the general decline in esteem for Mao, who dominated China's Communist Party from its days as a rebel organization in the late 1930's until his death in 1976. In his later years his cult was extraordinary not only for the number of its followers but often for their zeal. **********In the last decade, China has moved away from Mao's beliefs, and his pictures and statues have largely disappeared from around the country. When a three-story statue of Mao was removed last year from Beijing University, it left only a handful of Mao statues in various nooks of the capital. **********Yet China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, was reported to have said in 1978, ''We will never do to Mao what the Soviets did to Stalin,'' and the official verdict remains that Mao was 70 percent correct and 30 percent wrong. Reassessing Mao's role in China is far more complex than re-evaluating Stalin's position in Soviet history, because Mao dominated China's Communist Party for so long that without him there is not much left to praise. Mistakes in His Thought' **********The article in Guangming Daily praised Mao's achievements, particularly in his early years, and said he was without doubt the greatest Chinese figure of the 20th century. But it added: **********''In studying Mao Zedong, the most complicated, difficult and important area is the examination of the activities and thought of his later years -especially the mistakes in his thought. There has been little study of this in the past. Mao was a great man who embodied the calamities of the Chinese people, but in his later years he made big mistakes over a long period, and the result was great disaster for the people and his country. He created a historical tragedy.'' **********Mr. Li added that it was unfortunate that study by Chinese scholars of Mao's later years had lagged behind study by foreign scholars. Other Articles on Mao **********There have been other articles in the last year suggesting that a quiet reappraisal of Mao is under way. One of the most startling, originally published last summer in Science and Technology Daily and later in Beijing Review, suggested that Mao wanted to be cremated after his death. **********Since Mao instead was embalmed and placed on display in a vast memorial hall in the center of Beijing, some people thought that article was intended as a suggestion that it was finally time to cremate Mao's body and close the memorial hall. **********An article in Shanghai's World Economic Herald in December recalled a series of crackdowns on intellectuals in the last 30 years and added, ''Personality cult and despotism once caused us much suffering, impaired the development of Marxism and even plunged Marxism into crisis.'' **********While ''Mao Zedong thought'' remains a cornerstone of Chinese Marxism, officials have undertaken the delicate task of explaining that ''Mao Zedong thought'' is not necessarily what Mao himself thought, but rather the thought of the movement he led. **********The ''little red book'' of Mao quotations, once ubiquitous in China and even abroad, today is long out of print. An intellectual who was persecuted under Mao boasted that her collection of Mao buttons, which she once found hateful, now is quite valuable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/business/business-people-utility-executive-ready-to-roll-up-his-sleeves.html": {"writer_name": "Harriet King", "pub_date": "1989-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utility Executive Ready To Roll Up His Sleeves", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Utility Executive Ready To Roll Up His Sleeves", "body_text": " **********On election night in November, a power failure blacked out The Idaho Statesman newspaper office in Boise, which had been serving as the headquarters for reporting the state's computerized election returns.

Now that we can come and go, why should we leave?'' **********They said they had met a former countryman who had fled East Germany through Czechoslovakia only a week ago, one of the more than 200,000 people who had left this year before last weekend. **********''We were waiting for a bus, and he recognized me by my East German cigarettes,'' Mr. Rohr said. ''He told us that if he'd known they were going to let everybody come and go, he would have stayed here.'' Reception Centers in East **********The East German state radio reported tonight that the country was preparing four emergency reception centers for ''thousands'' of people who were expected to return after living in the West, something that made the Rohrs' next door neighbor, Irene Runge, laugh. **********''The people who left were the ones who didn't accept the system anyway,'' Mrs. Runge said. ''I think we just have to live with the fact that they've gone.'' **********How long people like the Rohrs will continue to feel that it is better to stay here at home than to leave is another matter. Life in the crumbling gray five-story apartment buildings in their neighborhood, historically a strongly working-class area, will never seem the same again now that their eyes have been opened to what is on the other side, they said. **********''The biggest surprise was the fresh strawberries,'' Mr. Rohr said, ''and fresh asparagus and fruits I had never seen before, kiwis.'' **********''It's really like night and day,'' his wife agreed. ''We were simply cooped up over here for 28 years.'' **********They came back this afternoon with the beer, canned vegetables, some popular-music records, soap, shampoo and a cut-glass ashtray, bought with the 100 West German marks, a little over $50, they each got in ''welcome money.'' The Bonn Government provides every East German visitor with that much once a year. **********''I went to a bank over there and wanted to change 15 marks of our money,'' Mr. Rohr said. ''It would have been worth 1.5 West German marks, but the woman at the counter told me I didn't need to change any -she'd give me the 100 marks right then.'' Saving for Candy **********They will save some of the money, they said, to go back before Christmas to buy candy, which is short in supply and poor in quality here. **********The East German Government provides people going west with 15 West German marks - about enough for two lunches at a snack bar - but only once a year. ''I thought it was every time you went,'' Mr. Rohr said. **********The new freedom to go to the West was, Mr. Rohr said, the only thing anybody was talking about now. It seemed almost unavoidable that every time an East German went across for another look, the question of whether to come back again would arise. **********''I wouldn't go, if only because it took us 3,000 marks to put this carpet in this apartment, and if we left, the whole thing would go to the state,'' Mrs. Rohr said. ''I have no intention of leaving anything to the Government.'' **********Mrs. Runge, a 47-year-old writer who lived in New York City as a child but has lived here since her German Jewish parents decided to return when the Communist state was established in 1949, remembered how things were before the wall was built in 1961. Recalls Jerusalem Visit **********''People were leaving by the hundreds every morning, and you couldn't buy anything in the stores here because black marketeers were taking subsidized goods and selling them for much higher prices in the West,'' she said. ''I thought the wall was a hope in a way for those of us who stayed then, but that was wrong.'' **********A teacher of ethnography at Humboldt University, she spent six weeks this fall in Jerusalem. **********''You don't have to have a wall to have a divided city,'' she said. ''Jerusalem and Belfast show that.'' **********''All the time I was in Jerusalem,'' she said, ''people were talking about how the wall had come down there in 1967, when the Israelis knocked it down between East and West Jerusalem, but look what's happened since then.'' **********''The wall is not the thing,'' she said.

Details of the default were made public this week by Real Estate Finance Today, a publication of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, and confirmed today by Federal officials. **********The agency, known as Ginnie Mae, took control of the loan portfolio after Heights of Texas, a Houston-based Federal savings bank that holds the servicing contract on it, failed to pay $15 million owed to investors in the loans. **********The default, the agency's fifth in two years, is indicative of the severe strains that real estate problems are putting on the financial system of the Southwestern region. Difficulty in the Business **********''Servicing of these mortgages has become more difficult,'' said James M. Wooten, chairman of the mortgage banking division of the Lomas & Nettleton Financial Corporation. ''It's not worth what it was. If there is a proliferation of those failures, it could be a burden to the system. They have to have enough capital to carry the business.'' **********Telephone calls seeking comment were not returned by officials of Heights, which was formed last September from four insolvent savings institutions under the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation's Southwest Plan. There was also no response to calls to officials of the Pulte Home Corporation of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which owns Heights. Pulte acquired Heights with a $45 million investment aided by $556.9 million in Government assistance. **********A spokesman for Ginnie Mae, Jack Flynn, said the agency made a $15 million payment to investors to cover the shortfall and that another $36 million would be paid in March. A savings association in Gaithersburg, Md., the Standard Federal Savings Bank, has begun servicing the portfolio, which is made up of 52,000 residential mortgage loans concentrated in the Houston and El Paso areas. After evaluation by the Maryland institution, the portfolio will be resold to the highest bidder, Mr. Flynn said. No Problem for Investors **********Investors in Ginnie Mae's roughly $500 billion of insured securities have nothing to fear from the service companies' problems, because the loans carry full Government backing. But the institutions marketing the securities are seeing their problems grow because of devaluation in the real estate market. Forced to maintain payments to investors despite lack of income, they have watched their net worths dissipate. **********In some cases mismanagement has contributed to the institutions' problems, Government officials said. **********''If payments are delinquent, then you still have to put the check in the mail,'' said Mr. Wooten, whose company has taken over several Ginnie Mae portfolios from troubled institutions in recent years. **********Ginnie Mae confirmed this week that it was devising new ways to strengthen its surveillance efforts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/world/the-malta-summit-us-shift-on-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1989-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Malta Summit; U.S. Shift on Arms Talks", "print_headline": "The Malta Summit; U.S. Shift on Arms Talks", "body_text": " **********President Bush's decision to try to complete a strategic arms treaty with Moscow before the next summit meeting in June marks an important shift in his thinking on arms control. **********Until recently, Mr. Bush and his advisers had steadfastly refused to set such a goal, saying negotiating against a deadline could put the United States at a disadvantage in the arms talks, which deal with long-range nuclear weapons. **********In contrast, the President had no similar qualms about setting an early goal for completing an accord cutting conventional forces in Europe. And his different approaches to these two sets of talks had raised questions about how interested the Bush Administration really was in finishing the strategic arms treaty, which was largely negotiated by the Reagan Administration. **********At the Malta summit meeting, however, Mr. Bush put strategic arms negotiations on a fast track. And in another shift, he backed away from his contentious decision to keep the option of producing chemical weapons after a worldwide treaty is reached to phase them out. Advised of Complications **********Asked at Malta about his goals for June's summit meeting, which will probably be in Washington, the President said of the strategic arms reduction talks: ''I think we should shoot for a Start treaty. I'm advised by some of the pros that that's complicated. But look, I think we ought to go forward and try to get a Start agreement.'' **********Appearing from Malta on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was more cautious, saying he hoped that an agreement in principle could be reached by the meeting, leaving technical details to be completed over the next several months. **********Supporting its public statements, the Bush Administration said on Saturday night that Mr. Baker would go to Moscow next month to try to overcome remaining differences on a variety of strategic arms issues. **********The reason Mr. Bush is pushing to complete the strategic arms accord by June involves a number of political as well as foreign policy considerations. **********In light of the sweeping political changes in Eastern Europe, the Administration appears less concerned with the potential opposition of the conservative wing of the Republican Party to a strategic arms treaty. Meeting Gorbachev's Needs **********In foreign policy terms, Mr. Bush's decision to move ahead with the talks is an effort to give a further boost to American-Soviet relations by meeting Mr. Gorbachev's needs. A senior Administration official recently told reporters that the Kremlin has assigned top priority to wrapping up a strategic arms accord, in part because the Soviet leader wants to show the Soviet military that he has succeeded in reducing the American military threat. **********Beyond that, the Administration appears to have discovered that the American-Soviet strategic arms talks are easier to manage than the 23-nation East-West negotiations on cutting conventional arms, in which every new Western proposal must be coordinated among disputatious allies. Progress in the conventional arms talks has been held up recently by differences between the United States and West European nations over how much verification is needed and by disputes between Greece and Turkey. **********The pace of the strategic arms talks is not the only issue on which the President appears to have changed his thinking. On chemical weapons, he backed away from his decision to preserve the option of producing advanced chemical weapons even after a worldwide treaty phasing them out enters force. **********His earlier decision was made at the behest of the Pentagon, which argued that the United States needed to have a stock of new chemical weapons as a hedge against nations that might violate or refuse to join a global ban on poison gas. This policy drew objections from some Western European nations and the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Bush said in Malta that he was willing to stop the production of advanced chemical weapons when a global treaty goes into effect if Moscow accepted his United Nations proposals on chemical weapons issues. Interest in Troop Cuts **********Speaking at the United Nations in September, Mr. Bush suggested that Washington and Moscow start to slash their chemical arsenals before a worldwide ban is negotiated. He also said the United States would keep 2 percent of its chemical weapons after a global treaty banning them takes effect until all nations capable of making poison gas join the accord. **********On conventional arms, Administration officials expressed hope of signing an accord at an East-West meeting of heads of state next year. Mr. Bush told reporters today that Mr. Gorbachev was ''very much interested in seeing troop cuts'' beyond conventional forces in Europe. **********The Administration's interest in further troop cuts has grown with pressure for Pentagon budget cuts. Withdrawing 100,000 Army troops from Europe and shrinking the service by that number could save the Pentagon about $5 billion a year, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate that does not include possible procurement savings. **********Mr. Bush's decision to put the strategic arms talks on a fast track does not mean all the obstacles will be easily surmounted. **********The list of issues that Administration officials said Mr. Baker wants to tackle on his trip to Moscow includes limits on air-launched cruise missiles, limits on stored missiles and provisions banning the encoding of electronic missile signals during tests. Notably absent is sea-launched cruise missiles, an important Soviet concern. **********Moscow has said verifiable limits should be established on such weapons under a side agreement to a strategic arms treaty.

New Laws Are Planned **********The announcement of a new environmental program, planned for April 6, is being billed as a major event and the President's office is mustering prestigious foreign guests to come to give weight to the ceremony. **********President Jose Sarney will propose far-reaching new laws affecting the Amazon, said Fernando Cesar Mesquita, the head of the Government's newly formed environmental agency. The measures will include a drastic change in the tax system, a ban on deforestation for agriculture and cattle and controls on the sale of mercury, with which hundreds of thousands of gold prospectors have been polluting the rivers. **********There are also plans to enlist the help of the army and the air force in the coming dry season to diminish the huge forest fires that farmers set to clear the land. **********Mr. Sarney's program is expected to be an expanded version of steps he announced last October after a rush of international protests against devastation in the Amazon. At the time, he called for a new Amazon policy to be formulated by mid-February. That deadline passed and the new policy is now due in April. Subsidies Spur Deforestation **********Although environmentalists contend that the poorly staffed and equipped Government agencies will have great difficulty in putting new rules into effect in a region larger than Europe, proposed changes in the laws and tax breaks could make a significant difference. According to a recent World Bank study, official subsidies over the last decade have made ranching in the Amazon artificially profitable. The study said that from 1975 to 1986 the Brazilian Government in effect promoted vast deforestation and ecological damage with subsidies for ranchers and settlers totaling more than $1 billion. **********Yet a basic conflict in the Government's response on the Amazon -bowing to foreign pressure to take the environment into account while condemning outside interference - is increasingly evident. **********At a military ceremony this month, Mr. Sarney made his strongest statement yet as he told the armed forces high command that ''now more than ever'' they had the ''mission'' to defend the Amazon. **********''Brazil is being threatened in its sovereign right to use, exploit and administer its territory,'' the President said. ''Every day brings new forms of intervention, with veiled or explicit threats aiming to force us to take decisions that are not in our interest.'' **********He said the industrialized nations were conducting ''an insidious, cruel and untruthful campaign'' against Brazil to distract attention from their own large-scale pollution, acid rain and ''fantastic nuclear arsenals'' that threaten life. The Specter of Occupation **********By ''intervention,'' Mr. Sarney was apparently referring to foreign credits that have either been postponed or conditioned on environmental measures as well as recent proposals from countries including the United States, the Netherlands and France that Brazil exchange discounted parts of its foreign debt for conservation projects. Most recently, at a high-level environmental conference in the Netherlands this month Brazil successfully fought against a plan to form an international environmental agency that it feared could intervene in the Amazon. **********''There is a true danger of foreign occupation of the Amazon,'' Mr. Mesquita said. ''We are seeing a concerted international effort to hold back development in Brazil.'' **********When asked to explain this danger, officials offer various conspiracy theories. One is that the rich countries do not want Brazil to develop its vast mineral deposits, its gold, tin, bauxite and uranium, because this would affect their industrial interests and depress world prices. Another theory is that the big multinational companies are using environmental concerns to postpone exploitation of the Amazon's wealth until they themselves can gain control of it. **********The President himself has described environmentalism as ''a Trojan horse'' that hides other interests and ''uses the pure spirit of the young people'' for economic ends. The Target of Hostility **********Leaders of Brazil's fast-growing environmental movement say they have recently become the target of deep hostility from official circles. **********''These days officials are treating me like an anti-patriot, a traitor,'' said Fabio Feldmann, the only member of Congress elected on an environmental platform. **********A group of conservative Brazilian senators have even created a parliamentary commission of inquiry to investigate the motives behind the world's heightened interest in the Amazon. Some liberals, including Mr. Feldmann, say they are supporting the inquiry because they feel it will debunk the ''foreign conspiracy myth.'' **********The Government conspiracy theories have so far not been adopted by Brazilian newspapers and television, which are themselves becoming increasingly environment-minded. But the slogan ''the Amazon is ours'' is used widely by the Rural Democratic Union, a right-wing movement of landowners, and by members of Congress who have ties with the construction companies that have large stakes in the continuing development of the Amazon. Governors Welcome Outcry **********Critics of Mr. Sarney and foreign diplomats here say the President has taken to beating a nationalist drum to rally support for a Government that is weak and discredited. **********In contrast, the governors of the states of the Amazon Basin have made it clear that they welcome the outcry over the Amazon abroad because the federal Government has traditionally ignored their problems. **********''This is the first time Brasilia is taking the Amazon seriously and consulting us,'' Amazonino Mendes, the Governor of Amazonas, told reporters at a recent meeting of the region's governors in Manaus. Mr. Mendes said the notion of foreign intervention was ''absurd'' and added that he and his colleagues, whose treasuries are empty, welcomed any foreign funds. **********Last month, an uproar over plans for a new highway - from the west Amazonian state of Acre into Peru -illustrated Brasilia's sensitivity. The Governor of Acre, Flaviano Melo, has said that while Brasilia was never interested, he discussed construction of the road 18 months ago in Tokyo with officials of the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, who showed great interest. He added that although he had also discussed the project with Japanese diplomats who have visited Acre since then, no official loan request had been made because a viability study that had been asked was not completed. Japan Denies Involvement **********After the highway project was reported in the United States, President Bush used the occasion of Emperor Hirohito's funeral to urge the Japanese authorities not to finance a road that environmentalists said could speed destruction of the jungle. Japan then strongly denied any involvement in the project. Indignant to see the United States and Japan discussing Brazil's future, Mr. Sarney declared the road to be a national priority and said it would be built with or without foreign financing. **********The large public relations event planned for the announcement of the new Amazon policy has drawn bitter criticism from Brazilian scientists. It has been disclosed that the President's office has appropriated $2 million for the event, much of it to be spent on air fares and Amazon visits for guests. **********This has rankled scientists because across-the-board budget cuts have badly hurt all research related to the Amazon. At the National Institute for Space Research, which processes satellite images that register Amazon fires and deforestation, for example, researchers said they had not been able to finish analyzing last year's data because there was no money to repair a broken computer or even to develop the film. **********Forest wardens in Rondonia state complained last month that there was no money for fuel or spare parts for their vehicles. During severe forest fires in Bahia state this month, the Forestry Institute said it had only 50 men to combat a blaze covering thousands of acres. **********''Who does Sarney think he is kidding with all this public relations stuff?'' one frustrated scientist said. **********But opponents contend that until the elections in November the Sarney Government is likely to use the ''foreign threat'' to the Amazon as a rallying point. The President has now closely involved the military chiefs of staff in all deliberations on Amazon issues. The military has opposed any proposals that foreigners pay for or create nature reserves in the Amazon. Double Standard Charged **********The Government has also ordered its diplomats to go on a counteroffensive. At a meeting in Ecuador this month, Brazil succeeded in enlisting other Amazon Basin countries - Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela - to repudiate outside interference in the Amazon. **********''What infuriates us is the double standard,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official who still felt rankled by recent sharp criticism of Brazil by France, a country that he said had ''no enchanting environmental record.'' Also, he said, Brazil was rebuffed when at the conference on chemical weapons in Paris late last year it tried to introduce a clause in the final resolution saying chemical weapons were also extremely harmful to the environment. **********''We were told that was too controversial,'' the official said. ''So we say, all right, let's discuss the environment, the Amazon. But not just the Amazon, but the whole agenda, the whole industrial model we are all a part of.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/15/business/profits-scoreboard-526789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/14/business/corona-awarded-gold-mine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corona Awarded Gold Mine", "print_headline": "Corona Awarded Gold Mine", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court of Canada has awarded the country's richest gold mine to the Corona Corporation, ending an eight-year legal battle and freeing the mine's new owners to explore for gold. **********Most exploration at the Page-Williams mine in northern Ontario has been suspended since March 1986, when a lower court ruled that LAC Minerals Ltd., which is based in Toronto, had used confidential information supplied by Corona to obtain the mine. **********Page-Williams has proven and probable ore reserves of 37.5 million tons, containing about a million ounces of gold.

Tower took a public pledge of sobriety today in an extraordinary effort to salvage his nomination as Secretary of Defense and promised to resign if he ever took a drink. **********''I hereby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as Secretary of Defense, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form,'' Mr. Tower said, reading from a written statement on three occasions.  [ Text page B8. ]  Earlier in a day of high political drama, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, raised another hurdle to Mr. Tower's confirmation, saying that his financial ties to the defense industry might disqualify Mr. Tower even if he foreswore alcohol. Senate Conversions Sought **********Mr. Nunn also accused the White House of disclosing misleading, edited accounts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation report of Mr. Tower's character and threatened to reopen the committee's public hearings on Mr. Tower's fitness if the activity continued. The committee voted against the nomination Thursday, and the full Senate is expected to vote this Thursday. **********Awaiting President Bush's return from Asia Monday, a skeleton staff at the White House seemed hard-pressed to keep up with the developments. Although Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, spoke of converting Senate Democrats to Mr. Tower's cause, the White House lobbying effort was faced with the prospect that as many as 5 of the Senate's 45 Republicans might be wavering in their support of Mr. Tower. **********The struggle seemed likely to poison the atmosphere of bipartisanship that has prevailed since Mr. Bush was inaugurated, even though Mr. Bush himself seemed anxious to prevent such a development.  [ Page B8. ]  Accusations Levelled White House officials today accused Mr. Nunn and other Senate Democrats of acting out of a desire to cripple and humiliate the new President. **********The man at the center of the storm, the former Senator from Texas, stunned the Capital by appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week With David Brinkley'' this morning to defend himself against allegations of alcoholism and sexual misconduct. He offered President Bush a way out of the tempest by saying he would withdraw the instant he became convinced that he was an embarrassment to the Administration, but vowed otherwise to continue the fight. **********Holding himself in tight control and displaying only occasional flashes of anger as he ended a public silence of more than three weeks, Mr. Tower offered his pledge of temperance twice more: on Cable News Network's ''Newsmaker Sunday'' and before reporters and photographers on the sidewalk outside the ABC studios in downtown Washington. 'To Allay Any Fears or Doubts' **********''I have never been an alcoholic nor dependent on alcohol,'' Mr. Tower said, reading from a sheet of paper on which his pledge was neatly typed in two paragraphs and witnessed by the Secretary of Transportation, Samuel K. Skinner, and the Congressional physician, William M. Narva. **********''However, to allay any fears or doubts on this matter, I hereby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as Secretary of Defense, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form, including wine, beer or spirits of any kind,'' Mr. Tower said. **********A doctor's letter saying that Mr. Tower showed no signs of alcoholism accompanied the written vow, and the nominee said that if he broke his pledge, ''I think I'd be obliged to resign.'' **********''I've never broken a pledge in my life,'' Mr. Tower said, brushing off a suggestion by his interviewers that the vow was an acknowledgement that he had a drinking problem. **********Administration officials said the White House had not asked Mr. Tower to make the vow, an unusual concession to public and political pressure by a prospective Cabinet official. The officials said he came up with the idea himself after consulting with two confidants, Rhett Dawson, director of the Pentagon transition team, and William L. Ball 3d, the Navy Secretary. 'Clear Abuse' Asserted **********Mr. Tower also sought the advice of J. Daniel Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, before he placed a call to China to outline his plans to John H. Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff, who was with Mr. Bush. **********It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Tower's vow would influence the Senate's vote on his nomination. Some influential Democratic Senators appeared impressed by Mr. Tower's appearance on national television. **********The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said at a news conference today that Mr. Tower's pledge was ''a factor that of course all of us will have to consider and we will.'' **********Mr. Nunn declined through a spokesman to comment on Mr. Tower's pledge. But he said in an earlier appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that there was ''clear abuse of alcohol'' by Mr. Tower in the 1970's and that he had never seen a point at which the Texan acknowledged a problem and took steps to correct it. Mr. Nunn also criticized White House officials for showing parts of the F.B.I. report to reporters over the last week, saying they were picking only those parts of the report that were favorable to Mr. Tower. New Hearings Seen Possible **********If such activity continued, Mr. Nunn said, he might reopen his committee's hearings on Mr. Tower this week. **********''I hope we don't have to do that,'' Mr. Nunn said. ''I will do everything possible not to have to open up the hearings, but if they continue to leak out information which is inaccurate to the American public, then we may have no choice.'' **********Mr. Nunn added later that it was ''a mistake to focus simply on alcohol.'' **********Mr. Nunn said Mr. Tower's work as a consultant to a half-dozen major military contractors, for which his company was paid more than $1 million dollars over about two years, ''is just as important in the minds of many Senators.'' 'Tough Line to Draw' **********Mr. Nunn noted that after Mr. Tower had served as a negotiator on strategic arms reduction in Geneva, the nominee had advised companies on the impact of arms control efforts on the weapons they manufacture. Mr. Nunn said that Mr. Tower had been privy to the most sensitive American negotiating policies and that his decision to work as a consultant was therefore ''very questionable.'' **********''It's a tough line to draw,'' he conceded. ''But I do believe that John Tower crossed that line.'' **********In the ABC program, a combative 25 minutes in which Mr. Tower and three questioners fenced about the propriety of his consulting contracts, his drinking and his relationships with women in a way that sometimes turned personal, Mr. Tower angrily denied that his consulting work was improper. **********''Are you suggesting that I divulged classified information?'' he said to Cokie Roberts, an ABC correspondent, in an appearance that the host, Sam Donaldson, extended beyond its scheduled time. ''If you are suggesting that, I totally reject it.'' 'Righteous Indignation' **********Mr. Tower said he thought there was ''a little bit too much righteous indignation'' in Senators' objections to his consulting work since many legislators receive honorariums and campaign contributions from special-interest groups and often work after retiring from the Senate as lobbyists or Washington lawyers. **********''I think what you're doing is establishing a double standard here, one against which you judge me and one against which you judge a number of other former members who've gone out in the world and have made money,'' he said. **********Aiming a personal barb at Ms. Roberts, Mr. Tower said he did not think his company's $1 million in consulting fees was unreasonable. ''I think, Cokie, if you asked your brother if that's an exorbitant amount for experienced consultants in this town, I think he would tell you that it is certainly not exorbitant,'' **********Ms. Roberts' brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a leading Washington lobbyist and lawyer, a senior partner in the firm of Patton Boggs and Blow. Carefully Chosen Words **********Mr. Tower was vehement in contending that he would continue his fight for nomination despite the odds against him. **********''If I thought that it would benefit the Administration, I would be glad to withdraw,'' Mr. Tower said. ''However, the President doesn't feel that way; the President wants to proceed with this.'' **********In the CNN program, Mr. Tower said that if Mr. Bush had indicated that ''he wanted me to withdraw, I would.'' **********Throughout his public appearances today, Mr. Tower's words appeared carefully chosen, his demeanor measured to be neither deeply penitent nor provocatively defiant. One of the few points at which he flashed with anger was when he was asked on the ABC program if he would submit to examinations by doctors chosen by Congress. **********''Would it be a psychiatric examination or something like that?'' he said. ''No, I'm not going to submit to that and why should I? No other Cabinet nominee has ever been required to do that.'' 'I'm a Single Man' **********Mr. Tower's legendary temper also flared when the discussion turned to his relationships with women and the unsubstantiated allegations that he kept mistresses in Geneva while serving as an arms control negotiator. Mr. Tower, who has been married twice, was divorced from his second wife in late 1987. His current companion, Dorothy Heyser, has appeared by his side at his Senate hearings. **********At one point in the ABC program, Mr. Donaldson asked Mr. Tower whether, in light of his pledge not to drink, he should also pledge ''not to go out with women.'' **********''I'm a single man, I do date women,'' Mr. Tower shot back. Wine With Meals **********Describing his drinking habits, Mr. Tower acknowledged that in the 1970's, ''I did drink too much,'' and called himself ''a pretty good Scotch drinker'' in those days. **********''I haven't tasted Scotch in twelve years,'' he said. ''After that, I had only wine. Had perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a little vodka with smoked salmon or caviar or something like that.'' **********Appearing on CNN, Mr. Tower repeated the assertion that since 1976, he had drunk wine with meals, ''champagne, maybe an occasional glass of sherry or port and just occasionally a martini or a vodka.'' **********But he said his consumption of spirits was limited to ''once every five or six weeks or something like that.'' **********''I go for days without drinking anything, not even wine,'' he said. **********The doctor's letter accompanying the written vow said no signs of alcohol abuse were evident in examinations of Mr. Tower before and after an operation in December to remove a malignant polyp from his colon. **********''He exhibited no evidence of alcoholic withdrawal or anxiety during his entire post-operative course and in fact was on the telephone almost continuously throughout his hospital confinement'' with Washington officials, wrote the doctor, Warren E.

A fountain of fireworks erupted behind the wooden stands erected for the privileged few who could actually see the march-past of swiveling African dancers, Russians high-stepping under confetti snow sprayed by trucks painted ''Glasnost'' and British punks dancing under artifical rain. **********Although it was impossible to tell through the bulletproof shield on the balcony of the imposing Navy Ministry, the weary President of the United States had gone to bed. A Thrill on Television **********Yet those who watched the zany parade on television - by far the vast majority of French citizens, not to speak of millions elsewhere in the world - could have been forgiven for imagining Mr. Bush thrilled by the rippling Stars and Stripes, since television cameras had picked up the Marching 100 at the Arc de Triomphe end of the Champs Elysees well before they reached the Place de la Concorde. **********Like President Bush's pilgrimage through Eastern Europe before he got to Paris, the bicentennial of the French Revolution and even the summit of seven industrial nations that will conclude Sunday have the feel of events that have been choreographed not for people on the scene but for television watchers. **********There were a million people present along the Champs Elysees last night, according to the police, but only a small fraction of them actually got to glimpse the parade staged by Jean-Paul Goude, an advertising impresario who gives interviews with a baseball cap screwed backwards on his head. If anybody could translate America's television-driven culture into French it was Mr. Goude, who has an American mother and a French father. **********Yet President Francois Mitterrand, a 72-year-old man of letters who sometimes seems to have leaped straight out of the more serene 19th century, has shown himself to be no global-village slouch either. 'An Infernal Pace' **********''Francois Mitterrand is leading this kaleidoscopic event at an infernal pace, at once producer director and showman,'' wrote Serge July, editor of the daily Liberation, adding that the two-for-the-price-of one summit-bicentennial was a ''model of political Hollywoodism.'' ''The Americans, experts in this kind of patriotic orchestration, must be appreciating it as connaisseurs.'' **********Mr. July defined this week as ''a gigantic television show'' and as ''a piece of theater in five acts that starts with 1789 and that ends with third world debt, drugs and the ozone layer, which is to say the great dramas of today.'' **********By closing off swaths of central Paris to traffic - to protect his important guests - Mr. Mitterrand has created a giant pedestrian zone where tourists and Parisians stroll good-naturedly, but aimlessly, deep into the early morning hours. Yet, unless they repair to a television set, the only spectacle these latter-day sans-culottes can see are the fireworks that, Friday night and again tonight, criss-crossed and exploded in the black sky. Daily Stories in the Press **********The triumph of the televised image may not be a bad thing for this summit, which is afflicted, as drama goes, by an alarming degree of harmony on most issues and does not seem to be producing much of sensational substance. The European press has been doing its best to squeeze daily stories out of perceived or real snubs inflicted by Mr. Mitterrand on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who had the bad taste of remarking before coming to Paris that the French Revolution didn't invent human rights. **********There was drama aplenty last Wednesday when President Bush appeared to speak at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's Solidarity movement. But then his media handlers realized that his speech was about to hit the local weather reports on the breakfast shows back in America; he was made to wait for four minutes so that he could hit the screens live. **********In real-life Gdansk, Mr. Bush's voice was silenced in English so that an interpreter could waft his words to a big Polish crowd in Polish; the American networks, though, relayed their President back home in English. **********Back home they never knew."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/world/spain-losing-backward-image-booms-as-it-lures-foreign-money.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1989-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spain, Losing Backward Image, Booms as It Lures Foreign Money", "print_headline": "Spain, Losing Backward Image, Booms as It Lures Foreign Money", "body_text": " **********With Europe's fastest economic growth rate and foreign investment that has tripled in five years, Spain is turning into the continent's Sun Belt. **********''The Iberian Peninsula is Europe's last frontier,'' said Jorge Hay, director of planning for Banco Hispano Americano in Madrid. **********Spaniards and other Europeans alike used to say, ''Europe stops at the Pyrenees.'' Indeed, during the 36-year reign of Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, many foreigners shunned Spain because of its repressiveness and backwardness. Environment for a Boom **********But foreigners have since embraced Spain in the 1980's as it became a stable democracy. The nation joined the European Community in 1986. In addition, the Socialist Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, has adopted market-oriented policies to create the environment for an economic boom. His Government has removed a prior-approval process for foreign investments, lifted exchange controls on foreign businesses and loosened rules on laying off workers. It has also offered generous incentives to lure foreign companies, especially high-technology concerns. **********''He has taken a very pragmatic approach,'' said Ignacio Trillo, chairman of General Electric Espana. **********Now, with the European Community planning to remove trade barriers by the end of 1992, business has decided that Spain, with its low wages, can be an advantageous place to set up shop within the Community. Investors also are confident that Spain will grow more rapidly than most of Europe because the Spanish have plenty of cars and VCR's to buy to catch up to the French and the Germans. **********''There are not many countries that will grow as fast as Spain,'' said Rainer Klinke, manager of the Madrid office of Deutsche Bank. ''You have to go where the action is.'' **********Tourism is booming, too, even more than in the past. Eight million British tourists flocked to Spain last year in search of sun. And tens of thousands of Germans have bought retirement homes in southern Spain. **********Like the American Sun Belt, Spain has found that sudden growth can bring problems as well. The surge in activity has snarled such services as roads and telephones. Another problem is that the economic boom has hardly dented the nation's unemployment rate, which remains close to 20 percent. **********But that has not stopped American, Japanese and northern European companies from rushing to build factories here. Foreign direct investment in plants and equipment soared to $4 billion last year from $1 billion in 1983. **********''We feel Spain has a lot of potential,'' said George Foyo, managing director in Spain for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Spain's First Chip Factory **********A.T.&T. just opened a $220 million semiconductor factory on a hilly, 400-acre site north of Madrid. It will be the first semiconductor factory in the nation, and Spanish officials lobbied hard to get it. **********''Investment by foreign companies with high-tech expertise is very important for our development,'' said Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, Spain's Deputy Minister of Commerce. **********General Electric plans to build a $1.7 billion plastics plant in southeast Spain, while the Ford Motor Company is constructing a $68 million plant in the southwest to make electronic components for cars. Nissan Motor, Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial have opened factories near Barcelona, and Volkswagen has bought a majority share in what had been Spain's state-owned automobile company. Other Forms of Investment **********Investment has taken other forms as well. A 50-story condominium tower that will be one of Europe's tallest buildings is under construction in Benidorm, a seaside resort on Spain's east coast. Japanese developers are building retirement communities along the coast, while Dutch investors have built hundreds of greenhouses in the torrid south to grow tomatoes and cucumbers to sell in northern Europe. **********Many Spaniards say their nation has become the Florida of Europe because of the many retirees, while other call it the California of Europe because its huge agricultural production and high-tech aspirations. **********Thanks to developments like these, Spain's economy grew by more than 5 percent and capital invesment soared by 15 percent over each of the last two years - numbers far stronger than those of most other European nations. **********''People often talk about the Big Four in Europe - Germany, France, Italy and Britain - but that is becoming an outmoded notion and we might have to start talking someday soon about the Five,'' said John Picard, an economist with DRI Europe, an economic consulting group. Becoming 'Europeanized' **********Joining the European elite will mean making some changes in life and work styles. At the A.T.&T. semiconductor factory, for example, workers take a 45-minute lunch, rather than the two- to two-and-a-half-hour lunch customary in Spain. **********''They've become Europeanized,'' said Reginald East, a retired British mathematics teacher who has moved to a beach house near Alicante, on Spain's southeast coast. ''They've adopted some of the hustle and bustle of Britain and America, but I'm not sure how good a thing it all is.'' **********The Mediterranean coast from Valencia to Marbella has become a retirement haven for German, Dutch, Danish and British citizens. Spanish officials estimate that 300,000 foreigners have retired to Spain, but some economists say a million would be a more accurate figure because foreign residents often do not register. 'A Concrete Jungle' **********''When we started coming here on vacation 18 years ago, this was a sleepy, sandy village,'' Mr. East said of his retirement town, Playa San Juan. ''But now there are tower blocks left, right and center. It has become a concrete jungle.'' **********But the spectacular economic growth of recent years has hardly dented the devastating unemployment rate in a country that has one of Europe's fastest-growing populations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments estimates that Spain had an unemployment rate of 19.5 percent last year, by far the highest rate in Europe. The 1970's oil shocks, economic mismanagement and political instability after Franco's death in 1975 all took a serious toll on Spain's economy. As a result, Spain's unemployment rate soared from 2.2 percent in 1973 to 21.5 percent in 1985, according to the O.E.C.D. **********There are other problems, too. Poverty is prevalent in many rural areas, and there are many criticisms of the quality of education. Purse snatchings and car break-ins are common. Basic Services Overloaded **********The explosion in economic growth has overloaded basic services. It can take 90 minutes to commute from a suburb 18 miles outside Madrid, and some businesses cannot move into their new offices because it takes four months to have a phone installed. **********''The economy is growing way faster than the infrastructure,'' Mr. Foyo, the A.T.&T. executive, said. ''That's a basic problem, but those problems will be solved.'' The Government has begun a multibillion-dollar program to modernize the nation's antiquated road and railroad system. **********Probably the Government's biggest fear right now is that mounting labor unrest will deflate the Spanish miracle. With economic growth and corporate profits up sharply, Spain's unions are demanding higher wages. But Prime Minister Gonzalez and corporations are reluctant to meet the unions' demands for fear of pushing up inflation, which the Government says can end up slowing growth and increasing unemployment. The inflation rate has been running at about 5 percent for the past two years. Concern of European Unions **********Unions in other European countries, meanwhile, are concerned that they will lose jobs to lower-paid Spanish workers. Volkswagen workers in West Germany, for example, fear that their company will shift production of certain lines to a lower-wage factory in Pamplona, Spain, if the German workers do not grant concessions. **********''Some companies are moving to the south because of weaker unions and lower wages,'' said Ramon Tamames, a left-wing Spanish economist. **********One of the leading foreign investors in Spain is Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., the automobile parts company based in Stuttgart, West Germany. **********''Spain has a good cost position compared with the rest of Europe, and it will maintain that for some years,'' said Herbert Meyer, director of Bosch's Spanish operations, which employ 5,000 workers. ''When Spanish workers use the same technology as German workers, I don't see any major differences in their productivity.'' Land Prices a Factor **********Mr. Trillo, the G.E. executive, said his company chose to build its plastics factory in Spain, not because of cheap labor, but because Spain is one of the few European countries where large tracts of inexpensive land are still available. The factory, to be situated on a 1,700-acre site, is expected to employ 1,500 workers and have annual revenues close to $1 billion. **********But Mr. Trillo said the availability of land was not the only reason. **********''We selected Spain because it's a country of the future,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/business/company-news-komori-at-7.7-seeks-all-of-am.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Komori, at 7.7%, Seeks All of AM", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Komori, at 7.7%, Seeks All of AM", "body_text": " **********The Komori Printing Machinery Company, a Japanese concern, requested the right to make an offer to acquire all of the shares of AM International Inc. that it does not already own for $6.25 a share in cash, or a total of about $300 million.

Paul, have lived on a patch of land near Lake Champlain with a majestic view of the Adirondack Mountains. When they moved in, the parcel also contained a 150-by-215-foot-long train path, part of an easement, or right of way, granted by the property owner in 1899. **********Fourteen years ago, Vermont and the railway ripped up the tracks. Rather than returning the path to the Preseaults, the rail was turned into an asphalt trail, and whizzing bicylists and meandering pedestrians replaced the clamorous trains. Mrs. Preseault says she does not mind the traffic, but she and her husband want the property back, or at least some compensation if it is to be used by hikers and bikers. The action, Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission, is no small matter. **********Each year, about 3,000 miles of train tracks around the nation are abandoned, and how the Supreme Court decides the Preseault case could determine who benefits and who loses from the policy of converting unused rail paths into trails. **********Thirteen states have joined with Vermont, the Bush Administration and a number of conservation and trail associations in arguing that there is nothing wrong with converting rails to trails. The Preseaults' supporters include several farm groups and the National Association of Realtors, which contend that since the original easement was for train tracks, the Government must compensate the Preseaults for the conversion. The case began nine years ago, when the Preseaults asked a Vermont court to decide who owns the strip of land. In 1985, the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the action. It reasoned that only the Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates railroads, had the authority to decide whether the rail line had been abandoned. **********Two years earlier, Congress had amended the National Trails System Act to increase the number of trails at minimal cost to the Government. The amendments gave the I.C.C. the authority to transfer rail easements to a local government or private organizations that would assume liability and upkeep. Based on the new law, the commission in 1986 approved a rails-to-trails conversion agreement with Burlington. **********Lawyers for the Preseaults argued last month that the Federal law amounts to a taking without just compensation, which is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment. They also maintained that the rails-to-trails policy exceeds the commerce clause of the Constitution, because the professed interstate interest of the Federal Government - banking abandoned rail paths for possible use in the future - is a sham. **********''The fact is, and everyone will admit it off the record, railroad banking for the future is a fiction,'' said Michael Berger, a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Fadem, Berger & Norton, who represented the Preseaults before the Supreme Court. **********Lawyers for the Federal Government contend that the conversion to trails is an economical way to preserve the paths in case train tracks are again installed. **********A unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York agreed, dismissing the argument that the rail banking was a sham and calling the preservation of the rail corridors ''remarkably efficient.'' The appeals panel also rejected the notion that the easement granted in 1899 was for the specific purpose of running only a railroad track. **********Rarely has the Supreme Court struck down a law because it violates the commerce clause, and experts expect that if the Preseaults prevail, it would likely be on principle of eminent domain - that they have a right to be compensated for the seizure of their property. That would be only a partial victory because it would mean that the couple and others would have to continue to pursue their cases in the United States Court of Claims. **********For his part, Mr. Preseault, a former pilot at Eastern Airlines who was told by the airline that his job had been filled when the pilots' union voted recently to return to work, says the case is a simple matter of being left alone. He disagrees with the National Wildlife Federation, the National Audubon Society and Natural Resources Defense Council, which want to preserve the trails for the public. **********''They can't resist meandering off the bicycle path onto our property,'' he said, referring to the cyclists and hikers. ''We don't like being ornery people by asking them to leave. We turn out looking like bad guys. They ask 'What's the harm?' The harm is we lose all our privacy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/12/world/us-officials-urge-labor-to-remain-in-israeli-cabinet.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. OFFICIALS URGE LABOR TO REMAIN IN ISRAELI CABINET", "print_headline": "U.S. OFFICIALS URGE LABOR TO REMAIN IN ISRAELI CABINET", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration has told Israeli political leaders that it hopes the Labor Party will not leave the coalition Government in Jerusalem, American officials said today. **********The officials said that if the Labor Party pulled out of the coalition it would set back efforts to arrange elections among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Prospects for such elections were already set back as a result of hard-line conditions endorsed last week by the Likud party, they said. **********The United States conveyed its concerns to Israel through diplomatic channels and through intermediaries, including leaders of American Jewish groups, the officials said. 'The Most Realistic Way' **********Even though few Palestinians have supported Israel's plan for elections in the occupied territories, the United States contends that the proposal is still alive and represents ''the most realistic way to advance the peace process.'' **********An Israeli official said: ''We got the message. The U.S. believes that dissolution of the national unity Government means an election campaign in Israel, and that means a period of uncertainty during which no Israeli government can pursue the peace process.'' **********State Department officials said that while they did not want to interfere in Israel's domestic politics, a high-level American delegation scheduled to visit Israel next week would express the United States' preference that Labor stay in the coalition Government. **********The mission to Israel was originally intended to determine if the Israeli Government was still committed to its proposal for elections in the territories. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud party raised questions about their commitment when they attached several hard-line conditions to the proposal last week. Mr. Baker described the conditions as ''unhelpful.'' New Urgency to Mission **********The mission to Israel was given new urgency and an additional purpose after Labor Party leaders recommended on Monday that Labor leave the coalition. The party will probably not make a final decision for at least three weeks, American and Israeli officials said. **********''The Israeli peace process should be given every possible chance of success,'' a Bush Administration official said. ''Keeping Israel's unity Government together is critical to that process.'' **********The official said Mr. Baker and the Bush Administration had a substantial political investment in Mr. Shamir's Palestinian election proposal and did not want to see it wither. In sending a team of officials, Mr. Baker said, he wanted to make certain that the Israelis were ''as committed to this proposal as we have been, if we're going to continue to strongly support it, as we do.'' **********Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said today that he spoke to Israeli leaders over the weekend and told them that it was ''important for the unity Government to stay together.'' **********The conference of presidents met today in New York, discussed the political situation in Israel and reaffirmed its support for Mr. Shamir's peace plan, including the proposal for Palestinians to elect representatives who would negotiate with Israel. **********Some members of the Labor Party and many Palestinians contend that the conditions adopted by the Likud last week would kill the proposal for elections in the territories. Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the conditions dealt ''a deadly blow'' to the proposal. U.S. Considers Proposal Alive **********But the Bush Administration, like Mr. Shamir, maintains that the proposal is still alive because the Israeli Government has not formally changed its terms. ''We deal with governments,'' Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Thursday. **********State Department officials said Mr. Baker had not decided who would be in the American delegation to Israel. Among the possible envoys, they said, are Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State; Dennis B. Ross, director of the State Department's policy planning staff, and John H. Kelly, the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. **********The lower the level of the delegation, the less risk there would be that the visitors might be seen as interfering in Israel's domestic politics. **********Israeli officials said they saw nothing inappropriate in the United States' expression of concern about the future of Israel's coalition Government. ''Because of the intensity and intimacy of the relationship between our two countries, we have gotten used to such intervention and do not see it as meddling,'' one official said. **********American officials said the United States has expressed its views through William A. Brown, the Ambassador to Israel, and in informal comments by State Department officials to Israeli diplomats and political leaders. International Conference Opposed **********Israeli officials have taken exception to the United States' suggestion over the weekend that it would have to consider organizing an international peace conference on the Middle East if there was no progress on the proposal for Palestinian elections. **********An Israeli official said today that such comments were ''unhelpful'' because they encouraged Palestinians to believe that they could obtain a peace conference by simply refusing to show any interest in the Israeli proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/07/business/company-news-mgm-ua-awaits-deposit-by-qintex.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 211, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MGM/UA Awaits Deposit by Qintex", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MGM/UA Awaits Deposit by Qintex", "body_text": " **********The MGM/UA Communications Company said the Qintex Group of Australia, which has agreed to acquire MGM/UA for $1.45 billion, was late delivering a $50 million deposit.

The reports concerned purported restrictions on African students' Chinese girlfriends and the reported torture of African students by Chinese police. African Students' View **********While African students interviewed by telephone from Nanjing unanimously agreed that some such students had been tortured by the police, they also said that they did not know of any new rules about their girlfriends.

President Bush met with nine Republican senators, who complained to him that the White House had not been doing enough for the measure. **********The President dispatched both his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, to Capitol Hill to lobby for the bill, particularly among skeptical Republicans, who were warned that if the measure failed the Nicaraguan opposition would be completely cut off. **********''The presidential candidate of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, Violeta Chamorro, has told us that the opposition needs our assistance desperately, and that only by receiving help can it make a real contest of this election,'' President Bush said in a letter to leaders of the Senate. **********Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, described the Administration appeal this way: ''You may not like this. It may make you gag. But you better vote for this or it's nothing at all.'' Amendments Rejected **********Supporters of the money won a crucial vote earlier in the day to cut off debate, 74-25, and then successfully fended off several amendments that would have gutted the bill. **********One of these was an amendment by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who proposed to bar any spending that would have gone directly or indirectly to the Sandinistas. This would have had the effect of cutting off the money to the opposition parties because those contributions would have been taxed by a government agency. **********Mr. Harkin's amendment was defeated 59-40, the closest vote of the day on the issue. Three Republicans, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Mr. Helms and Larry Pressler of South Dakota, joined 37 Democrats in seeking to block the aid to the Nicaraguan opposition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/business/time-for-the-jitters-in-junk-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1989-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time for the Jitters in Junk Bonds", "print_headline": "Time for the Jitters in Junk Bonds", "body_text": " **********For years financial Cassandras have warned of the dangers of ''junk bonds.'' The rapidly expanding market for these low-rated, high-yield securities was hastily erected on a small, fragile and inadequate foundation, they said, and sooner or later many companies issuing the bonds would be unable to meet their debt payments, leaving bond holders without buyers when they wanted to sell. **********It appears that 1989 might be the year that at least some of these warnings come true. Despite one of the strongest rallies in recent years in Treasury bonds, the junk bond market has steadily weakened. For the first six months of the year, the total return - interest plus price appreciation - of junk bonds tracked by the First Boston High-Yield Index, a leading indicator, was 5.4 percent, while the total return of 10-year Treasury bonds was 11.2 percent. **********''All markets move in cycles,'' said Barbara L. Kenworthy, portfolio manager of several bond funds at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''We're getting near the end of a cycle and there will be more of a shakeout.'' **********Whether this year's events add up to a shakeout remains to be seen, but the junk bond market clearly is going through a period of considerable turbulence. **********One of the more striking changes appears to be the emergence of a two-tier structure in which the demand for junk bonds of large, well-known companies like RJR Nabisco, Duracell and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich remains relatively strong while the market for smaller, less-actively traded issues is showing selling pressure and soft prices. **********Not everyone in the market is alarmed. Indeed, many participants argue that brave investors have a chance now to buy bonds at bargain prices. **********''This is likely to represent a buying opportunity,'' said Zane E. Brown, executive vice president of Equitable Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, which has $1.9 billion invested in junk bonds. ''There are going to be select issues that do well.'' **********In any event, the turbulence has been felt in a number of ways this year: *********** Concerns that some mutual funds and Wall Street dealers are overvaluing many high-yield bonds by carrying them on their books at inflated prices have sparked an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission that could result in new regulations. *********** Some bond holders are finding it difficult to sell some of their securities in the secondary market, and they are having to accept prices at much lower levels than the previous valuation. Bonds of Resorts International have declined by 40 percent this year, for example, and securities issued by Tracor and Interco are down by 38 percent. *********** The mix of investors is changing, and in ways that could signal a weakening in demand. The supply of junk bonds continues to explode: in the first half of this year, new bonds totaling $20.2 billion were issued, up from $9.2 billion for the same period in 1988. But new buyers this year largely have been foreign institutions, a group that has shown itself in the past to be highly fickle. And under legislation proposed late last month, savings and loan institutions would be forced to liquidate their junk bonds over the next five years. *********** Concern about the health of the economy is causing some junk bond investors to rethink their holdings, given that many heavily indebted companies would have trouble meeting their debt payments in a recession. Indeed, a number of big junk bond issuers already have filed for bankruptcy protection this year, including the Southmark Corporation and Eastern Airlines. *********** Investors have also been shaken by the legal difficulties surrounding Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Michael R. Milken. Earlier this year, Drexel, which pioneered the use of junk bonds, agreed to a settlement with the S.E.C. related to allegations involving Mr. Milken, who built the Drexel junk bond machine. Mr. Milken, who left Drexel in the spring, has been charged with racketeering and securities fraud, allegations he denies. Several corporate and state pension fund executives liquidated their junk bond portfolios in the wake of the Milken flap. **********All of these considerations are weighing heavily on the $200 billion junk bond market. One of the investors' key concerns is trading liquidity - the ability to buy or sell without causing big price swings. **********No one measures the trading liquidity in the junk bond market, but money managers say that it appears to have declined this year. ''Generally speaking there might be a little less liquidity in issues this year,'' said Mr. Brown of Equitable Capital Management. **********So far, traders have found buyers when they decided to sell the bonds of the first-tier companies like RJR. But as so often happens in illiquid markets, the selling pressure is disrupting the prices of the smaller issues. **********When the trustee for several junk bond investment trusts put together by Drexel liquidated the securities in recent months, the difference between the previous valuation and the actual prices the trusts received was as high as 20 percent, according to traders. **********Pricing differences like these have attracted the attention of regulators in Washington. After all, if the prices that mutual fund and pension fund managers are using to value the bonds in their portfolios do not adequately reflect what they can receive in the market, then their customers are being misled, say money managers. And if the values of the funds are indeed inflated, investors' fees - which are based on the market value of the securities - could be overstated as well. **********The S.E.C. refuses to confirm or deny whether it is investigating pricing practices. But several mutual fund managers say they have responded to agency questionnaires. **********Some in the industry view the Government inquiry as a positive step that could add more legitimacy to what has been considered a market of mavericks. ''We would welcome any kind of move by the S.E.C. and others that would inspire confidence in the pricing of these securities,'' said Greg Scott, a spokesman for the Alliance for Capital Access, a Washington-based trade association that represents companies issuing high-yield bonds. **********No one knows for certain whether the prices currently used to value mutual funds reflect the market value of the bonds they hold. Prices always fall when sellers enter the market, of course, and investors would be naive to expect otherwise. But some portfolio managers speculate that the prices of as many as one-third of the 2,500 high-yield securities could be overstated, and that the overvaluation could be between 5 and 15 percent. Several months ago, Barron's ran an article detailing practices that inflated prices as much as 30 percent. **********To be sure, the pricing and liquidity problems with junk bonds occur to varying degrees in all markets whenever investors try to sell large blocks of assets. Nevertheless, the problem in the junk bond market appears to be more acute because of its smaller size and structure. Like the market for Treasury bonds and over-the-counter stocks, the market for junk bonds is a ''dealer'' market. Instead of trading securities on an exchange, buyers and sellers trade with a small group of Wall Street underwriters and market makers. These underwriters and market makers often are pricing bonds that have not traded for weeks or months. Because there is no central reporting of trades, those doing the pricing may be unaware of some trades, which explains some price disparities. **********In the secondary market, the leading firms are Drexel, First Boston, Morgan Stanley & Company, Goldman Sachs & Company, Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities. **********Executives at some of the largest mutual fund organizations in the country defend the way junk bonds are valued and insist that their shareholders are being treated fairly. Individuals have invested $35.2 billion in almost 100 junk bond funds in recent years, according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade association. **********In order to value its portfolio, for instance, Fidelity Investments calls dealers every day for prices of the more than 200 junk bonds it holds. And the company says that these prices are ''quite close'' to the prices that it receives when it sells the securities. ''We feel things are in order,'' said Arthur S. Loring, general counsel of the Fidelity Management and Research Company, a subsidiary. **********Other organizations, like T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, say they rely on outside pricing services offered by firms such as Merrill Lynch and the Interactive Data Corporation to supplement the quotes they receive from Wall Street dealers. **********Unlike specialists on the floor at the stock exchange, who are required to make orderly markets, the half-dozen junk bond market makers have no such obligations to their clients. And executives at Wall Street firms said it is unrealistic for investors to expect dealers to provide liquidity in nervous markets. In such markets, dealers will make bids at lower prices to justify the risk of owning the bonds, or they will wait for market conditions to improve before making a bid, the executives said. **********''If something is more risky, it is less liquid,'' said Alan Schlesinger, senior vice president and head of high-yield trading at Donaldson Lufkin. ''At this point in time, we have provided more than enough capital for what we're asked to do.'' **********Traders also say that investors will have to accept lower prices for some of the smaller issues because there may be only one market maker, the original underwriter. Some firms do not provide research on, or make secondary markets in, bonds of small companies unless they were the original underwriter and know the company's financial condition. **********''We're not going to bid for something we don't know about,'' said David M. Malcolm, managing director and head of high-yield investment banking at the First Boston Corporation. **********How much capital is actually committed to Wall Street trading desks in this market is impossible to determine. The underwriters who make the markets are the only ones who know how much they are committing, and they are not saying. **********Obviously investors would like to see more trading by the market makers to cushion market disruptions. Some said they would like to see the Wall Street firms use some of the profits they have made from junk bond underwritings to increase the capital committed to secondary trading. ''If there were a way to set up regulations for market makers, it would be a good thing for the legitimization of the market,'' said Mr. Scott of the Alliance for Capital Access. **********Whether the S.E.C. recommends more regulation for the market is conjecture at this point. But recent events have demonstrated to investors in junk bonds that prices do not always go straight up. And some investors doubt that the high returns achieved in the past will resume if pricing practices are tightened up. **********To protect their clients, many fund managers say that they have been directing their cash into large, actively traded junk bond issues. They hope this will insure that they can find buyers if there is a need to sell quickly. But that may not be good enough. As stock market investors discovered in 1987, selling in a market dominated by institutions can send prices plummeting.

''And if the prisoner faints or is not healthy enough to take all the strokes, he can order the punishment postponed.'' Ban Urged by Rights Group **********The number of strokes cannot exceed 18 for adults and 6 for children under 14 years old. Children are permitted to have their parents present at the caning, or flogging as it is commonly called here. **********The punishment is permitted for a number of crimes ranging from drug possession to robbery or assault, and can be ordered in lieu of or in addition to prison. In one important instance - possession of a weapon - the law mandates that an offender be given a minimum sentence of six months in prison or a flogging. Magistrates, the judicial officials who preside over the lower criminal courts where flogging is ordered, have complained that to spare a young offender prison time, they must order him whipped. **********In the last few years the number of people flogged has been as high as 21. But in 1987 it dropped to one, so rights groups were disturbed by the increase to eight last year. **********In November, the United Nations Human Rights Committee asserted that Hong Kong's use of flogging was in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and urged that it be outlawed. The Hong Kong Government has begun a review of the issue. 'No Need to Change' Laws **********But after several similar reviews of the corporal punishment laws in the last few years, Hong Kong ''found no need to change them,'' according to Nancy Law, Principal Assistant Secretary with the Security Branch, which oversees Government legal policy. **********No official reason has been given for continuing a punishment that was abandoned in Britain long ago. **********While a small but increasingly vocal number of Hong Kong residents have been lobbying for more democracy, for more civil rights, such groups have generally been unconcerned with the issue of corporal punishment. For example, the Bar Association of Hong Kong, which has been advocating legal and political changes that would give the colony a ''truly democratic system,'' has not taken a stand against flogging. **********''It's not an issue we are involved with,'' a bar official said. **********Miss Law of the Security Branch said: ''We do not have to give a reason for keeping a law in place. We only give explanations when we change a law.'' 'Cruel and Degrading' **********Privately, British officials say that the Chinese, who make up 98 percent of Hong Kong's population, prefer a sterner justice, and that local laws reflect their preferences. But some British and Chinese lawyers question whether the Government really has a clear mandate for continuing the floggings. **********Ian MacCallum, a lawyer and chairman of the human-rights group Justice, said his group had been pressing for the abolition of flogging for many years ''because it is a cruel and degrading punishment.'' The Executive Council - a handful of community leaders appointed by the Governor, Sir David Wilson - would have to approve the change. **********But Mr. MacCallum said: ''The Government's attitude is that there is no great public outcry against flogging, and therefore, most people must favor it. They like to think that it's a majority.'' **********A prominent Hong Kong lawyer, Daniel R. Fung, said there was a ''widely held perception among the British establishment that the Chinese prefer some form of authoritarian government - stern but benevolent - and that is what they are giving them.'' Too Little Pressure for Change **********''I don't say this cynically,'' he said. ''I think they really believe they are giving the people what they want, but without elections, without democracy, they can't really know what the people want.'' **********He said that he did not believe there was a large constituency in favor of flogging, but that without ''enormous public pressure for change, the Government assumes the status quo is satisfactory.'' **********Some magistrates have criticized the punishment as cruel and barbaric and have repeatedly asked that it be abolished or made totally discretionary. **********''The pressure isn't just coming from outside,'' a Hong Kong lawyer said. Is It a Majority View?  Henry Litton, another widely respected lawyer, said that flogging was a ''Victorian relic of a bygone age.'' but he contended that to say the Chinese favor flogging was ''too simplistic.'' **********''I think the problem is that certainly the more conservative elements in the Chinese community favor these measures, and they tend to be more vocal, and their views tend to get more attention,'' he said. **********Moreover, the periodic public debate over the question of canings shows that even some British residents support the punishment. **********The wife of a British lawyer, for example, said: ''If one's property has been seriously damaged or if, God forbid, one's children have been injured or robbed, what's wrong with caning those responsible? I think it's a fine idea.'' Gradual Move Toward Revisions **********Mr. MacCallum conceded that ''the local population of Hong Kong does tend to favor fairly draconian punishments,'' which, he added, was why the colony still has a death penalty, and why homosexuality is still on the books as an offense punishable by life imprisonment. **********But he pointed out that the death penalty is automatically reversed on appeal to the high court in Britain, where the death penalty was abolished in 1968. Moreover, he said, Hong Kong rarely prosecutes homosexuals, ''unless it is something really offensive, something, say, involving children,'' and no one can remember anyone being sentenced to life in prison for homosexuality. **********With China preparing to take over the territory in 1997, Mr. MacCallum said, ''there is a gradual move toward reforming some of these harsher laws.'' **********Mr. Fung agreed that ''a lot of people are going on now about judicial house cleaning, saying we ought to eliminate flogging, the death penalty and other hard laws'' because the Chinese will certainly use them with more frequency and impunity than the British. **********But he said: ''Even if you assume the new government will be wonderfully benevolent, that is still no reason for maintaining these controversial punishments. A government ought to lead its people, not pander to them.''"}}
